This medication caused swelling in my legs and very hard to find at the pharmacy. I have to order it in advance,2,3,3
causes headache and dizziness ,5,1,2
My blood pressure is good but I have very dry eyes to the point that by the end of the day they are burning....and the first week or 2 severe stomach pains but that has subsided.,4,4,4
This medication has helped stabilize my pressure but i noticed muscle soreness in my legs and sort of heart throbbing to where it seems as though the the ground or surface is shaking below me,5,3,4
"I have mild to moderate hypertension untreated. I don't have any kidney disease or diabetes.  Tried Diovan, Exforge, Cardura, HCTZ which did not work well.. Valturna has been great BP 110/70 with no side effects. ",5,5,5

"I would just like to know why when I try to get the info on this drug from this site  such as side affects ect. nothing comes up seems to be that most of my meds. I have tried to research are doing the same thing. They don't give me info on this site. I'm taking furosemide 40 mg. for water retention, spironolactone 25 mg. for water retention,bisoprolol 5mg. to slow heart rate and lower blood pressure and aliskiren 300 mg. for  high blood pressure. Had to stop spironolactone due to rectal bleeding and stomach pain. I am asthmatic and am really having hard time breathing after I take bisoprolol. I am going to slowly get off this drug, as I have found out that asthmatics should not be taking it. The doctor that prescribed this drug knows I am an asthmatic. Now I'm being sent to a asthma doctor as my asthma is out of control. So they will probably add some more drug and then more side affects and the cycle continues. My blood pressure has dropped to a normal level and the water pills are draining the excess fluid away, but I am so fatigued I can hardly walk around my home let alone exercise or even have a sense of feeling well. I am so tired all the time and fall asleep sitting up. My Cardiologist said I will feel this way for at least  six months until my body adjusts to these pills. I just don't think one should feel so unwell from medications that are suppose to make you well. I felt better before I started taking these medications even though my blood pressure was extremely high and I looked like a swollen marsh-mellow.",3,3,3
My cardiologist gave me samples of this med- ication before my local pharmacy stocked. I have noticed no side effects. I take it with my a.m. meds.,5,5,5

"it does a fair job of lowering BP but has an endless amount of side effects. Extreme Hair loss, rapid weight gain, muscle soreness, pins and needle feelings, gas and bloating, depression and others to many to mention. This medicine should be taken off the market in my opinion. Very expensive price to pay to be miserable.",1,1,1
5mg ..after 2 days I am wondering why my nerves are so bad and feeling down and depressed.... I will try it longer and update....  But I am not liking it so far. Also I wish these were split into male and female as different meds act differently with sexes and weights ...Female  145lb  ,2,2,2
Feet swell up .,4,1,2
When i started using this med..i feel anxious depressed almost 6 months ..bullshit..,1,1,2
After two days of treatment I suffered severe swelling in my face. Had to go emgcare to for steroid shot to bring down swelling.,3,1,1
It will cause weight gain big time. I have been taking this drug for 10 years now. I went from 190lbs to 240lbs in ten years and I am a pure vegetarian. Vegies and fruits only. I go to the gym every day. Come to find out today this drug can cause cancer too. I will get a different drug today.,5,2,5
"On 5 mg.  Will be almost 3 weeks that I've been taking it.  Haven't noticed much of a change in blood pressure yet.  Since I started taking it, I have had terrible insomnia.  My heart is pounding a lot, even at rest.  Have a funky taste in my mouth all day long. Guess I better try something different. ",3,1,1
for those of us still with our teeth-long term this drug will wreck havoc on your teeth and gums. Can't complain on it's effectiveness with my HBP though.,5,1,3
"I switched from Losartan to Amlodipine about a month ago after many bad side affects from the Losartan. Although the Losartan did a much better job actually lowering my blood pressure, I have not experienced any side affects so far from the Amlodipine. ",4,4,3
"It helped bring my BP down to normal levels; however, it is difficult to swallow since it does not have a protective coating and leaves a very unpleasant residue in my throat.",2,3,4
"The diamond shape pill catches on my esophagus and I DRINK LOTS OF WATER WITH IT.  tHE OLDER WE GET, OUR ESOPHAGUS WRINKLES LIKE OUR BODIES AND WE DO NOT WANT AN ULCER IF IT DOES NOT GO DOWN PROPERLY.  SHOULD BE ROUND PILLS IN STEAD.",1,1,5
Please do not use this drug. it is just NASTY!! feels like your entire system is being poisoned especially if you are sensitive to calcium channel blockers.,4,1,1
I have been on this drug since having severe blood pressure and other problems from being prescribed too  high a dosage of diabetes drug a year ago. I have had severe pain and some swelling in my feet and thought it could have been from another drug I started at the same for bladder failure.  I have noticed a dark colorization of my bottom legs and thought it was from sun exposure and affects from a medication - the dis-colorization is still there and I now believe it is Amlopodipine that has caused this.  I am now discontinuing this med and will consult my mephrologist.,2,1,2
"my legs and feet have started to swell and I have terrible dreams when I do sleep,  I also feel anxoius",1,1,2
"Taking 5mg am, way to dizzy.  Started to break the pill in 1/2 helped with the dizziness.",4,3,4
"I've been prescribed this a few times, each time no matter what the dosage, I get bad swelling in my ankles and feet. The problem stops in a day or two when I go off the drug, so I know its the drug. It does appear to lower my BP somewhat, but the side effects outweigh the benefit especially since the side effects prevent me from exercising and at times, my legs physically hurt.",5,1,3
"This medicine has made me anxious, very easily upset,  have strange thoughts, lightheaded, my legs and knees hurt, tired all the time but I can't sleep.  All in all, a TERRIBLE experience.  Never taking this again.",4,1,4
Lowing my blood pressure.,5,5,5
"My dissatisfaction stems from the swelling in my lower legs/ankles.  To the extent that I ended up with a burning pain on the apex of my left ankle bone.  Could never wear sandals and after discontinuing, I realized the medicine was the cause of the swelling and burning.  In addition, it appears (now off Amodipine for 2+ weeks) that it - or the swelling - was causing some balance issues - which I attribute to a loss of leg strength.  For these reasons, I'm moving to another treatment option. ",4,1,4
I take 5 mg once daily and am 80 years old. I started taking about 6 months ago after the lisinopril caused coughing.The main side effect is urine retention for which I also take meds.,4,4,4

"I started taking Amlodipine 10 mg with Losartan 50 mg to control my high blood pressure not too long ago. I do not have any side effects so far. Knock on wood! My blood pressure is now average 120-130/70-80 range. I decided to post my review because majority of reviews are pretty scary. Remember happy customers tell 3 people and angry customers tell 3000, so the same rule applies. The side effects are usually rare, and severe side effects (scary reviews you can find in this review) are extremely rare. If your doctor recommends it, try it out. You can quit anytime if you get any side effects you cannot live with.",4,4,3
"I am pharmacologist and I am using amlodipine (5 mg) with telmisartan (40 mg) since last 2 years because BP was 170/100. Combination was working fine. 6 months ago, suddenly I felt very awkwaard (Dizziness, disequilibrium, painfull stomach), I consult with cardiologist and he told to take only Telmisartan. before month I had severe stomach problem, So I thought it is because of Telmisartan. So I stopped telmisartan too. finally spent 10-15 days without medicine (No amlodipine no Telmisartan). Now BP was found 140/90. I thought to start amlodipine. Because of recent side effects, I stopped Telmisartan and started again Amlodipine. But, now Amlodipine is giving very odd feeling, though not swelling but stomach is hurting most, constipation (First time in life I felt stool is not passing), pain in legs, knee, slight in ankle.  3 days gone without amlodipine still effects not gone. I have decided will not take medicine either of it, going for exercise, diet and yoga. Never amlodipine again. I dont have cholesterol, sugar, no nicotine or alcohol consume. Only stress and loneliness has made me hypertensive. I have decided to lower bp without medicine. Listening music, talking more, walking 4-5 km. More water, less salt, yoga in morning. ",4,1,4
"BP came down a little, dr wanted to up the dose, but now legs are sore and veins swollen. Muscles very painful, affecting walking. Dont know if I want to take this?",5,2,2

Severe Migraine headaches and increased Blood Pressure,5,1,1
"I began after my bp shot up for no apparent reason to 190/90. My physician's assistant started me on this med. I took faithfully. About one week ago, my bp shot up one evening (after a long trip of heavy traffic) and was diastolic at over 90 again. I began the second tab immediately. I am a bit more dizzy, but my bp is coming down under 140/80 for the first time. I will enter a follow-up report in about two months. ",3,3,3

I started taking Amlodipine in Oct 2017 I noticed my hair is so much thinner but worse is my legs and calves swell so much they feel very heavy my doc seems to think the side affects out weigh the risks of HPB. I called her again and she is willing to change me something else hopefully I won't have tree stumps for legs very long .,3,1,3
The swelling  has included my legs as well as my feet. Some what painful.,1,1,4
"Major hair loss after being on this drug Amlodipine for four months. Once I was off it took another couple of months for my hair to stop breaking at the roots like that, I would run my fingers through my hair and WOW, a number of strands from the roots each time was coming out, this was totally different from normal breakage at the end, it definitely was cause for alarm, unlike anything I had ever seen with my hair, and no my hair wasnÃ¢Â?Â?t thinning because of age, my hair has always been thick and in very good condition. It did control my blood pressure, now I am on something else without hair loss as being one of the side effects.",2,1,2
"At five mgs, I began to have a sore tongue and canker sores in my mouth. I got worse tinnitus and also lost much of my tasting ability. I felt weak and tired a lot, and just did not feel right. When I stopped this medicine, all my bad symptoms disappeared and I feel normal again and my taste has come back. I will just stick to micardis and dump all other blood pressure drugs.",1,1,2
The generics are mostly not effective,4,3,3
"About 5 months now. Has lowered my BP from 158/92 to 123/71 but I'm dizzy frequently. Maybe it's to low for me? But side effects are the big problem. Taking 5mg and still have rashes on neck, terrible tendinitis day and night. Swelling neck glands, headaches, brain fog, lower back pain and itching different place everyday. Not a glowing review for sure. LOL I felt better with high blood pressure. Stopping the drug today.   ",4,1,3
"I have tried this twice, and it works for about an hour, and my blood pressure shoots back up.",3,1,1

"Used to get this medication in the round blue pill imprinted with A10, M physician directed me to split the pill in half only taking 5mg.  This medication was somewhat effective in treating my high blood pressure.  Last refill the pharmacy sent me a different pill that is a white round tablet imprinted with IG 239.  After taking this new half pill for a week, it is not effective in treating my blood pressure.  My symptoms are high blood pressure, swelling in feet, pounding heartbeats, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision and generally feeling ill and irritable.  ",1,1,1

Could not sleep, nightmares, I think I was having panic attacks too, night sweats, heart racing, jittery all over, feeling sick at my stomach, grouchy and very miserable. I got maybe got one hour of sleep a night for quite awhile and my body refused to let me sleep in the daytime also. I have not taken it for 3 days and am feeling so much better I could almost shout. Been able to sleep too.  I was also on hydralazine and had same reaction. I sure don't recommend them. Didn't help my b/p either.",1,1,1

"I just gave this drug a good review a couple weeks back after just taking it a short time. I'll have to rescind those comments. After being on it a couple more weeks, the bad side effects were coming on strong. Headaches, dizzy, bad moods, even put on a couple pounds. The last thing I need for high BP is something that makes me put on more weight. ",3,1,3
"Hives broke put all over ny torso. Has since gone to my thighs. Burning, stinging and itching after 1 week use. Developed severe stomach pains which resulted in regurgitating. Haven't eaten a meal in 48 hrs. The smell of food increases the nausea I feel since taking amlodipine. I have discharged this medicine. Will discuss this with the doctor who I am also discharging. She knew this med has contraindications to another med which caused the HBP. Before taking diclofenac i never had hbp. So to counter the hbp she prescribed amlodipine rather than change the sciatic nerve pain reliever. I think she is a quack whose license should be revoked.",1,1,1
So far so good. Seems I have more energy. BP down to119/72 from 195/92 See some are mad at drug company. Did drug company prescribe?? NO Talk to your doctor!!! Some meds may be different than others!!,5,5,4
"Been on 5mg for only a week, but BP has dropped dramatically from 168/97 to 119/72. I generally react to drugs very quickly as far as if they will work for me or not. So far so good with no bad side effects, but I realize I'm still new to taking it. It seems to make exercise easier too.  I feel calmer, and every little annoyance doesn't get on my nerves. My wife really likes that! I hope it continues to work the way it is.",5,5,5
Have not had an erection since I started taking it. Remain dizzy with headache. Dr. is taking me off of this at next visit or else. There has to be a substitute.,3,1,1
I am going to sue this company!! Because of this drug my husband can no longer get an erection!!! Honestly. He had no issue what so ever until he took this. He also has to take two other pills because of swelling and low potassium that this drug caused. I don't understand why the doctor doesn't switch him to something else. Has anyone else had this problem and will he be able to get an erection if he stops using this drug? ,1,1,1
"not that effective, swollen ankles",2,2,2
"I have only been on amlodipine besylate 2.5 for 1 1/2 weeks.  It was given to me to replace atenolol 25(never a problem in 15 years) because I was unable to get the latter.  I have had a headache, eyes hurt since the day after I started.  I will stop them tonight.  I take losartin in the AM with no problem. Why does no pharmacy carry atenolol anymore?",3,1,3
"Thanks to all you patient reviewers, I owe you mine. I am quitting (Norvasc) generic Amlodipine Besylate  10mg, due to ineffectiveness and severe adverse effects. Previously 10+ years ago I took Diovan, had bad reaction low BP 60/40 and passed out so I quit BP meds. Restarted 3+ years ago with Amlo which was not effective so Dr. added Irbesartan 75mg then increased to 150mg and barely got down to 140/100. I had swelling of legs and feet and joint pain for months which I mistook as a result of injury from a fall on ice. Starting this year another Dr. switched me to Losartan 100mg. I also had occasional dry cough all along so to see if made any difference he switched me a few months ago to Lisinopril 40mg and cough got worse! Switched back to Losartan as pharmacist says it is next gen drug better than Lisinopril. Ok so cough almost gone, but leg and ankle swelling and chronic pain remains. Actively changed diet and increased excercised, lost some weight and BP became normal, so 2 weeks ago Dr. agreed to cut back Amlo to 5mg and drop it if BP remains normal. Swelling and pain is reduced so planning to stop Amlo next week.  Note: All drugs have side effects, even if by a small %. No Dr. or Pharmacist or Drug maker will tell you everything you need to know. You are not just a statistic filed with the FDA. Go back to nature!",3,1,2
"I took amlodipine for nearly two years.   My legs were perpetually swollen and felt uncomfortable as well as looking unsightly.   My blood pressure seemed normal, but one day I thought of putting the cuff on my legs and the pressure was very different -- over 220.   I asked my doctor (who had been unwilling to switch drugs) if it was really a good idea to have good pressure in my arms and highly elevated pressure in my legs.   I now take Losartan:  no side effects, good blood pressure control.   I strongly suggest that anyone suffering any swelling in their legs when taking Amlodipine should check the pressure in all limbs.   Legs can be higher, but not double.",5,1,3
"Been taking amlodipine with benazepril for about 4 years. began having dizzy spells, anxiety, nervousness, feeling faint. copied the side effects and took the list to my doctor, she said to only use the benazepril, and now BP slowly creeping back up. was at a good 120-70 on this med, now 145-80, this morning 165-80.

dr started me on this for hbp. I started having dry cough and awful swelling of the legs. Went back and he cut dosage in half (from 10 to 5) and added lisinoporil.

Difficult to find a secondary to telemasartin as now diastolic is 90, sistolic 130. Adding yet another hydralizine to bring it to 130/80. Will make other lifestyle changes- swim, walk and calorie reduced diet. ",1,1,1

Now on 10 mg taken at night, which I would highly recommend as drug is strong.  My blood pressure is now running between 122 over 80 and for average 112 over seventy.  Dropping it between thirty and forty points in a couple of months I am happy but tired most of the time.  I can become dizzy easy and once in a while must lie down, but I would take the low pressure anytime.

Day 3: Severe stomach pain, nausea, violent vomiting, bloating and stabbing headache. Ended up in the ER. This medicine is horrifying if you are a person prone to side effects.",1,1,1
"I've only been taking it for just over 1 month and my blood pressure has dropped about 10 points. Still not down to perfect or steady but much improved. If I eat ""overly salty"" foods, I find I get more swelling around my ankles later on, but that only happened a couple of times. Also if I don't take them quite at the 24 hour interval, so it's less than 24 hours from my last pill, there seems to be more swelling/tightness around my ankles.",4,4,4

I had side effects.  Weakness in the legs and dizziness in the morning.  After about 3 -4 months I got a rash on my arms....  I did not do much about it until it spread to my neck and then my face.  I discontinued all other substances so I has to be this drug.  So I am discontinuing using this drug and hoping the rash goes away.  The rash got pretty bad... Very red face and puffy.  Super itchy and skin is dry looking like I have a bad sun burn almost.  Arms have the red raised areas and bumps as well.,5,1,5

I've been using this drug for over a year for hypertension that was running in the 140-150 over 88-98 range.  It seems to have lowered my BP into the 125-135 over 80-90 range. So it does what it's supposed to do but I have experienced some dizziness/light headedness and fatigue to the point where I'll be discussing with my doctor in the near future. Early on I also experienced some minor ankle swelling until I got back into a good cardio exercise program and the swelling went away almost immediately.  ,4,3,4
"I also take Atenolol 25mg twice a day, because of dizzeness I been taking Amlodipine at bed time only.  This seems to help and the combination of meds has lowered my blood pressure, I would suggest starting with 2.5 mg Amlodipine first.  This is a great med but use it with care, God Bless.",5,4,5
"not only did it not reduce my BP significantly but it produced a violent allergic facial skin condition ,first itching and red rash ,then hives [lumps ] and finally swelling all over my face resulting in a visit to A & E  and 4 weeks on steroids and many weeks of misery . There is a reference to this side effect being ""very rare"" but I wonder how rare it really is --manufacturers rely  on patients to report side effects , but when they are as extreme as this many people would wish to have nothing  more to do with the drug  or its maker -that is my reaction . The main problem with an allergic reaction of this sort is that it it is not immediately apparent what is causing it  ,particularly if you are taking other drugs . Also there are many other substances that can cause allergic  reactions and even a consultant dermatologist may not look at a mainstream drug as an obvious candidate when there be any number of environmental or food factors  involved .Only by a long and exhaustive elimination process was amlodipine identified as the villain in my  case --stopping taking it while continuing the steroids  cured it completely ,but as soon as I started again [still taking the steroids ] back it came and the steroids could do nothing to stop it . I think more research needs to be done on this --the swelling and hives if they progress inwards around the face can lead to serious complications.",3,1,1
"I have been taking it for 5-10 years. At first, it caused ankle swelling. That went away with time. It still causes some fatigue. But BP went from 150/100 to 120/70.

It took me 18 years to feel better, don't let it happen to you. If you have a reaction get to your doctor. I thought it was my allergies and asthma when it was really my blood pressure medicine.

"After repeated bp systolic readings over 200, I was started on this med in December 2013, and am still on it. I have also been on 2 other classes of blood pressure meds for years.

As of now, my systolic bp is still high with frequent readings in the 170's.  What I specifically want to address is that the side effects of this medication has had a devastating effect on my carefully balanced pain management.   The swelling of the hands and feet has brought on almost constant pain in my wrists and hands.  Sleep is always an issue with fibromyalgia, and this drug only adds to those issues; I also certainly did not need help with my depression.  I am so tired and in so much pain.  After appointments with my family practitioner and my rheumatologist this week, they are working together to on how to satisfactorily manage both my bp and my pain level.

"I have been taking a 5mg daily dose of this med for about 7 months. At first it worked fine but recently I have developed a chronic cough, congestion in sinuses, sinus drip and heart palpitations. These symptoms seem to be common for this drug. Along with this drug I also take a daily 12.5mg dose of HCTZ. I believe the Amlodipine is causing the problem because I had been on HCTZ for a number of years. I am going to stop taking this drug for a few days to see if the symptoms clear up.",3,1,2

After 4 months have suddenly developed severe muscle pain in upper arms, shoulders and thighs, with very restricted movement.

Pain killers - Piroxicam and Paracetamol which I have found effective previously, have not reduced the pain significantly. ",4,1,2
"The pill was easy to swallow, but it did not lower my BP near normal.  After taking 11 days,  I suffered terrible muscle pain all over my body, to the extent that I could not get out of bed. My muscles burned as though I had been doing an extremely strenuous workout for hours.  I had to take 800 mg of Advil every 5-6 hours to even function.  The pain only mostly subsided after I had been off the Amlodipine for 10 days, but my BP was extremely high and I took the pill again and within 3 days I was in extreme pain. ",3,1,2

Must take deep breaths for a minute or two, then I'm okay.  No real side affects noticed except very foul urine stench, and being 'bound"" up.  I've forced myself to drink more fluids to flush the med. and found 1 to 2 cups of hot tea, 2000mg vit C, 1000mg vit. E further helped to reduce ""foul"" urine stench.  Added more dark leafy veg's. to keep looser.  Other than that, it is easy to take, 1 pill in the am.  Hopes this helps some reading this.",3,4,4

"initially put on high dose (10)mg to bring down HBP resulted in coming down too low and had LBP after visit to the Emergency Room. Best to have a cardiologist do the fine tuning on BP meds and not leave to a GP. Felt it was working well in conjunction with Benezepril med and dissipating some of my mild stroke symptoms. Doing hese meds in conjunction with largely fruits and veges diet, weight loss and 30 minutes per day brisk walk on treadmill...",4,3,4
I have been taking this medicine for 2 years and over the past year I had lots of problems with swelling in my legs & a rash. I was given creams and Bactrim for the rash but it continued to get worse. I was given Lasix & potassium for the swelling but it continued so after stress tests & an echocardiogram & a ultrasound for blood clots which all came back negative...My Dr. increased the Lasix & potassium to the point my blood pressure bottomed out & I felt horrible so I quit taking all of these but I continued my Cozaar until I went back to my Dr. today. My rash is clearing up and my swelling has went down so now my doctor tells me that this drug may have caused all my problems. I wonder how long he would have taken to figure this out if I hadn't quit this drug by myself? ,3,1,3
I have had gum surgery (gingivectomy surgery) and will have the third surgery due to this calcium channel blocker.  It worked great for the blood pressure but not for the gums.

"Hello all. I hope everyone is enjoying great health. This is an update as to the commenhts I made about Amlodipine on 4/19/12 under the name ""The Truth"". I had, on 4/19/12, complained that the amlodipine, which I'd taken for at least 2 yrs, wasn't working. I complained that my BP hadn't marginally improved, and that the medication caused bloating. Well, my Dr, at my request, put me back on Metoprolol (50mgs)beginning on 6/7/12. To date, I've lost 17 lbs, the bloating has disappeared, and, most important of all, my BP has has lowered significantly. I feel SO MUCH BETTER! Best of luck to all of you for continued good health!

Though I have had them throughout most of my life, I have suffered severe daily, debilitating migraines for a year straight now with absolutely no relief from the pain, as well as any or all of the other symptoms that come along with my migraines. Every medicine that I've tried has not helped, the strongest pain medicine only taking the edge off & allowing me an hour or 2 of sleep, If I was lucky. It has been just about 2 months since I started on this & my doctor & I have decided to try removing some of the others, beginning with Topiramate/Topimax & then we will try taking me off some of the pain medicine & I am hoping to not have to use anything other than my Immitrex nasal spray, but my insurance only covers 6 (20mg) per month. I was told that I may have to have my dosage of Amplodipine raised soon but I am on a very low dose & it is apparently not given often for migraines.

Going to start on more exercise.  Then maybe I can stop any of these BP meds.  They all have roughly the same side effects.  Years ago, when first diagnosed with HBP, was taking Tenorhetic.

Didnt seem to think it is meds since I told her that I had been taking acai berry concentrate in my water daily.  After reading this post, I know it is the meds--because I was taking acai berry before medication with no problems.  Anyway, I will refrain from both.  I have tried two other medications--experienced uncomfortable side effects.  Oh yeah, also have weight gain and stomach bloating.  I hope to find a natural alternative.

"Started 1 month ago on 10mg Amlodipine, 10 mg Lisinopril, and 25mg hydrochlorothiazide daily for scary high BP. My pressure came down quickly BUT the side effects have been troublesome. Fatigue (especially in the afternoon), weakness, dizziness, hair loss (about 3 times the normal amount of hair in my shower-yikes!), loss of appetite, weirdly cold fingers at times, slight ankle swelling, and low blood pressure. I almost blacked out while driving when I took a deep breath and held it to get rid of a bout of hiccups!   I have recently scaled back on my dosages to 5mg of each BP medication daily and my blood pressure so far has been fine with the lower doses. My side effects are much less with the lower doses and I am feeling almost normal.  I am taking 1200mg garlic daily since I have read it can help lower blood pressure. I am wearing compression stockings during the day to help keep ankle swelling down. I have lost almost 10 lbs since beginning treatment for my BP, I suspect because the meds have killed my appetite.   My goal is through weight and diet management to be able to get off the medications completely. I'm still about 20 lbs too heavy so I'm working to lose the extra lbs. Hopefully that will normalize my BP and allow me to be medication free. Wish me luck!  ",4,2,4

I finally decided maybe it was the amlodipine,  remembering back to the timing of when I began taking it and when the headaches started. So, I was anxious to look at this site and read others experiences with this drug. I want to thank everyone for sharing.  It is so helpful to know I am not the only one having these awful headaches. I am also having some bladder problems  which I had not associated with this medicine before reading the reviews.  I will stop this medicine tomorrow, maybe I can get my life back.  ",5,1,3

Then, a couple of weeks ago, having developed an upper respiratore infection, the blood pressure was up, and the dr. prescribed another does per day of this which made it 5 mgs. in the morning and 5 mgs. at night.  My legs got much worse, ankles were swollen, behind knee was swollen, eyes were puffy, and bad headaches.

I looked up this medication on google and there were all the side effects.  I stopped taking it immediately.  Back to my old peppy self and no more headaches.  I will never take this drug again.

After Amlodipine was added, the side effects included a “boiling soup” sound and sensation in my stomach, alternating constipation and diarrhea, tarry stools, stinging, burning and pain going to the bathroom, weird sensation in mouth in morning, hot flashes and sweats, flushing, irregular heartbeat, etc.  After enduring the side effects for too long,  a cardiologist eliminated the Amlodipine. The side effects were gone within days, except for the stinging and burning going to the bathroom.  Six months after the Amlodipine was stopped,  an endoscopy showed a healing ulcer in my stomach.

I never felt good and sometimes had palpitations after taking it. I weaned myself off of it and refuse to take it. Wish doctors understood how hard it is dealing with side effects.

I am extremely dizzy and can't bend over to put the clothes in the dryer. When I cough I get dizzy and almost fall over. I've also gained at least 25 pounds since I started taking this pill and I bruise extremely easily. My arms hurt so badly I asked my husband to massage them and now I look like I've been beaten! The FDA must re-evaluate this medication because of the excessive amount of side effects. I'd rather have the high blood pressure than the terrible side-effects of this pill. ,2,1,2

Considerable swelling of ankles and feet are the biggest concern now. Sometimes I feel bloated, like I'm retaining fluid. I urinate almost every hour all night long. Tough to get a good nights rest. My sex drive is almost zero. (yes there is sex after sixty :) Oh, and my ears itch. Strange, but true. My blood pressure is still good (115-120 over 75) But I know I have gained at least 10-15 lbs of water weight. Is there a diuretic pill that can be taken with this drug to counteract the fluid retention? I feel like a water balloon!",5,2,5

While easy to use, it's one of those meds you can't just stop taking when you don't like it, you have to be weened off, I'm not comfortable with that. I have found several natural remedies that I will be switching to as soon as my doctor gets me off this crap. ",4,1,3
"I switched from Lisinopril 20 mg. to 2.5 mg of Amlodipine. Blood pressure stays around 110/78. Also taking HCTZ, so no swelling noticed in legs & feet, although I am gaining weight. I got very ill after drinking a daily ounce of pomegranate juice with my medication: severely low BP (at lowest point, 79/58), dizziness and shortness of breath.  I drank pom juice with meds for 3 days and the effect has been like an overdose. DO NOT DRINK POMEGRANATE JUICE WITH AMLODIPINE!  It is like grapefruit juice and can be toxic!   It has been 6 days since I have been off my meds and my BP is staying low (109/77) and still dizzy.  I can't walk for long periods of time and have to stop for a few minutes to catch my breath and control the dizziness.  Hoping that the effects will dissipate soon and I can get back to normal.  I am drinking cranberry juice to help detox my liver and kidneys.  It seems to be helping, but I had like 15 days worth of meds in my body.  ",3,3,4
"Started on 5mg but was not effective.  Dr. Increased to 10mg & it brought it down to normal to boarderline range but I am not convinced my BP is as low as it should be.

No real pain/itching/rashes to mention, I do have dry mouth & urinate a couple times a night (but this was occurring before the med), no erection or sexual performance problems either.",5,3,3
"I have been on this medication for over a year.  It has helped lower my blood pressure, along with another med for high b.p. Unfortunately, it is beginning to cause my ankles and feet to swell.  This also is a side effect of the other blood pressure medicine.",3,2,3

This medication causes swelling in my legs and ankles.   I was so afraid I stopped taking it after a week. This medication is a poor substitute for Felodipine ER 10 mg.  There should be warning listed on the medication.,1,1,1
since i took this medication it has lowered my high blood pressure. ,3,3,3
I have not taken this med yet. I was on lisinopril for 3 days and made me VERY sick. Stopped taking it and was fine the very next day. The doctor put me on this today and after reading reviews decided not to take it. The thing is that I went to the doctor for a rash on my leg and they never even adressed that now they have me taking all kinds of tests and taking meds for high blood pressure. How do they know I have high blood pressure if it was the first time they have taken my pressure. You cant make that judgement by one time. Time to find a new doctor. By the sounds of things I think the doctors are getting a kickback for prescribing this med. Well they are not getting my $$$.,1,1,1
"I have been on this medication for some time in addition to taking Diovan HCT 320/12.5 which is a combination blood pressure and water pill. I would take the Amlodipine 10mg in the evening and the other in the AM hours. I too had attributed my aches and pains etc. to getting older, however after reading all 274 Reviews I believe this medication is responsible for most of my problems.. No sex drive, weight gain, crazy dreams that make no sense at all, swollen feet/ankles and legs, feeling that my throat was narrowing, making it noticable to swallow, dry itchy skin, pain in my left shoulder and neck, getting up 2-3 times during the night to tinkle,inability to get to sleep or sleeping for 4-6 hrs a night,thinning hair, dry eyes and mouth, heart palpations which caused my cardiologist to feel that I needed a pacemaker, which I have had now for one year.(Wonder if I really needed that). Since I didn't have any of these problems before,.. like I said I attributed it to aging. What brought this medication to my attention?.. I ran out and needed a new prescription, using a military mail order firm, new scripts take 10-14 days to fill... after about 5 days without it I noticed that I had dropped 1 1/2 lbs and now a week later I have lost 7 lbs.. I had gained about 40 lbs over the past 5 years and was miserable, tried exercising, diet etc.with no results or non lasting weight loss.I received my refill yesterday and I think that I am not going to take it and see just what happens. The pain in my shoulder is easing up, no more hip and back pain, (I have had both hip joint replaced, but the muscles around them hurt),the night sweats in the neck/upper chest area have diminished, my dreams have some sequence,no pain in my legs, still waiting for the libido to come back(yes there is sex after 70:-), Still get up during the night to tinkle.. hopefully that will ease up too. I'll keep you guys posted.I hope everything gets better for everyone.  I'm starting to feel Gr-r-r-eat!! ",5,2,2

Went to the Dr. felt like I was going to explode.  Have to go see a specialist.  Ultra sound found my abdomen is filled with water.  Nose bleeds as well.  Horrible.  May have done significant damage to my body.  Do not recommend at all!,3,1,1
makes me feel sad. ,5,2,3
Eye twitching,5,4,4
I just started it today.,5,3,3
Started on 5mg. There was little change.  The Dr. increased to 10mg. My legs and ankles swelled and became blotchy.  Dr. prescribed water pill. Swelling continued to increase and a fevered redness spread over ankles. The Dr. than prescribe an antibiotic to help infection and stop the HP prescription. The infection got worst in three days and I had to go to ER. I was in hospital for 6 days. I do not have diabetes or poor circulation. For me this was not the drug. I can't recommend.,4,1,1
I have been taking this drug for a year now. only side effect for me is slight dizzyness.,5,4,5
  When I had a severe alergic reaction to Lisinopril my doctor switched me to this medication.  It in conjunction with Clonidine has done me very well.  Although I have had very bad swelling in my feet and ankles after taking this.  My doctor added Furosemide (Lasix) and it has helped considerably.,5,5,5
"I was taking lisinpril for over 10 years, when I started experiencing a dry cough(which I believed to be my asthma).  Dr. insisted it was my lisinpril and switched me to amlodipine.  I have been taking it for 6 weeks now.  Cough stayed(no surprise) but now I have swollen ankles, feet, dry month, excessive thrist, and am up every 2 hours during the night going to the bathroom along with the cough. Dr. hasn't taken my blood pressure since he switched my meds.  Maybe time for a new DR.",4,2,3
I have been using amlodipine to steady my heart and lower my blood pressure. I have heart disease for 20 years....this medicine makes my saliva bitter that makes all foods taste terrible. I suck on Halls menthol cough drops.,2,2,4

IT WAS EFFECTIVE BUT I WAS TAKING IT IREGULARLY,5,3,4
GOOD,5,5,5
Dr. stated I had pre hypertension. Put me on Lisinopril but stopped taking it after constantly coughing day and night. Switched to Amlodipine Besylate 5mg one a day and now have red blotches over both arms and legs with cripling pain in back and arms that appeared after two weeks on Amlodipine. Went to my Dr. but had to be seen by a Nurse Practicioner who stated it was not a side effect of the medicine. Was all of this just a coincidence? I thinking of stopping the Amlodipine myself to see if it all clears up. (or change Drs),5,1,1
it doesn't cure the pulpatation,4,2,3
have been on several bp meds nothing worked for me doctor put me on  amlodipine 5 mg didn't work increased it to 10 mg works great bp never looked better no side effects at all am overall satisfied with this med.,5,5,5

I thought I was the only one with these side effects.  But after reading others problem with the drug, I am going to discontinue using immediately.  Thanks everyone for the information.  We all have to stick together. ",1,1,1
"Amlodipine 5mg is poison for me. I stopped taking it after a month because of the following symptoms: severe flu-like pains with aches in my limbs,nausea with dry heaving, feeling like I got run over by a bus, trembling, endless hot flashing. My doctor said that these sysmptoms are not from Amlodipine but after reading all the comments I beg to differ.   Two days after I stopped using it I still feel bad but not as bad. The nausea is finally subsiding.This stuff is not for me. I would rather have high BP and then live in misery. Way to go Pfizer.",1,1,1
"Yesterday, I reported all was fine after 6 days.  I was wrong.  Last night I experienced some pain in rt side of my heart and immediate indigestion on rt side, further below the heart.

"I have been using this medication for almost a year now.  I developed serious side effect on the drug - hives, hot rashes in between filings.  But after talking to the pharmacist and switched between a couple other manufacturers, I was able to settle on one of them.  If you are experiencing the same problem, you should have your pharmacy switch the manufacturer to see if it helps.  It takes me a couple month to find the right one.",4,3,3
"I'm writing this because of my mother's problems with it. She had it in the past and was taken off due to bad side effects, then was on it again in Azor, and  now is on it alone again. She just went through a spell where she almost completely lost control of her mind. She could not do simple tasks. Her memory was all over the place and she'd get her mind on one thing and not be able to let it go and her worrying was through the roof. Now that she's on norvasc alone, she's sliding again. She is having to urinate frequently, especially at night, so she loses sleep, plus insomnia is a side effect, so the combination is taking her health down. Her doc tried to convince me it was old age. Sheesh! She has many other side effects listed for it as well. ",4,1,3
"Dr prescribed it, I take it, no problems.",5,5,5
"Being on this drug for about 1 month and checking my bp every day, I find that my upper pressure is high (146) and my lower pressure is better (75).  Shouldn't the upper number be lower?  I really don't think the drug is working correctly.",4,2,3

I just started this medication about a week ago.. After reading all of your comments about weight gain.. and leg pain I am considering stopping the meds myself. I am experiencing leg pains and a dizziness that is crazy. I feel high as a kite for hours. I have not seen any swelling but I feel so tired. I didnt take these pills for one whole day and I feel much better without them. I have not been testing my blood pressure at home but I can feel when it goes up and down. I too have had crazy psychotic dreams off and on. It was scary. Taking the pills at bedtime helps u sleep through the  side effects if u take it earlier enough. Oh yeah and I too have night sweats. I dont trust medications AT ALL.. and this one I am not sure I am sticking with either..,1,1,3
tiredness,5,4,4

"Doc replaced Lusinapril with this, after 3 months, BP is a little bit lower, have had neck swelling, and itching, chest pains, wild dreams (dont mind them too much yet), loss of sex drive and cant really find out what symptoms to expect. Thought I was having a stroke or something one time.  Im going to change when I take the pill, 5MG, mabe it is too much.  Have leg pain and I have gained at least 10 LBS since starting.  Eat right and work hard every day.  Bp fluctuates frequently and wake up with fast heart beat and soaking wet frequently.  Can any one tell me if there is a better med?  I just dont feel good sometimes.",4,2,2
Toss into hypertension because of surgical menopause.  Never had it before.  Took this med which did not work.  Made a mistake and had grapefruit with it and I felt like I was going to have a stroke.  The maker of this med did not mention that grapefruit should not be eaten with it.,3,1,1

Lowered my Blood pressure also I was able to get an erection!,4,4,4
Treatment is effective but causes foot swelling. I find that my dose needs to be smaller than the current smallest provided dose allows(5mg)so cut about 1mg off a tablet,4,3,4
Had to increse the dose to 2.5 and increase weight gain immediately. Going to bathroom several times at night and through the day.  does anyone else have these problems? ,2,2,2
"Note to ""Not Feeling Well:"" My advice is get a new Dr. before this one kills you with over medication! Lisinopril is the culprit for your coughing as told to me by a pharmacist. Please, for your own good, get a second opinion.  After coughing my head off due to Lisinopril I changed to Amlopidine 5mg. two years ago. Fortunately, no side effects and bp in normal range most of the time. I research all drugs that my new doctor prescribes and so far most of them have too many side effects to even consider taking them. It's still my body and ultimately, I'm the only one responsible for its condition.  Why do drug salesmen give free samples to doctors? Think about it.",5,4,4
But am having trouble with the gerneric  norvasc. I want to know if there is corn used as a filler in the pill. I;m very allgeric  to corn.

Lisinopril made me cough; a diuretic didn't work.  Amlodipine was just the ticket.  I had a slight swelling of the ankles initally but since I've cut way back on  bread and other starches the swelling has disappeared. My moods have leveled off also.,5,5,5
"I have been on this drug for abt 2 months. It seems to be effective in lowering my bp, but my biggest concern is excessive thirst throughout the day and getting up every 2 hours at night to urinate. Also have experienced wacky dreams most nights. The past 2 weeks my ankles are swollen at end of day and have red blotches on them. I also have more problem with lower back pain.",5,4,5

It has lowered the blood pressure but I am having severe hot flashes, fat legs, ringing in my ears and fatigue.  I am considering stopping the medication.  I went through the hot flashes with menopause, and before I took this med I had none.  Now they are back.  I exercise everyday, eat right, and have always had to work to keep my weight down, and I am very uphappy that this medication is working against me.

However, despite no decreased sex drive, I am having problems getting and keeping an erection.  I don't know if it is this drug, or the lisinopril, or the combination of both.  Doctor says neither, but I disagree.  Anyone else with same problems?",5,1,4
"My Doctor first started with 10mg of Bisoproplol,20mg of Lisinopril and 10mg of hctz.

Last 2 months increased dosage to 5 mg 2xday which immediately decreased my chronic angina without decreasing my BP.  My BP runs low normally and never had high BP.   With increased dosage have noticed  numbness in lips/gum tenderness and these discomforts are increasing.  May return to 1xday to verify reactions caused by increase in amlodipine and then decide if the benefit of less chronic angina is  worth the lip numbness/tender gums.  Will consult with cardiologist/PA.  Also taking metoprolol and ranexa for angina along with aspirin, plavix, pravastatin, zoloft, stool softner, alprazolam, temazepam, multivitamin and iron supplement.      ",5,5,5

My doc says there's nothing in the drug that I can be allergic to (I'm allergic to sulfa), but can't I be allergic to the drug itself?  I stopped taking it, but the hives haven't subsided.  Wonder how long it takes to get out of your system?",3,1,3
"My doc put me on Amlodipine after HCTZ gave me hives and Lisinopril/HCTZ gave me a cough.  It may be working for my BP, but I am once again covered with hives.

I also reported tingling/numbness of the feet (neuropathy) and again, no mention to me that this medication was causing the problems.  The same with severe lower-back pain when walking or moderate exercise.  I was sent to a vascular surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, and more--but not one of the doctors indicated all my problems might be related to amlodipine. I cut my pills in half, and began to see a marked, though not total, lessening of the problems.  However I'm sure the doctors would object.",5,1,3

I only use this drug after taking 20 mg of Ramipril and my BP is still high.  I took it last night and had very bad dreams.  I'm wondering if this is a side effect of the med.  I know that stress and what we eat has a lot to do with our BP levels.  Fatty and salty foods tend to cause my BP to jump.  Stress is my worst enemy.  Wish I knew how to get the stress down.  Tried everything.  I keep Amlodipine with me at all times.  I've tried several other meds that had bad side effects.  This site allows us to share info like this.  Thank you WebMD.,4,4,4

Presently changed to a new medication within the group of ACE inhibitors called Benazepril at 20mgs plus the same diuretic. OK, back to Amlodipine: It does lower your bp but in my case with several side efects such as Lightheadedness, swollen ankles low libido and very poor tolerance for alcohol, those still persist, however some of the initial side efects such as insomnia, constipation and skin rashes were gone after the first week of use. Overall and effective med. to lower your blood pressure. Bottom line: I'm happier with Benazepril 20mgs with less side effects and a remarkable drop in blood pressure not even close to what I was able to achieve with Amlodipine.",5,3,3
Increase Urination especially at night. I have been on it for about a month now. Was taken off of Norvasc (been on this drug for ten years) because of ankle swelling.  I renamed Amalodipine/Benzanate...I'm a lone a peeing!,5,2,3

I will stay on it for a little bit longer to see if it actually works for me or I need a higher strength.  One thing I did see improvement is the side effects of hives.  I do not get the hives as frequent or as serveve, but it still exist.  (I have a full panel of blood tests for allegies, but ruled out all of them).   Other side effects are the same as Sular, such as dizziness, headache, lack of concentration at work, tired, having hard time falling to sleep, sudden fast heart beats, etc.  Overall, I did not find it to be very effective.",3,2,2

I went to the doctor, to check out my prostate, so I know that it is the medicine. I don't want to take the medicine, because it makes me urinate to much. Please give me some insight on what I might be able to due, with regards to the urinating problem I am experiencing. ",5,2,4

"Started on 5mg and cardio Dr. upped to 10mg a month ago.  Now I have swollen ankles and feet, leg cramps but has helped control BP.  Called Doc and he said take half of pill for two weeks.  I take it with diuretic.  Would rather try something else.",4,2,3

"I started using 5mg of Amlodipine once at night for the last month. The cardiologist decided to add this drug to the current Benicar Hct 40/25mg that I was taking once daily for a year to lower my BP some more. The first thing I noticed were the side effects listed for this drug: fatigue, lack of motivation, dizzyness and mental fog, and constipation. It does lower my BP, but I feel way too laid back to be productive at all. Last week an unusual tenderness and fluid buildup appeared on my left forearm. The next day it moved to my elbow and has caused my elbow to be tender and swollen. I will be calling the cardiologist to get off of the Amlodipine. I wish there was a drug out there that was good for you and actually made you feel good too! If you are sexually active or want to be, do not take this drug!",5,1,3
"I have been on 10 mg of Amlodipine for 8 days and my face is flushed, my ears are hot and I feel very anxious. I have a call in to my doctor,I'm going to ask to be taken off this med and given something else.",5,1,1

I now notice that my ankles are swelling and my skin itches, feels like its streching and my inner wrist itches also.  I thougt maybe it was the weather or something I ate or an allergy. Well after reading all the comments I think its the AMLODIPINE. Ive already tried 2 other BP medicine and don't want to change again but I'm uncomfortable specially with the swelling.  I will call my doctor tomorrow.",5,2,3
"Oh boy this one almost put me over the edge! I ached all over, was dizzy, nauseous, wanted to stay in bed all day, legs swelled and itched so badly that I scratched oozing sores in them.  Even my scalp itched terribly and oozed when I HAD to scratch.  I was so tired and depressed, at 74, thought I was just old.  My boys came to visit and asked what was wrong.  I said I'm just getting old and they said ""NO! get to the doctor!""  I quit taking it that day and began to feel better by the next day!  BP went up but so did my morale!!! Now on new drug.  Hope it works - couldn't be any worse!!  Life is good again!!!",3,1,1
"I have been taking this w/quinipril for about a 9 months. My ankles started hurting but a foot doc told me it was nothing. So I just lived with it until about 1-2 months ago I started getting some big swelling in my feet especially my left. Finally got into my doc today and he told me he was 95% sure it was because of this drug, so he took me off of it. I guess we will see in a few days.",5,1,5

"I've taken AMLODIPINE 5mg for two months and I also take HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 25mg. This is the 3rd time my medication was changed and it seems to work for me.  AMLODIPINE I take it late at night when I go to bed and snack on crackers before taking it so it won't bother my stomach. HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE I do not take it at night because it wakes me up 2 or 3 times to urinate, so I take it in the morning. My blood pressure was 179/92 for the last two months its been pretty steady at 135/80. Hopefully it will go down more. The only side effects I experience is drowsiness with AMLODIPINE. ",5,4,4
"I was taking 100mg Atenolol but my BP was still elevated.  Dr. added Amlodipine.  BP is down, the last couple of weeks, I've had swelling in legs/ankles/feet.  Dr. told me this would happen but didn't say how long it would last.  Does anyone have any idea how long it will last?  ",4,3,3
"Doctor put me on Amlodipine 2.5 after  allergic reactions to beta blockers and Lisinopril over 10 mg occured It seemed to work at first,then a rash developed on face,neck,back,legs headache too. FRUSTRATING!!!!!",2,1,1
"Dr. switched me off of benezepril to avoid incipient kidney problems (no technical explanation) to amlodipine 5 mg.  Daily, usually take at around midnight before sleep. My BP is lowered, and I have far fewer side effects than with previous meds but do have irregular sleep, mild nausea, some weakness in legs, and mild constipation on an irregular basis. This round of medication is the first in my life (age 71) and I don't know enough about side effects to worry over these symptoms.  Went 4 days and nights during travel without the meds (forgot to pack 'em) and felt great the whole trip.  Got back, resumed once daily intake, now have leg weakness, stomach upset, irregular sleep, and heavy eye mattering again.  None of those is fatal I guess, but there is discomfort when using amlodipine. I'm hoping to be off all meds altogether after a year's use of BP med, and first time ever watching dietary content.  It's disturbing and not in my lifestyle pattern to take anything.",5,2,4
"I haven't taken for one full month yet. It has lowered my B/P; I take 5MG, generic Amlodipine. Woke up with what looks like ""heat rash"". First on inner wrists, arms, then on to chest, abdomin, back, neck and spots over eye, behind ears. This rash is slightly raised, hot & itchy. Bendryl helped temporarily yet rash came back full force. Oatmeal bath did not help. I am irritated that Amlodipine seemed to help initially, now is rashy and I had to stop Lisinopril after BAD dizziness.  There has got to be a better way!! I'm gonna try the Hawthorne berries/Cayenne combo that a previous person mentioned.",5,1,3
"Since starting this med I have severe hot flashes and very bright red face, a hundred times in 24 hours. Also libido has dropped through the floor.",5,1,4

My blood pressure is not as low as I would like (132/68), and I really must get off of it and try something else. Cozaar had no side effects for me.  ",3,1,3

I have been on this drug approximately one month and in the past week experienced swelling in the ankles and hot red blotchy areas on the face after the first hour of taking the pill (usually first thing in the AM).  The redness disappears later in the day.  Dr. does NOT think ankle swelling is from the drug and I beg to differ because never have I had swelling in the enkles - just seems likely that when a person starts taking a different drug and experience symptoms not evident previously - then DAH! This is not rocket science to equate new drug with never before afflictions!  I prefer NOT to take any drugs.  I am going to half the 10 mg. dosage and see if that helps or go off altogether.,4,2,3

"My Husband has been taking Amlodipine 5mg, then 10mg for 2 years now.  I have watched my husbands health deteriorate and I blame it on this drug, and the dr who prescribed it and told him he would have to take it for the rest of his life.  3 visits to the drs office his bp was elevated, and he told him that he needed to go back on meds.  He didn't ask what was going on in his life or how he was feeling he just wrote the script and walked out.  My husband's demeanor changed for the worse, his libido is nil.  He sweats profusely and has gained 40 lbs in these 2 years and has added stomach problems to his laundry list of symptoms.  Istead of taking the meds away they add more.  His BP has been normal since he started taking the pills, it just goes up when he stresses out about having to go to the dr.  His legs are going bad and he has sciatica.  I believe that if they would take him off that Amlodipine he could get his health back.",4,1,2

My new doctor advised me to switch to this drug after assessing my condition (43, F, semi-vegetarian, smoker, occasional drinker, exercise present in job). First 2 weeks into it were terrible - chest pains, racing heartbeat, neck stiffness and body pains. After that, everything went okay. From an average BP reading of 150-160/105-115 a day, it's now down to 125-130/85-90. My dose is only 5mg/day which I take every 8am. Quite effective, I think so. ",5,3,4

I've lost about 2 inches on my boner and I am no longer stiff as a board. It also takes a lot more for me to get an erection when normally I look at my wife and I'm standing at attention. This is very disappointing to me as I am still very sexually active. My wife says she doesn't notice a difference but I sure do.,5,2,5
Blood Pressure was not responding to my old medications and we switched to this combo.  Blood pressure was down from 160 to 115-120 in a matter to days.  Blood pressure is right where we wanted it to be for my age.  Very pleased with the results. ,5,5,5
"Have been on meds for hypertension for over 40 years. have taken many kinds. Was on amlodipine alone and no longer worked; went to higher dose but had lots of swelling on my feet. Switched to this and blood pressure dropped, no more swelling. No diuretic needed any more. Awesome!",5,5,5
Been on drug since 1992 (25 Yrs.). Very satisfied. Works perfectly for me. ,5,5,5
Blood pressure went down literally overnight from 170 to 120,5,5,5

feel a little light headed after taking it but i lay down it goes away make sure you eat with it it helps,5,5,5
"I took 5 mg at night.  Within two days I was feeling ""off"", not dizzy, but not totally together.  The longer I was on it the worse the symptoms got.  I had to pay attention to where I was placing my feet or I would get off kilter (indoors on flat floors), be careful going down stairs.  I would bump into walls.  My gain widened for balance.  I was vaguely nauseous.  I finally had to tell my doctor I needed to stop taking it when I was coming up concrete porch steps and lost my balance luckily grabbing the railing and not falling backwards.  As for my Blood Pressure it was great! But I wasn't willing to risk a fractured hip or skull.",4,1,5
BY USING amlodipine besilate (lodopine 10 mg) swalloing on lower parts legs (pindli) has occured. pl advise. Regards,5,5,5
may I use this drug for blood pressure/heart as I am out of Metoprolol ,5,5,5
this is poison to you,1,1,1
"My systolic was jumping over 200 while on daily doses of Lisinopril HTC 20/25, Linsinopril 20mg and Atenolol 25 mg.  My Dr. added Amlodipine 10 mg.   I hated the way it made me feel from the beginning, but at about the 8-week mark I told my Dr. that it was exacerbating almost every Fibromyalgia symptom I had.  Given it was a time of year when the weather was tough with fibro, we agreed I'd stay on it longer.  Around 4 months I began to notice some edema in my ankle. At 5 months I developed so much pain in my hands that I virtually couldn't use them.  My rheumatologist and family doctor consulted back and forth for a month--meanwhile my BP had still been running high 170's/90's. Finally the Amlodipine was reduced by half. After 1 week on the reduced dose, I was not having any reduction of the pain in my hands, so I called my doctor and told her that I refused to take the Amlodopine any longer.  After another 10 days off it, my hands were still very painful.   At the present time, I am on prednisone, but have not been able to taper that out to the lowest dose before discontinuing it. To be clear: For me, the Amlodipine caused a build-up of fluid in every joint of my hands and wrists; that felt like my hands were going to explode.  The visible edema was not significant, but that wasn't what every joint was telling me. I hope that my experience is very uncommon, and not applicable to you!     ",2,1,1
It makes my face turn very red and I do not like that.....is there another drug that does not have these side effects and is both effective?,5,5,5
"My doctor switched me from Amlodipine to Amlodipine-Benazepril. Was okay for 2 weeks then since feel tired all the time, dizzy, ear ringing, pressure in my head, feet ankles swelling, constantly urinating all night, neck and back bones sore, went to a chiropractor thinking I threw them both out. Has to be this drug. Going back to just Amlodipine as I was doing okay with it. ",5,1,3
"The medication I had been taking was removed from my RX formulary and this was substituted 5mg. After monitoring my BP for two weeks it was marginally better, never below 135/70 and most of the time over 145/80. I am fatigued from the minute I wake up til bed time. I don't know if it'd the amlodipine or not but I would like my blood pressure better controlled.  ",2,2,2
"My doctor put me back on this drug after a bout of super high blood pressure. I had taken it in the past, along with carvedilol and pressure closer to normal. However, now I remember why I stopped taking it in the past..Its only been a few days and already I am breathless, dizzy, and can barely get out of my own way, not to mention the return of an erratic heartbeat..Like the way it works, but have to stop taking. Will see dr. next week to get something different.",1,1,4

"I was taking this for 4 months and it was horrible, terrible cough which would make me gag and throw up, Dr took me off this and it took about 8 or 9 days before I stopped coughting, I feel sooo much better after I stopped taking  it. If you have these problems please have the Dr change it and you will feel so much better.",3,1,3
This did help to lower my B/P but the side effect of coughing and throwing up was not worth it. Went to DR today told me to stop taking he prescribed something else but said it could take up to one month to get it out of my system. It is going to be a long couple of weeks.,4,1,4
"Began to bruise easily, and got thin-skin.  Bruising of forearms so significant that blood would leach out of skin.  Stopped taking & problem is almost totally gone.  Other issues like severe leg and hand cramps when working.  Skin tore very easy. ",5,2,5

"I have been taking this medication for a number of years without problems but in the last 4 months I have been experiencing pretty annoying dizziness; I have been through 3 MRI's and 2 MRA's, all have had normal results. I am now concerned that this medication could be the cause.",4,4,4
"This Med was keeping my BP down in normal range. Now that I am losing weight and swimming 5 x a week, I am experiencing low than usual blood pressure numbers, like 109/65 and 107/62 and 106/64 Is this too low? I am seeing my doctor mid-June 2012. Sometimes I feel dizzy and faint when it is low. ",5,5,5
Took 5-20 2 x's daily for five years with great results.  Insurance switched me to 10-40 1 x per day and I have a marked increase in BP from 128/70 to 160/82 on average. Now have ringing ears and rapid heart beat. Going to see the Doc for a change. ,5,3,4
Effectively lowered my BP but after a month am starting to notice vision changes.  Will be talking to Dr. about this today.   ,5,4,5
it's changed my life,5,5,5
"Doctor prescribed amlodipine in conjunction w/ lisinopril, since lisinopril by itself wasn't lowering BP .  Both keep my BP down, especially after exercising.  Didn't seem to have any side effects; other than initially getting lite-headed after standing up too fast; libido is normal.  I don't really follow HBP diet guidelines.",4,4,4
Pressure still at the high end (179/83). Also using atenolol.,5,4,3
I was taking amlodipine besylate for some time when I finally realized that the swelling in my feet and ankles might be due to that.  I had my doctor change to another med and immediately the swelling stopped and I have no longer had that problem.  My husband takes it and it does NOT cause him any swelling.  ,5,1,1

"I am currently taking amLODiPine Besylate along with .81mg aspirin and a  diuretic for swelling of my legs. From the beginning I have suffered from insomnia only getting 4 to 5 hours of sleep at night. The doctor then prescribed .5mg daily of Ambiem. I have been doing this for two years. My symptoms are headaches, nausea, upset stomach, heart pounding during the night and always tired. I either switch doctors or medicine. The doctors offers no solution and when I talk to him I get the impression that its normal.  I get the impression that 'he knows best' attitude. ",4,3,4

Amlodipine besylate 5mg is soooooo EVIL. IF I had known about this medication before I started taking it. I WOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO GET IT. This medicine makes you feel like you're having a heart attack and stroke. Trying to stop taking this medication is like you feel like you have an addiction. It's  like the medication tries to FORCE YOU to take it because of the harsh side effects. I had to basically dumped the medication down my garbage disposal. For 5 days I felt HORRIBLE.

Horrible, Horrible muscle cramping, in my arms, legs, feet and even neck and shoulder blade area, this cramping happened mostly at night, however during the day my entire body seemed to twitch, as if it was getting ready to cramp.

(265 to 245, 6'3', 66 yr old white male) I (on my own) stopped taking the med, and feel great, and my bp is staying down and quite reasonable.

Have other's experienced this situation?",3,1,1
"I have been taking this for about a year. Within the past 4 months, I haven't been able to sleep, have no energy, swollen feet, leg pain, dizziness (omg the dizziness), and stomach problems.

My biggest issues are the dizziness and the tiredness. I only sleep maybe 4 hours a day and I have ZERO energy. I already have back issues and can't handle the added leg and feet pain from taking this medication. I take this medicine for high blood pressure, which is isn't lowering very much. ",2,1,3

"I had an infected root canal which probably started my bp problem.  I was on Lisinopril but had to stop because of cough.  Amlodiprine 5mg helped for a while but I had these strange side effects. I thought I had developed allergies to some foods.  I tried everything.  Now I see that many people taking this drug  are experiencing the same symptoms I have.  Since the tooth issue is taken care of, I would like to stop the medication and see what happens.  The itching, tingling, increased heart rate, stomach bloating and problems, some leg and joint pain, and increased tingling in my ears.  I cut the pill in half and bp stayed 120/80 or less for about 3 months. It went up two nights ago, woke me up, and I took another 1/2 pill, symptoms got worse.  OK during the day.  Tonight I took a whole pill and bp went up,ringing in ears increased,stomach bloated. BP had been 102/73 before taking bp med.  Now it is 138/91. I cannot sleep.

It does a good job controlling my blood pressure.  But my liver enzymes have increased significantly.  I am now seeing a gastroenterlogist. We are still running tests but he thinks it is this drug that is causing me problems.  Lately I have started experiencing swollen ankles and feet.  And after reading some of the other reviews have determined that the joint pain and frequent headaches is probably from this medication as well.  I am in contact with my doctor; waiting for a call back.  I no longer want to take this drug.  It has too many major side effects.  ,3,1,5

I always had this painful full feeling after every meal and I have gained over 20 pounds, another side effect, which is so unusual for me.  There was also the issue of swelling of my feet.  This drug was very harmful and costly to me and I hope this reveiw helps others with their symptoms.",4,1,1

Started to us this drug along with Benicar 5mg at night.  It did help to lower my BP but I started to notice when I was in bed it felt as if my heart was outside of my chest and my face broke out.  Told the doctor about the rash and she said more than likely it was the Benicar and since the Amlodipine was working better she now have me trying it alone twice a day with a water pill Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG once a day.  Have been doing that for approx 3 weeks now and the blood pressure is almost sometimes lower than 120/80 in the AM but approx 130/85 at night.  I have now noticed that a several small bumps on both arms and both thighs and upper chest area and the face is like a road map.  Also have started to experience swelling ankles for the last 5 days. Thought it was due to excessive salt until I started to read the reviews.  Oddly enough I took the Benicar by itself for 3 days and the swelling of the feet went down.  Will now stop taking the Benicar and Amlodipine and go back to Diovan until I see my doctor in early May.,4,1,3

"I have been on this med two different times. In both cases, i suffered severe pain in my upper right back. Pain left once off medication in both instances.",5,1,3
"I was already on Ramipril(10mg)for HBP, but my BP wasn't reducing enough so the Doc advised me to have a combination of Olmesartan medoxomil/Amlodipine & Ramipril. This did reduce my BP at first, and seemed to be working very well for a few months.  However, a range of symptoms began to appearand take root nameley: swelling of ankles and lower legs; extreme depression and mood swings; increasing dizziness; lack of libido; insomnia; upper and lower back pain; body aches;chest pains (including palpitations);and finally, a lowering of my intellectual capacity (ie poor memory, inability to concentrate etc.) Please be warned that this drug CHANGED MY LIFE IN AVERY BAD WAY.  I have now been off this medication for 2 weeks and have no swelling at all in my legs and ankles, and the other 'side effects' are slowly but surely disappearing. My BP is marginally high, under control with other meds.",5,1,2
"This med worked very good in lowering my B/P. Having been recently told by my MD that my B/P is of a teenager's, I have endured tremedous suffering and pain. On a daily basis I go through a series of constant fatigue, hives/rashes, dizziness, flushing, INSOMMNIA, sweats and at times leg weakness or leg pains , including swelling from the knees to my ankles. I feel miserable and have no energy for anything. I push myself but it is only getting worse. Here's what I figured out since I have been on this med (approx 6-8 months). In the beginning it works really well with no notable side effects. However,as time goes on, the side effects begin to appear one at a time, becoming unbearable as time goes on. I beleive the manufacturing company purposely designed this med this way in order to get HBP suffers SOLD on its effectiveness and yet hiding the side effects that come on during theraputic use. I am now seeking a new Heart/ HBP Md that truely cares about his patients and not just what free golf outing or vacation he can get from the drug representative who convinces him to push POISON on to us patients. I am now suffering with ITP (lack of platelets) a blood disorder and I believe is as a result of this medication. Please use every precaution before and/or when using this Medication. If you are on it on get off it ASAP. This med can kill you",1,1,4
"I have had HPB for over 25 years and used other drugs in the past.  My BP had gotten harder to control and the Dr suggested Azor.  This medication is working very well, even during personally stress filled times in my life.  I have no known side effects and am very happy and would not hesitate to reccommend it to others.  I was hesitant to change, but am so glad the Dr insisted.",5,5,5
"The warning that this drug may be harmful to small children and pregnant women should have been a major red flag. I've been on BP meds for years. After retiring and losing 20 lbs Doc switched me to 4 MG (half a 8 MG pill) Atacand looking for a weaker med.  After being on Atacand for a month I ended up in the ER after my BP kept climbing all day (150/110), dizziness and pressure on my chest. I also was experiencing mental confusion. When they asked me in the ER who the president was, it took me a good 30 seconds to come up with his name! Very concerning. After being back on half a dose of my old med for a week, I am back to feeling like myself again. Avoid this drug if at all possible.",1,1,1
I have been on Atacand for 3 months. I immediately noticed bags under my eyes and tiredness. i have since noticed my hair thinning. i now have pain in my chest and blocked ear canals. The med has certainly lowered my blood pressure.,5,3,5

"Why is my supplier and also many local drug stores unable to get the generic brand of candesartan?  I now have to take the brand name and because we have to purchase through mail order, it is quite expensive!  Is there an ingredient missing?  Anyone know what the problem is?  Thank you!",5,4,5

"Taking Atacand 16mg for about 6 months.  Works effectively in keeping BP down, but now have Burning Mouth Syndrome.  Pharmacist says this is due to the build up of chemicals in the drug.  Dr. says ""not to worry.""  Also found hair is thinning.  Well, at least I'm alive.   ",4,3,4

Other meds for BP were awful.  Can't take diuretics, K falls too low and get cramps.  Pain seems to make my B.P high.  Have arthritis.",4,4,4
"I've been on Atacand plus 16mg for only 3 months and have notice joint pain in my hands, whether this is due to the drug or not can not say for sure. It has been effective in getting my blood pressure back to we're it should been. Must admit a little worried reading other comments that users may have obtained liver & kidney damage due to this medication, will be speaking to my GP about this when I see him next month for a follow up visit.",5,4,4
The info given when you buy your drug do'es not list all side effects. Thanks to Atacand I now have cirhosis. I had a C T scan in Jan. 2013 and no sign of it last week it was found on a new scan.I took it over 3 years and am fed up with drug companys! You can only find out the possible side effects if you look up the drugs on Web M D John,3,1,1

"I take half of a 4 mg Atacand  and all I can say is that after taking it about 1-2 hrs later I am so tired, my stomach is upset all day, and have a cough. My doctor told me to take 4 mg, with these side effects on just 2 mg I have  to be insane to take 4.  People talk to your doctor you are the only ones that really know how your body feels, and make sure they are listening.",3,1,2
I have been using this medication for about 10 years and have had no problems with this medication,5,5,5
"Since I have been on this med I have sinusitis, wheezing, leg and joint pain, insomnia, and am now noticing more problems with itching and rashes. I have made these complaints to my doctor. I have seen warnings of the drugs in this category and don't understand what it will take other than death for doctors to make connections of the drug and side-effects when presented at office visits. Why does the FDA not step in and stop the pharmaceutical companies from distributing drugs such as these. One has to see the commercials after people have died or suffered. I am going to request to be put on another medication for my treatment. Some doctors have a ""god complex"" and don't listen.",2,2,3

"I have been taking Atacand for over 6 mos.  It has helped with my HP but I'm having side effects of joint pain, stomach pain along with shoulder & left arm, & chest pain after I eat. I also get a stuffy nose and whease @ night when I go to sleep.  The joint pain is getting worse and so is the Stomach issues. This is the 5th drug I have tried and they all have terriable side affects for me.  Guess It is time to see the doctor again. age is 62 I'm in good health but over weight. Need to drop about 50 lbs.  hard to do while on drugs.",2,1,2
"I have been on Atacand 8mg for about 3 years. The medication has been effective in keeping my blood pressure level, but from the start, I have dizziness, itching and have gained weight. About 4 months ago my Dr increased dose to 16mg.  Since this time I have gained more weight. I am now 25lbs overweight.  I also have been feeling depressed to a point where I don't want to do anything. I am experiencing lower back pain, pain in ankle and now pain in my thigh.  The pain is to a point where I could barely walk without limping, go up or down stairs without assistance or even sit or lay down comfortably. AND OH MY GOODNESS, let me not forget, HAIR LOSS! from the start. I'm not sure if this is being caused by this Med, but would like to know if anyone else is experiencing this. By the way, this is the only medication I'm taking.    ",4,3,4

Seems to kick up my irritable bowel.  Anyone else?,4,2,3
"This has been a great medication for me. No side effects!!! My heart function while still less than half of normal is  enough for me to exercise, swim and have a mostly regular life.  However,  since the Feds dropped it from the formulary this year my insurance no longer covers it at any Tier level. So now I have to change to something else. It is really annoying when Politics messes around with your health care.",5,5,5
"I have been taking this medication for 7 months now and by the second month I had gained about 5-10 lbs. It seems like no matter how well I eat and exercise, I can't shed the weight. I'm also very very tired. On the plus side, my blood pressure is perfect! I'm going to ask my doctor if it is normal to gain weight and be so tired on this med.",5,3,5
Ive been taking Atacand for a few years along with other meds. I would always get a headache whenever I take the medicine but it would keep my blood pressure down. My main concern is the long term effect it is doing to my internal organs. My last doctors visit stated that I have signs of liver damage so I wonder does this medicine contribute to that issue.,3,1,3
"Like Alice, I too have had muscle aching in legs and joints. Also my joints (ie knees and ankles mostly) started cracking when I try to stand up from a sitting position! Not sure why, I have been on Diovan and Avapro and had the cracking of same joints, but not the leg muscles aching like I am getting with Atacand. Doctor hasn't suggested using something else yet. Anybody have idea as to where to go with another BP medicine to try? Please email me at [email protected]",3,2,2
I have been on Atacand for 6 months and have developed a lot of joint and muscle pain and muscle weakness.  I thought it was Flecainide that I am on also but after reading about this medication I am wondering if it is Atacand that is causing all this pain.  Has anyone else have pain from this?,5,2,3
"I have been taking Atacand for at least two years since my insurance took Cozaar off the preferred drug list.  It seemed to do alright but I had to reduce the dosage from 8mg to 4mg last year because of low blood pressure readings.  Recently I have not been feeling just right - light headed, tingly, sluggish with no energy.  Dr. took me off Atacand and I feel much better but after several days my pressure starts rising.  I am starting on Amlodipine 2.5mg maybe tomorrow.  I am a little reluctant to try another drug.  Wish I could control BP without medication.  ",4,3,4
"I was diagnosed with hypertension 5years ago and started medication with Micardes 80mg which at the start worked perfectly with truly low side effects but my blood pressure started to move up after 4years of Micardes. My doctor moved me to Micardes Plus which was quite good but for a short period of time. In one of the random checks my reading was 140/105 which triggered my doctor to give another medication in addition to the Micardis Plus but I never used it. I went to another doctor who replaced Micardis with Exforge. Oh God, was fatal on me with lots and lots of side effects. I thought I may die if I continued to use it then I tried the magical Atacand Plus. Frankly, it took sometime to work perfectly but now my readings is around 120/75 during the day and 105/65 at night. Very minimal side effects and feeling myself active and full of energy. I never saw those numbers (120/75) even in childhood. I hope it will continue to work well for me. Tip of advice, learn to calm down as much as possible, meditation and stay active as possible.

"High Blood pressure? Gone. Starting in the past few months, however, I have suffered decreased libido, affecting my life terribly. We have been married 31 years but still enjoy a healthy sexual relationship, until boom! I blame it on Atacand, though I have been taking it for a few years now. So do some side effects life this appear after you have been taking this drug quite a while? I might add there has been no change in my drug regimen. Nothing new has been added, nothing has been d/c'd.",4,4,4
I was using lisinopril before this one and starting havinbg a chronic cough from it...Then I was switched to atacand.  Atacand gave me severe headaches for 3 months before I realize it was this med.  So needless to say I am taking toprol XR.  And life has been wonderful.,1,1,1

"I had high blood pressure for years, was taking a medication and a diuretic, yet the BP was still too high. My friend encouraged me to see a cardiologist who helped her husband with his BP, and she prescribed Atacand, along with my other meds. For the first time, my BP was just great, and I have felt fine using it for the last few years. Now my health insurance doesn't have it on its ""favored"" list, and I would have to pay $100 for it vs. $10 or $50 for the drugs it has on its list. I talked to my family dr. about it and she switched me to Diovan, which was the closest type of similar medication recommended by the health insurance. This is my first month on Diovan, so I don't yet know how my BP is doing on this med. But I really don't feel quite the same, feel like I am having some palpitations, which I never had. Don't know whether it is just because I am paying more attention to it now, or is really due to the change in meds? Be happy if your insurance covers Atacand. I am thinking of switching back even though it is more expensive.",5,5,5

"taking one month, BP staying around 125/75 or lower, get headaches from it occasionally, but relieved with aspirin; no difference in urine output, seems effective for me",5,4,5
"This has been a very effective drug for my blood pressure, but the cost is prohibitive on  us being retired, the cost of $270.94 for a 90 day supply is much higher than we can afford.  Is there another medication which will be as effective?",5,5,5
"I have had trouble with various BP meds this is the only one that has controlled my BP. I cannot tolerate Calcium Channel blockers, Beta Blockers or Alpha blockers.",5,5,5
Keeps blood pressure normal,5,5,5
when my doctor first prescribed this medication i was gatting a little dizzy he made a adjustment and my blood pressurs is usually 120over 80.i am a big guy247lbs and 64 years old.a great medicine.,4,4,4
Urrinate every 2 hrs. during night.  Do I really need the diuretic?,4,4,4
I have had HBP for my entire adult life. This medication is the only one that can control my HBP with no side effects.,5,5,5
"This is only the 2nd medication I have taken for high blood pressure. I started on the Atacand only and switched to Atacand/HCT. After one day of slight drowsiness, I have felt NO complication or unusual effects other than a consistent 120/80 BP. This is an amazing drug-no nitceable bad effects and has not impaired sexual performance as other BP meds do. Strongly recommend (I am in my mid 40s).",5,5,5
"I was diagnosed with high blod pressure about six months ago. Initially, I had some dizziness but that subsided and it definately affected the sex life initially.  With changes in diet and a little exercise my blood pressure is now in the normal range- 120/80",5,4,4
This is a very effective drug but I noticed that Express Scripts has removed it from their preferred formulary and recommend Diovan HCT or Hyzaar.   I do have some light headed feeling but I don't know what it is related to since I also take some other meds.  ,5,4,4
"I have been taking Atacand for 5 months now, the early slight dizziness passed quite quickly and now I have no side effects.  I am wondering whether it has a detrimental affect on libido though?",5,4,4
it has helped me lower my blood pressure,4,4,4
"I have been useing Atacand HCT for going on 4 years now, and its the only high blood pressure medicine that I can take that works great with out makeing me tired or dizzy.",5,5,5
"I have been taking this med for 3 weeks, it has lowered by Bp to 108/62.  I feel weakness, dizziness especially when I stand up quickly.  I see my doc in one week for 4 week follow up, hopefully side affects will subside. ",4,3,4
I now need a generic brand to replace the Atacand HCT 32-12.5,5,5,5
"My husband was on amlodipine 5mg table and he gain a lot of fluid retention about 15 lb , and his ankles and feet were really  swollen. Then he switched to losartan and his fluid retention increased and liver enzymes and potassium went up. Is there blood pressure that doesn't make weight gain?  ",1,1,1
I was admitted at the local Hospital as an emergency with extremely low blood pressure/semi conscience.  While in the ICU I experienced rapid heart beat which the heart  Doctor more than an hour to get to slow in down to normal speed.  After which they place me on Amlodipine-atorvastatin Oral.,5,5,5
no problem at all,5,5,5
very effective,5,5,5
good experience with the drug. but hair loss was the big side effect for me. ,5,4,5
"This has taken all my energy tired all day and night. I can get 8 up to 10 hours of sleep and wake up feeling totally exhausted wore-down, barely able to get out bed. It has affected my memory, and concentration and I have to research tax cases. I can be watching a program on tv and a commercial will come on and couldnâ??t I tell you what program I watching. I was taking Lipitor it was perfect my nature, personality, attitude, energy was excellent. Would wake able to get out of bed with energy, and not feeling like I havenâ??t slept in week or ran a marathon. This crap SUCKS. Also, this other substitute oval-shaped AVN 80 on one side and APO on the other side. Donâ??t take this it has the same affect. This is not helping when your are totally drained of energy. When something is working they take it away and experiment on us with these faulty drugs. Please report this drug and all the other substitute. ",1,1,1
"Fast weight gain which seemed counter productive.  Itching but didn't realize till after I went off that it was probably due to the meds.  Went off as I was loosing my ability to concentrate, think and memory.  When doing research I decided to look up a particular item.  Turned around to type it and had no idea what I was doing.  Not like me so I checked out tthe meds and I fit several of the bad side effects.  Went off and within a week was getting back to normal.   ",3,1,1
"I didn't know why they had prescribed this drug for me. I ran across some info about it on the internet that made want to look at the side affects. I had a lot of them. The main ones were achy muscles and joints,Blurry vision, and I just couldn't function. I quit taking it and I feel much more alive after open heart surgery. I asked the doctors why I'm taking it and they said it was to prevent another heart attach. There were several problems in my life which led to my surgery. I know high cholesterol wasn't one of them. This drug is also known as Lipitor.",1,1,1
It lowered my cholesterol almost 100 points in 3 months but I started having severe leg aches and back pain plus extreme fatigue. I had no motivation to do anything. I stopped taking the drug and within a couple days my leg pain decreased 90% and I now have a lot more energy.,5,1,5
"As far as lowering bad cholesterol levels and triglycerides this worked. The side effects for me included a rise in blood sugar (A1C), itch/rash, and ED. I had tried to stop the medication for a couple of weeks and I was feeling fine but then noticed the heavy breathing coming back with being light headed and dizzy. I have been on Lipitor for over 10 years.",5,2,5
I took 40mg for a year and a half.I stopped when I started falling because of week legs.I became so weak that I now can only walk with a walker.I bought an elect. scooter which I use now.I have been to many doctors with no help.I  think I need a good lawyer.,1,1,1
It brought all my bad readings down but caused severe UTI.  The pain stopped in one day when I stopped taking it.  This was all confirmed by my urologist.      ,5,1,5
"Traditionally have 280-ish cholesterol with plenty of bad cholesterol.  Atorvastatin brings it down to below 180 within about a month.  If I stop taking it for a few weeks, the number shoots back up.  Good cholesterol also improves with the medicine.",5,5,5
Lowered my cholesterol to safe levels but it seems to cause problems with mental clarity. I have problems with my concentration. Has had no effect on triglycerides. ,4,2,4
"I'm 3 months in. Was blood tested for a different doctor 2 weeks after starting it and my LDL had dropped a dramatic amount already. Blood test last week had my LDL in healthy levels, triglycerides in healthy levels, and HDL was still okay.  No side effects noticed.",5,5,5
"This drug lowered my cholesterol by almost 75 points and my high cholesterol remained good.  Only on 10mg. However,  I get a buzzing in my head and am wondering if it is this medication.  Anyone else have this sensation?",5,5,5
I had been taking this medication for at least 2 years.  I have lost 42 pounds and that is when my pain in my knees and thighs became severe.  Dr. took me off this med and has made a large improvement in pain level.  Much better.,2,1,2
"It did lower my high bad cholesterol, but also lowered my good cholesterol and that's NOT good, and had a lot of chest pain on 20mg, so went down to 10 mg and it got rid of chest pain, but I know a lot of weight gain since taking it. Does anybody retained a lot of fluid on it? ",3,1,2
I have been through a few high cholesterol medications through the years.  I have had high cholesterol since I was 18 yrs old (thanks Dad). I have been on Atorvastatin since 2008 and it was worked wonderfully for me.  No side effects and hoping it will stay that way.     ,5,5,5
"I've been taking 40mg daily, with no problems.  Cholesterol is falling like a rock.  I also have high blood pressure with reading all over the charts.  Now, my readings have stabilized. I've also noticed the color of my blood is now a nice bright red, rather the reddish-brownish color it was before.  Also, my heart rate has fallen for the low high 70's - 80's to the low to mid 60's.  I exercise on a stair step machine 25 minutes, twice daily, and have included more salads and other greens into my diet.  Overall, I am feeling much better, and friends have said I look a lot healther than before.",5,5,5
Had extreme pain with muscle cramping and it affected my head with inability to think clearly or communicate and it was stopped after taking 1 pill.,1,1,1
My experience with this drug is that it has help my cholesterol and have no side effects.,5,5,5
doctor prescribed medication without informing me of reason for medication and  required dietary restrictions (grapefruit). I experienced extreme anxiety and confusion. I stopped the medication and seeking a new primary care doctor. ,3,1,3
Name the side effect and I got it. Side effects began on 2nd day. I don't understand with so many drugs for lowering cholesterol why any doctor would prescribe this one. Would never take again.,1,1,1
I was hesitant at first but unlike others I started with bad knees and it was like a complete reversal of years of swelling vanished over the first 3 months. My doctor was surprised and thought it might be a combination of nasid I have been taking and this. Stopped taking the 20mg Atorvastatin for a month and the swelling started to return. Went back on and it's gone. I would love to know if others have found similar results or if maybe its just the Tampa humidity.,4,4,4
"Started taking this medicine about 10 days ago. At first I had a little muscle pain, but that is now gone. Also had a mild headache for a few days, but that too is gone. I seem to be actually sleeping a little better. I won't know if this stuff is helping for a couple months until my follow up appointment. I'm not sure if I would take this medication after reading some of these reviews. I'll just have to cross my fingers.......",3,4,3
"Have been taking this in a low dose for 2 years. Last 2 months I have had brain fog, difficulty concentrating and lots of joint pain in hips, elbows and knees. went to doctor andam being takenoff drug for4 weeks",3,1,3
"Fortunately, i have had no side effects from this drug. I have felt much better since taking this and will continue to do so",4,4,4
"Took 40mg last night for the first time. Had to come home from work after 4 hours this morning due to severe pain in knees shoulder and back. Feel like I'm in a fog,hurt all over stomach is all upset. I will never take one of these pills again. ",1,1,1
"Horrible muscle pain and weakness especially in arms and shoulders. Increased joint pain all over. I cant understand why my Dr gave me this drug since there are many other drugs without the severe side-effects. I went to my Dr and told him about the pain I was having and he said ""your muscles are atrophying"" and that I needed to exercise. I would exercise if I didnt feel like I was dying every time I try to move. THIS STUFF SUCKS!!!",3,1,3
"My doctor knew I had muscle pain before but told me to try it and see.  Very effective but upper arm, shoulder pain is worse, now I have hip pain, swollen ankles, itchy all over, etc.  I will make an apt. to see my doctor to get off this drug.",5,1,5
"This medication has cause my joints to hurt, especially my arms and elbows. Severe pain",3,1,3
"Took 10mg 1 year ago, thought I was going to die.  I stuck in there to see if I could get over the terrible side effects of terrible pain in my right arm to my elbow and terrible pain in all my joints.  My cholesterol went down dramatically.  Tried a different statin with little muscle pain but also no significant lowering of my cholesterol.  Atorvastatin is like poison to my body.  I will try another statin.  Some people can take it with little pain, I thought I was going to die.",1,1,5
works great  in reducing bad cholestorol..,5,5,5
"I have been taking 40 mg of Atorvastatin for 5 months now and it has reduced my total Cholesterol levels from 340 to 145, and has reduced my Triglycerides to 113. No significant side effects - my memory was slightly ""fuzzy for a while, but that cleared up in short order, and my memory is actually better than it was!",5,5,5
"I passed on taking statins for years because of leg cramping. New dr. told me that COQ10 helps absorb the statin and also stops the leg cramps. Taking statin now without the horrible cramping. recommend highly this advice, but talk w/ your dr. first.",4,4,4
"I am taking it after having a heart attack 5 months ago when plaque broke off and hit my heart.  I only had two spots with plaque built up.  Stents were put in, and I am doing great.  I am having memory problems that I attribute to this drug.  My other concern is that I don't have high cholesterol, yet the cardiologist wants me on this for life.  I don't get a answer that satisfies the ""why for life?""  ""Because"" isn't enough.  I am on blood thinner for a year, and plan to stop the atorvastatin at the same time.  I hope the memory loss isn't permanent.",3,2,3
"As with any medication a physical and/or mental reaction is always possible, but this medication has worked very well for me.  It has lowered my cholesterol and now if I can just get my blood pressure under control.  I had no bad reaction with this medication but I do have anxiety issues once in a while.  So I must realize when it is a panic attack, or an anxiety issue and not the medication.  It is way too easy for me to focus on the oh no, issues.  Mostly when it is a new medication, and believe me I have been on a few in my life time.  But this medication seems to be ok, but I would always ask the physician to start me out on the smallest dosage possible, and try to know the difference between the effect of the medication and my anxiety issue.  Shoot it always seems like something, at my age, God Bless and good luck.  ",4,5,4
Dizzy most days to the point I cant function,1,1,1
I have been taking this medication for the past 3 months at 40Mg level with no side affects or problems.,5,5,4
"I've been taking this drug for several years. I was not aware of the side effects. I've had fibromyalgia most of my life so I thought my severe muscle and joint pain was from FMS. Also, in the past few years, while on this med, I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes even though I am not overweight according to BMI. A couple weeks ago i stopped taking this statin and I cannot believe how much better I feel.  I think the side effects of this drug should be emphasized!!  It can make you very miserable! ",1,1,1
"my neck hurts. no pain prior to this medication. does anyone know is a possible side effect is weight gain and not sleeping well at all on drug a month now ,another blood test in six weeks if i stay on that long.",2,2,2
"I have had high cholesterol for years, now my triglycerides are up and my good cholesterol is way down. I had neck and hip pain before taking this with 10000 IU vitamin d3 and omega 3, changed diet and began exercising. I feel pretty good, it has only been 2 weeks so we will see what happens over 3 months.",5,5,5
its a helpful drug.after few hrs. you feel normal.,3,3,3
"I started taking this medication going on 3mths with a BP medication, I took it for a month and I started having severe muscle spasms especially down my left leg. I called my Dr.'s office spoke with my Dr. he told me to stop taking it, I had stopped a week prior because the pain is unbearable, it is going on almost 3mths since I stopped taking this medication and my symptoms seem to be getting worse, I can't sleep, walk, stand, or even sit for long periods of time. I use Icy Hot, Blue Emu, Capsazine, etc. etc. to rub into my muscles to ease the pain, nothing works. I used to teach salsa classes, I danced regularly, I played with my grandchildren and now I do none of the above. I cannot tolerate this pain anymore, I want my legs back, this is destroying my personal life. I was not told that this medication could ruin my everyday life. Stay away from it.",1,1,1
"I was very lethargic and had bad lower back pain which I still have. I didn't feel like doing anything, total lack of motivation. I took for around 3 months until I realized this is what was causing all my problems.  I felt so bad I thought my cancer was back. I've been off for around 3 weeks. I'm having more energy but my back still hurts with a few other side effects.",1,1,1
"My doctor wanted me to take 10 mg of atorvastatin in stead of the 10 mg of simvistatin that I've been taking for years to lower my cholesterol.  I've been taking it now for  3 or 4 weeks.  I've been experiencing leg cramps at night, and swollen ankles all day long.  Prior to taken this drug, I had notice some ankle swelling at night only.  Now my ankles are always swollen.  I've also notice feelings of impatience, anxiety and memory impairment.  A few days ago while attending an charity function, thirty mintues into the program I began to perspire profusely, stomach upset and extreme dizzyness.  I thought I was having a heart attach.  The attendants called 911, they took my blood pressure and it was extremely high.  They had me stand up and the BP dropped to 81/40.  Never experience this before.  ER   ran tests:  EKG, blood work, chest Xray, urine...everything came back normal.  What in the heck was that all about?  Dehydration??  Heat stroke, or the new statin meds? ",3,1,1
I had a heart attack at age 50 with heart disease in my family. I am on 80mg of this drug and found that my memory and concentration is so bad it is effecting my employment. I am even becoming nervous about going out to do errands as I get forgetful about what to do. I rely on lists and phone alarms but even forget to do those things. The things i am forgetting are common every day activities including picking up kids. I am struggling to even find the right words to type this.  Been on drug for 7 months. Seeing Dr today to drop the drug. Would rather curb dietary habits then to live like this.,5,1,2
"I took this med for 7 days. day three neck pain day four and five neck and right shoulder day six pain so bad stop taking med no sleep day seven went to er 4;30am done 2ekg took x rays couldn't find a thing. stop med all together, day nine pain gone took tylenol 3 for pain.   not good med for me.[atorvastatin or pravastatin]",1,1,1
"My wife took atorvastatin for two years, and stopped about two months ago due to muscle pain in her knees. Perhaps coincidentally, she had developed an increasing sensitivity to gluten which gave her consistent stomach problems whenever she ate a gluten-containing product. Since she stopped taking the atorvastatin (with no other changes to her medicines or diet), she can now eat gluten. This change was gradual, suggesting a direct relation to the gradual elimination of statin remnants in her system.",2,1,2
"I have a little higher than normal cholesterol but have always been told my good cholesterol counter affects the bad.  I have been taking atorvastatin for one month and have started to have pain in my left shoulder and now it is beginning in my left hip.  Also seem to be having a problem remembering things, etc.  I have talked with my doctor and even though he does not think it is the drug I think the side affects are not worth the good affects it has on me.  I'll stop taking it on my own for a month and see if there is a change in the affects that I have been having.",5,1,3
"I have been on an Atorvastatin as well as BP lowering meds for apprx 3 1/2 years now. My Cholesterol went from about 212 down to 122! This drug works! I have experienced minor muscle aches and pains in my legs but the benefits far outway the side effects. Besides, I have my GF run an Epson Salt bath and soak my aching muscles once every couple of weeks and I'm a happy guy..",5,4,5
"Can't really say if it will work for me or not. The first day I took this med. I had pain in jaw, behind left shoulder blade, left arm. I thought I was having a heart attack, scared the crap out of me.I also had nausea, which I thought was from the pain. After reading some of these reviews I believe it was just side effect from this medication. I have also had cramps along with diarrhea since day one to. My Dr. may not be happy with me but I am through with this. There has got to be some other way to lower cholesterol. A little concerned though my cholesterol is 386. I've never had this problem before, Need to find something else!   ",1,1,1
"Have taken for 4 years. 7 months ago, began having severe muscle pain in upper left arm which I attributed to the flu shot. Pain continued & about a month ago, the same pain began in the right arm. Also, lots of pain in both hips for approximately 5 months. I quit taking for the last week and have not had nearly as much pain for the last couple of days. Will be calling my doctor.",5,1,3
"WHile this worked to help my husband's cholesterol, he had extreme memory issues.  We thought he had developed dementia!  NOT GOOD! Took him off the meds and saw immediate improvement.  However, he is having problems with memory. I've read that damage can be permanent or take months to reverse. We do not recommend!",3,1,3
"I have been taking this drug for 4 weeks now along with BP lowering drugs. Almost since day one I have been suffering stomach and bowel cramps and constipation. Nausea in the morning is common and belching follows every meal.I have also felt tired with muscle aches in the upper arms, back and legs. Now I am no spring chicken and expect some wear and tear to show in my day but the immediate reaction to this drug in my case was quite marked. I will be asking to return to Simvastatin at my next check-up with the Doc.",3,1,3
"I have been taking Atorvastatin for over a month. My total cholesterol has gone from 221 to 169 which made me very happy. But I don't like the side effect I have been feeling. Cramps on my legs, Jaw Pain. Muscle Pain and Tiredness. I will be calling the doctor to discuss these feelings.",4,3,5

I was taking Simvastatin for several years. I started experiencing some minor side effects about a year ago. Dr switched me to atorvastatin. My bad cholestoral has been lower no side effects so far.,5,4,4
"Doctor switched me to atorvastatin two months ago from simvastatin.I have had muscle pain,slight memory problems,tiredness.I am going back on simvastain which i took for 20 years with no problem.",4,3,4
Take Statins for 20 years now.  Lipitor is the most effective for my metabolism.  I take it earlier in the day.  Somehow the Statin increases my metabolism and subsequently hinders sleep when I take at bedtime.  No problems when taken earlier in the day.,5,5,5
"Wow. I haven't been on this very long, but I feel so sick after taking it. Worse than any illness I've ever had. Extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, difficulty swallowing, and the list goes on. Just too dizzy to try to do anything important. Taking 20mg. I want off this medication. What else is there?",4,1,2
"For last 20 years I;m on different Satatins, some are more effective then others. Now after this period I have blood glucose gone up and am a borderline diabetic patient. for which I take medication. I have been told and by physicians and read all Statins increase blood sugar. And many other side affects either ignored or not mentioned by drug companies in detail. Had I was not on this medication I could have a stroke or hear problem, though i never had any heart problem, blood pressure or diabetes when i started this medication  20 years ago only High cholesterol. ",5,4,4
I take 40mg atorvastatin. Started with Lipitor in 2008 prescribed by Heart doctor since I have had 3 procedures for stents to unblock arteries. He switched me to atorvastatin a couple of years ago. Leg cramps at night most serious side effects. Total Chol is 169 HDL -51 LDL - 105. Last 9 months PCP put me on 500 mg metformin 2 times a day for type 2 diabetes. End of Sept/14 doubled metformin since AIC was 8.4. Had severe uncontrollable diarrhea and gas. Stopped the extra dose and now he added 5mg glipizide divided am  and pm to the metformin. I read that statins can cause type 2 diabetes and did not have it until 2 years ago. I am going to concentrate on losing weight and adding more exercise to see if I can eventually get off these drugs or at least reduce the dosage. I feel all these meds are working against each other. It is frustrating.,4,3,3
" Was on the generic atorvastatin took myself off of it, after having extreme joint pain, chest pain, neck pain for three years. Have been on statins for over 15 years with general pain and joint pain. All my pain issues went away seems I'm not older like my doctors seem to want to defer to or doing work that I'm not used to, like my doctors say. Right now I am pissed off because it seems my complaints over the years have been defaulted to thinking I am wrong about my pain. It was after talking to a neighbor about my knee pain that he told me that statins were shutting down his liver, he went on to tell me about lower chronic back pain and leg pain which I also had.  I had a heart attack three years ago and had a stent put in and my level of statins upped from 20mg to 80mg which is when I really started to have constant chronic pain. You need to be your own watch dog on the medications your doctors give you, because they won't tell you it is the meds doing it to you. The AMA tells them its OK and that ruling is the bible to doctors. Since being off of statins for over a month I feel like I have gone back in time 20 years, I don't have pain I have soreness when I work which is normal. I have more energy, I don't have the stiff neck I have had for over three years, I don't have the tight chest like I've had. I do have less respect for people I thought were working with me only to find out they want me back on the statins. High cholesterol runs in my family my mother died at 86 after falling and going into a coma, not because of her high cholesterol. What I am trying to say is you know your self better then anyone be your own advocate. Trust that most doctors are going to do what the AMA tells them to do, not what is best for you. ",2,1,2
"I am so confused. I'm trying to get info on why after several months taking this my ""bad"" Cholesterol has effectively gone higher and my ""good"" cholesterol has consistently gone lower! Two months now on 80mg 1Xdaily. HELP explain this to me!   ",5,1,1

"I am a fit, energetic who has run and worked out for many years. Dr. prescribed this for my high cholesterol and I took it for three weeks. I have never been prescribed a drug that made me feel so bad, in so many different ways. Extreme muscle pain, mostly in the legs, malaise, lack of energy, lack of motivation, mental fuzziness, sleep issues. How can a prescription be effective when it removes all motivation by making you feel bad? Do not understand why Drs are so quick to put patients on drugs when they know how many side effects there are. I was not really warned about all these issues but when I started experiencing them it only took a few seconds to find out how many other people have had major problems with this stuff. I returned them to the Dr and will take my chances...",1,1,1
"took for 1 wk. had muscle pain, jaw pain, swollen neck glands, sores in mouth.  stopped for 2 wks and went back on med.  this time, upper back pain, swollen glands, chest tightness and depression symptoms are terrible bordering on full on rage feelings. this stuff is scary.  ",4,1,1

For days I have not known what to do with myself because of terrible musclesbcramps in my legs,can't slepp,can't concenrate,can't stay still just doing anything to get rid of it and now I have found this page and found it is a side effect.

I noticed that I felt better as the day progressed and looked at the pill I was about to take;then to the internet and decided to discontinue use. The two incidents happened about the same time - 3:30-4:00am. It was an amazing improvement the next morning without the pill, all symptoms were gone except for the numbness in fingers. Again, as the day progressed, I'm feeling like a totally different person. This is just a warning to all, and especially diabetics, that statins can have severe reactions. Trust your gut!

"I began taking Azor after experiencing severe side effects with Lisinopril. In the beginning, Azor worked wonderfully! Very little side effects. After a year of using this drug it became my worst nightmare. I began experiencing severe side effects. Irregular heart rhythm, itching, tingling, nausea, anxiety, the list goes on! I thought I was going to have a stroke or heart attack everyday for the last two years! Side effects were so severe, I spent the past two years doing very expensive and time-consuming test only to be told the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with my heart, my liver, gallbladder etc! Tons of test to find out the Azor was the cause of all of my medical issues. I had changed insurance companies and they would not pay for the Azor. So I was given a prescription for amlodipine and Benicar. I couldn't afford the Benicar so in the mean time I only had the Amlodopine to take. While I waited for my doctor to get back to me, after going a week without the olmesartan, I realized I hadn't had any heart palpitations and I felt like my old self again. That's when I realized it was the Azor! After two very scary years of E.R. visits, being told I had anxiety, and was paranoid, I find out that the Azor was the problem the whole time! Please do your research. I am sure had I not stopped this medication, it would have resulted in a worse outcome for me! I thank God that I was forced to go without it. Otherwise I may have never discovered what it was doing to me. ",4,1,4

Tingling in the arm has been reduced to tingling in the fingers only in the mornings. ",4,4,4
I used to be on Benicar 40 didn't work well been on this Azor for the last week haven't had a day without a headache since... BP seems to be stabilizing but these headaches are just... A headache yuck!,4,3,4
Pressure still too low but otherwise toohigh,5,5,5
"This drug has lowered my blood pressure, but now there is uncomfortable swelling in my legs. Don't know how much longer I can stand the side effects.",4,1,4
I have been taking this drug for about 2wks. My pressure has come down from 145/85 to 125/70..5/20mg Azor.  The 1st week was good. I only had swelling in my left ankle and coughing out my head. The 2nd wk I had notice Pvc's (palvations) and tingling in my hands some morning and cold fingertips (flu like systoms) some times.  Sometimes my chest feels like it is about to pop out.  I am to return to the doc in about 2wks unless get to feeling worse. ,5,3,3

"I started having swelling in my feet, particiularly my left foot.  I stopped this medication and a week later I still have this swelling and it's most uncomfortable.",3,1,2
5/20 was not effective.  I had a BP spike of 190 over 96.  (t was increased to 10/40 and there's been only 1 episode of 180 over 83.,3,2,1
Azor 5/40 has helped me lower my BP and consistently 100-110/70-80. Downside is the high price but definitely worth every hundred dollar spent.,5,5,5
works exceedingly well.  Cialis no longer needed.,5,5,5
I have developed headaches since started using.,5,1,2
Does not seem to have many side effects like some blood pressure med i have taken before.,5,5,5

as far as i know the drug is working but i have a question about the odor from the container,1,1,1
been taking azor for 2 yrs.+bp stable but urinate every 2 hours at night.,5,2,2
It has been the only bp medication that has worked for me in 45 years. I've had hpb since I was 21. I'm now off of it because the VA won't spend the money on it and I lost my health insurance thank you Obama and Democrats,5,5,5

"Azor 1/2 of 5/20 in AM. Was on lisinopril for 12yrs-down to 10 mg last few. Good: no more lump in throat, regained taste. Tinitus no longer roaring- much softer. Azor works most of time. No water retention. Con: vision not as clear. some sore muscles-don't walk as fast or far.  if take in evening will be asleep quickly. some difficulty concentrating, groggy a lot. some sporadic chest squeeze pain -nothing too scarey yet. pulse rate often too high - don't know whether the Azor is keeping it down or pushing it up. Tried Diovan - worse than ACE - deafening tinitus, rapid pulse, etc. Is there a choice without the ACE throat lump and tinitus and the ARB weariness, etc. Want to regain my pep and zip without the noise and loss of sense of taste.  and it has to keep BP down and not mess with pulse.",4,4,4
"I have had backaches, frequent urination, and major weight gain.  I need to go back to Doctor.  This is the second BP Med I have been but on.  The first, I had backache, and swollen ankles. ",5,2,3
Azor works well at controlling my high blood pressure but I have severe edema(swelling) in my feet and ankles.  I also have back pain when walking.  Frequent urination during the night keeps me from getting a good nights sleep. Tired and miserable-will switch to something else.  ,4,1,4

My daughter was convinced that I have developed Alzheimers, as my father had, and would have to be sent to a facility for patients with severe memory loss.  Worst of all, I simply could not get enough sleep, could not read novels for I would immmediately forget whai zI read, and in general was miserable.  I understand that the memory loss is relatively rare, but my experience was that it was quite severe and extremely frightening, given my family history.",3,1,3

Great stuff!  Dropped my BP to a avarage of 125/70 sometimes less and from a high of 180/105 almost over night.  Been on it a week no side effects noting.  Great med! I have taken others and stopped because of the side effects. Try it ! ,5,5,5

"My mom was just taken off of Azor after several weeks of bad confusion and memory problems, as well as tiredness, insomnia, high anxiety and many other things. I didn't realize that Norvasc was in it when he put her on it and she reacted to it several years ago, so why he put her on it again,I don't know. He has her on Benicar alone now and she is feeling more clear headed now, but it has a side effect of confusion too, so she may not come out of it all the way. She was on a bladder med that had confusion as a side effect too. I'm now taking her to an alternative practioner and he should be able to help her without doing more harm. It has been so hard to see her go through this and she doesn't tolerate any BP meds. She ended up in the hospital 3 times one year, due to side effects. I hope this helps others avoid the same suffering.",4,1,3
very good,5,5,5
All is great but my blood sugar is high is there a reason this might be affected?,5,5,5

"Hot flashes, made my face and neck turn red/flush. Very uncomfortable.",5,1,1
After taking Azor for a few months I noticed a rash between my breast and brought it to the attention of the Dr but he didn't think it was due to the Azor. I didn't have the rash until I started taken the Azor. I'm trying to go back to my old medicine,1,1,3
"Was taking 2 pills a day for HBP before beginning azor.  The azor brought my blood pressure down to readings like 107/70.  The first couple of weeks on it were pretty good some dizziness, heart racing, etc. but nothing I couldn't live with to achieve those numbers.  However, beginning between the second and third week of treatment, I began to notice that within an hour or two of taking my azor I would start with nausea and then developed uncontrollable diarrhea in the days to come.  Dr. insisted couldn't be azor and even treated me for something else.  My belief is to look to what's different in your life to discover the cause.  After a couple of weeks on the doctors prescribed treatment, I went back to my old HBP meds for a few days and symptoms started abating.  Kept on them until everything back to normal.  Yesterday for the first time tried azor again since it gave me such perfect numbers, within a few hours the nausea, vomiting and watery diahhrea began again.  Am seeing my doctor today to get refills for my old meds.  Don't get me wrong, for some I'm sure this is a wonderful drug as it does lower bp beautifully.  Unfortunately, there's just something my digestive system can't handle.",5,1,5

this drug causes my temperature to rise.,2,2,2
"Azor works well to bring down my BP. Side effects that have bothered me are: back pain, nasal congestion(that has lasted over a year) and increased blood sugar levels.

I have been taking Azor for about a month because of my high blood pressure. The only side effect is the irregular hearbeat sometimes which I have to tell my doctor about. other than that the medication is really helping.   ,5,5,5

"Washed out, sleepy,dizziness at night when first standing,",2,2,4
"bp dropped to 120/80 but wouldn't stay consistant. Side effects were mild but tolerable up until the 3rd week. Side effects included low leg cramps, pain in upper chest area that radiated down my left arm, short sharp jolting pain in my left temple, light headness, dizziness, little nausea, itchy throat, and a head ache that may have been caused by the sinus infection that I had while taking Azor. You may have cold chills that last for about 30-45 minutes also. I would not recommend this medication it has too many side effects that interupt everyday activities.",5,1,3
"I have been among those who get dizzy if I get up too quickly. My lower calves are tingly..like just falling asleep. I have noticed a slight discoloration in them as well. My lont distance stamina is shot. I get winded easily. I used to run 2 miles a day, but have settled for working out. I am very satisfied with the way the azor works. I was 150/100 and am now 100/65. I will take the side effects as a trade off.",5,5,5

"I'm only on Azor for 2 weeks, (5/20mg) has lowered my BP and had slight trouble at begining with BM.   Now appears to be fine and have more energy , with less sleep (7 hours solid)and feel much more focused.  I'm not a big fan of drugs,  but pressure started climbing in a 4 month period to 170/115. For years I was on 10 mg of ziac, a 5mg. valium, a 81 mg asprin and a multi vitamin.   I'm 60 and have been told by many medical proffesionals my doctor is right on the money with his diagnoses and prescreptions.  Keep in mind this is new for my system, will keep a close eye on it but has brought my pressure in range 135/88 in a 2 week period.",5,5,5
The is the first drug that has brought my blood pressure under complete control.,5,5,5
I had been taking cardizem for a few years and it helped to keep my blood pressure at a managable level but I was not feeling well still.  My Dr. started me on Azor 12 days ago and I almost fell off the side of my bed after about 4 days because my blood pressure was down to 99/60.  It now runs 126/75- 88/59.  I have notice  marked difference in the puffiness in my hands and I have more energy.  I started on the 5/20mgs and I am now taking 5/40mgs.  I am also taking Crestor for my cholesterol.  I will stay with this unless it ceases to be effective for me.  I was on Toprol for years and it did nothing for me.,5,5,5
"Treatment of life long high blood pressure, typically 150/100 and apparently highly resistant to lowering. Most recently I was on increasing dosages of Hyzaar, ending in maximum one. That was the reason for switch to Azor. Azor 5/40 have not impacted my BP in measurable way. Azor 10/40 with 25mg ""water pill"" (hydrochlorothiazide) have brought it to  ideal levels (120's/80's) within a week. No common side effects (ex. swelling) now but uncommon one: significantly increased fatigue of arms and legs. I am quite active so this was easily spotted within days of starting Azor 10/40 and still remains. Estimated 1/4 to 1/3 more specifically leg and arm muscle fatigue vs. while on Hyzaar. As I haven't had any side effects with Hyzaar I'll attempt switching back to it in the future. Previously to Hyzaar I was taking Atenolol. Compared with Atenolol side effects, I'd rather take Azor. (With Atenolol I experienced much more general and stronger, both physical and mental fatigue).",4,3,5
"I have tried several different high blood pressure medicines and everyone gave me severe cramping and pain (legs, thighs, back, sides, everywhere). As soon as I went on Azor, my blood dropped to a normal level and I rarely have any cramps at all.  This tiny pill has worked wonders for me",5,5,5
5/20..I do have some swelling in the legs and some face flushing.  Now I do have hot flashes but I can tell this is different and more intense.  No cough.  Would like to change to something cheaper but it works pretty well so I may have to just make it work.,4,3,4
"I have HBP and small artery atherioscloros which causes alot of chest pain and burning.  Was switched to Azor from Hyzaar.  Azor gave me terrible chest pains and heart beat so hard I didn't sleep for 4 days and nights.  Stopped taking and went back on Hyzaar but after 2 weeks, still have some bad heart palpitations.",1,1,1
"bad headaches,no energy,no appetite",1,1,1
"shortness of breathe, and some swelling of legs",4,3,3
"The HBP is secondary to a condition I have call PCOS(PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome).  The azor lowers the HBP to a great range, but the swelling of tissue is a horrible side effect for me.  It actually agrevates the PCOS and causes me to have month long(or longer) menstral cycles.  My Dr. tried telling this wasn't the case, but When I stopped taking it The PCOS got back under controll.  I started taking it ona daily basis again, and the bleeding started again.  Absolutely horrible",3,1,4
"hyperactive, swelling of feet sleepiness",3,3,1

"When I started this I had bee on several others for a month at a time with limited results. My Dr. started me on this and the first 2 weeks I almost gave up but I stayed with it. I am taking 5-20. BP when starting was 140-160-/95-105. I check it daily in the morning and after 6 weeks I am 115-125/70-80, which is remarkable. Only side affects I have noticed are some face flushing which has subsided to once in a awhile and feet swelling. The swelling seems to still be with me but they do not bother me at all. I would have to say at this point the benefits outweight any minor side affects.",4,4,4
"does not bring blood pressure down to normal, still runs high.",4,3,3
"I just started on pill. was taking another pill that made legs swell.. this doesn't. BUT ! since I'm on it,had cough,sneezing... will go Dr. on !7th.. to see if it's the pill.  ",5,2,4
I was taking the 10/40 strength early in the morning and began to have intense dizzy spells thru mid mornings and noon.  The Doctor split the dossage to 5/20 twice a day and still have occasional spell but not as many or intense.,5,3,5
"I'm 39, male. I've had hpb since I was late teen. I've tried all sorts of meds and combos. I've been on Azor for about 5-6weeks now. I've also never really suffered some of the awful symptoms I'm seeing on here on any med outside of having ED, maybe a little weight gain (which I cannot say was from previous BP meds or diet). Most meds have not worked well keeping me around 130-140/85-100. So far on Azor, I've noticed a big difference. My BP is about 125-132/75-85. So, that's good. I can feel it. I'll have my wife watch for hair loss/weight gain which would suck. However, the ONE effect I'm having (not sure if it's the med) is loose stool, in fact (sorry to be gross) when I workout or even sitting at work, can feel it just ""leak"". I know that's gross, but it's something I've just noticed occuring daily lately and am not sure if it's connected to Azor. Nobody else has mentioned it on here. I'd like to know if someone can relate.",5,3,4
No side effects so far I feel better after taking this medication,5,4,3

"10/40...Really bad headaches,frequent urination at night,swelling of ankles and heart palpitations. Feels like i'm running a marathon. Dr. put me on this after my insistance to be taken off Tekturna/ Coreg. The coreg was like toxic waste in my body, and gained 40# in 15 months. Now seems as though Azor is NO better. Don't know what to tell doc, pretty sure all this stuff is the same. Like a previous poster, I'd rather suffer the heart attack and get it over with.",4,1,4
I have terrible coughing attacks along with severe acid issues.,5,1,1
My Dr. put me on Azor 5/20 for bp that was running 199/110.  It has helped to lower some but still running between 160/100 and 158/96. Haven't had any real side effects with this dosage but when I go back for next visit I am going to ask if we need to up dosage or try something else to get my bp down to a more acceptable range.,5,3,3
i get light=headed and very sleepy,5,4,3
"Azor seems to work very well altho it took about two weeks to get to 120/70 from 165/95. I take 5/20mg. Effects I don't like are swelling of my hands, I can no longer wear most of my rings, and itching, burning and numbness of my right upper thigh. If I stop the Azor for a couple of days the symptoms go away. When I restart it comes back. If I take it every other day the burning and numbness stays mimimal,but if I take it every day the burning becomes very intense especially at night. I am convinced that the meralgia paresthetica is caused by the Azor because of the swelling of tissue that it causes. I also noticed urinary urgency when taking everyday that goes away with reduced dosage. I think the tissue swelling that Azor causes is at the root of all my symptoms. I see the doctor next week, will probably have to switch again. ",5,3,5
"I have been taking Azor for 5 days, BP up and down but pulse rate very rapid, over 110. I have been on beta blockers, ace inhibators (about coughed myself to death) now this. How long should it take to see result? BP goes from 125/70 to 145/92",5,3,3

"Well I have been on Azor 10/20 since December. So far my blood pressure has come down and is rather consistent now.  However, living in the Southwest, the sensitivity to the sun is high.  I highly recommend sunblock, hats, and staying out of direct sunlight.  In the past, I have only lightly tanned.  The senstivity has gotten so bad that I really burned at a weekend event (and it's only March - not even close to summer highs and heat!).  I have also noticed slight weight gain.  I have also noticed that I seem to have less energy than before.",4,3,4

"I tried Exforge in two different doses and it didn't work well and I started losing my hair.  As a female, this was pretty scary.  My Doctor put me on 5-20 of Azor and it has worked extremely well for my blood pressure and the hair loss has definitely slowed down.  I would like to try something else to prevent the hair thing, but maybe all the blood pressure drugs may have the same effect.  I'm going to discuss this with my Doctor.",5,4,5
Was able to lower blood pressure fast. Does cause ED problems. Will stick with it for now.,5,4,4
I had been on Diovan for approx. 2 years and couldn't get my blood pressure below the 145-175 range. The Azor has kept my blood pressure at about 135/73 consistenly. I do experience dizziness when rising from a seated position. I usually stand still for a moment to balance myself.,5,4,4
i'm having tingling and burning feet and want to know if its drug related,5,4,4
BP was running really high over past 2 mo and doctor tried several different meds. AZOR 10/40 dropped BP but now it sometimes gets way too low 80/40.  Went to new doctor today after loosing confidence in my previous doctor and they changed med to 5/40.  Sure hope it helps.  Been having lots of chest pains and numbenss/burning sensations in left leg and arm along with heart rate racing 130-150 range at rest only to have it drop to normal a short time later.,4,2,3
"Was on HCTZ for several years but pressure began to creep upward. New doc put me on Azor 5/20 which lowered it some but not enough. Upped dosage to 5/40 and pressure came down into the desired range. Experienced swelling of ankles and feet, so doc rx'd HCTZ 25mg which I take in the a.m. while taking the Azor in the p.m. Other side effects: some dizziness (went away when switched to p.m. dosage, swelling of ankles and feet, tingling/numbness in upper right leg, undesired weight gain (was not warned about this), bothersome dry cough, propensity toward upper respiratory infections, decreased libido and increase in E.D. symptoms. The overall rating is positive for the desired results: lower BP.",5,4,5

"Azor is a good medicine to help lower blood pressure.  I liked it because it was 2 meds in one.  It kept my bp low.  The only problems I had with it was swelling of feet and ankles.  I have stopped it because of cost, but I think I might have to go back on it, because I don't like the side effects of the other drugs the dr is trying on me.  It did make me feel tired though, but I can handle that.",5,5,5
"It took two weeks for a noticeable drop from 160/95 to 130/80. I take 5/20 once a day.

Sick to stomach, general overall yucky feeling. I was taken off this drug immediately when I called the Dr office on Monday AM. ",4,1,1

I have had EKG'S done, stress test...etc...The side effects don't happen everyday but they have happened enough.

Since taking Azor my blood pressure has come down to 120 to 130 over 70 to 80, however if I continue taking my pill every day, my pressure drops drastically, as low as 80 over 60. This drop has me really concerned and if I don't take a pill for three or four days, my pressure will remain around 125 over 75. I don't understand why my pressure fluctuates so much using Azor 50.",2,2,2

"This medication did lower my blood pressure, however it gave me flu like symptoms and made me very sick.  The same as with Amlopodine,  I developed a deep wet cough.  I became so sick, I was bedridden, before I could get it out of my system and be done with it. Thankfully, I have a doctor that listened to me and didn't jerk me around when I identified the cause of my flu-like symptoms.  In fact, he said he has seen this before and stopped the Azor that day. It takes up to 2 weeks for it leave the bloodstream and the flu like symptoms to go away.  Doctor had to give me a steroid shot and a B-12 shot to help me get up out of bed, I have felt so poorly from Azor! Symptoms are not worth it!  I'd rather kill over with a heart attack than have the flu the rest of my life!  Just being dramatic here, in case any  passion of my fury was missed!  :) My doctor has asked me to try Divoan HCT.

I have had some mild effects on my GI tract, but not to the point where I would give up this medication.

Do not take this drug.  It can kill you.  Why it has not been taken off the market is inexcusable.  About 1200 pending lawsuits.  Why our system allows pharmas to kill people is horrrendous.,5,1,1

To date, I am happy to report that all is well.",5,5,5
"this med made me feel worse than about any other I have taken for my BP.  Within about a half hour of taking it, it felt like all my muscles had been overworked and fatigued.  I also felt very tense and edgy.  It also didn't control my BP as I had readings ranging from 270/140 to 224/114.  So my doc has recently changed that med.  I personally wouldn't recommend it.",3,1,1

Body aches, runny nose feeling like I had a flu with body aches stuffed nose etc. Makes your pee smell. My whole body feels like it is being compacted and crushed. Do not take this medicine.

"I am diabetic and my physician prescribed it as a preventative for high blood pressure, although it has never been high. Almost immediately after starting it my family started getting very frustrated with me having short term memory problems. It got worse and worse rapidly to the point that I couldn't remember how to do routine tasks at work and home. I honestly thought I was rapidly developing early Alzheimers. They insisted I schedule a dr. appointment and discuss the situation. He said it wasn't a reported side effect, but I discontinued using the drug and within three days I was back to my old self with no more memory problems. Clearly it was caused by the Benicar because it was the only change I made.",1,1,1

Beginning today no more of this poison is going into my body!  ",3,2,3
I have tried all my life to avoid doctors and medication but at the age of 43 had to begin treating high BP. Tried two other meds. little or no positive results. Benicar has maintained BP at very good levels at low dosage with zero side effects. I don't recommend taking drugs but if it's absolutely necessary I would recommend this one.,5,5,5

" Benicar was the 3rd ARB my doctor prescribed when I developed a cough from lisinopril. With each successive script, my blood pressure increased until it reached 179/106. I felt horrible, my heart pounded and urination decreased. I had only been on benicar one week. I saw the PA and said I would go back to lisinopril despite the cough. After 3 days my BP was back to 131/80. Apparently, ARBs are contraindicated for me, but I don't know what actually happened. No more ARBs for me.",1,1,1

"Works perfectly without any noticeable side/adverse effects.  I buy olmesartan medoxomil (generic, exactly the same as Benicar) made by Macleods a reputable world class manufacturer in India where most of the world's drugs (generic or branded) are made for about $15 per month which is one half of what my insurance co-pay would be.  This is another example of America's broken, plunder for profit medical/pharma system.  Note: The last time I bought Benicar it came as loose pills in a non-airtight bottle.  The generic from India comes in identified high-quality blister packs.  Just another example of how broken or pharms system is.   I am both a caretaker and a patient, I take BP's dozens and sometimes a hundred times a week--when I switched from Benicar to generic------no change.  It's the real thing.  ",5,5,5

I was on same drug years ago stopped due to side effects of making me tired. I tried some others with mixed results. I am now back on 20 MG 1x daily I weight 265 lbs and I am 52 years old. almost 4 hours later I am out like someone turned off a switch. I it scary if their was a house fire I would not know or could not get out.  I also now have noticed GI problems and cant help to wonder if Benicar is the cause of my GI issues. ,1,2,3
I have been taking Benicar for 5+ years now. I am very happy with how well the drug is doing. I was taking 20 mg for the first few years but I have been able to cut back to 10 mg with the same results. I haven't had any noticeable side effects like I did with some of the drugs I tried before this one. I'm am happy consumer!,5,5,5
Alleviated the chronic cough from previous Blood Pressure medication.,5,5,5
Have been taking Benicar for several years. Have had no side effects. It has controlled my blood pressure along with a diuretic and potassium.Very pleased with this medication. It is a little expensive and my insurance doesn't like it but will not change.,5,5,5
Only problem I have taking Benicar is making me sleepy most of the time and some lethargic. Blood pressure is good when I visit my doctor. First time in long long time trying other b/p meds.,4,4,4
I recently switched from Lisinipril to Benicar. This has helped me with less phlem and cough. I am very satisfied with the results.,5,5,4
Been on this med for the past 8 years. In the beginning I felt light headed when rising from a sitting position. That side effect has long past. My blood pressure is normal every time it is checked at the Dr office or when I check it at home.,5,5,5
"I tried several BP meds, all of them made me light headed. SO light headed that it scared me. I had to choose between dizziness or high blood pressure. THEN, I tried Benicar. I've been taking 20mg twice per day for a few years and not only has it controlled my blood pressure very well, I've had ZERO side effects. For me personally, It's been great. Other drugs I've tried were intolerable.",5,5,5

I have been on Benicar for 10 years now and my blood pressure is normal now.  No side effects. ,5,5,5
I have had no side effects.,4,5,4
Have been taking it for 8 years with no problems.  Blood pressure is always controlled.  Have been on blood pressure meds for 30 years; None have worked as well as this one.  Now my insurance is not going to pay for this med anymore. Am scared to death to try something else. Have had atrial fib; Am worried that the other meds side effects of rapid heart beat and pounding heart rate will make me go back into A Fib.  I feel this insurance change is a result of Obamacare.  Not happy with this change. ,5,5,5
"I began (last night) to take 40 mg Benicar, after d/c Toprol due to the cardio problems, and Lisinopril, though I have had no side effects from it at all.  I have SLEPT THE DAY AWAY TODAY.  I AM EXHAUSTED.  HOWEVER, I do understand that I need to give my body a chance to adjust, but still, I can barely stay awake!  I wanted to stop beta blockers because I like to exercise (I go to a gym, lift weights, and have tried to do some cardio but that is the main reason why I wanted to stop beta blockers.) Anyway, I also noticed that my sinuses are very unhappy, like they used to be when I used Fentanyl patches for chronic pain.  interesting how fast a drug can cause side effects.  If this fatigue continues for more than three more days, I will stop this drug.  I also had to point out to my doc the fact that i have high potassium blood levels.  Otherwise, he would have blindly gone on without doing labs.  One must take control of one's health!  Do NOT leave it to doctors, no matter how much you like them.",5,3,3

"Had been on this for 10 years. Then Insurance took it off their ""Formuulary"" Drugs that are covered! Changed to medication after medication. None did the trick & resulted in side effects. This year insurance has on ""Formulary"" & my co-pay is managable. My readings are back to 120/80. I have taken BP Meds since I was 32 & I am 71 now.

Called Dr. who said, "" You haven't been on it long enough.  Keep taking it and if you have chest pain, go to the hospital.  NOT.

First the hip pain, then I think I had an allergic reaction and the muscle pain in my left arm was so severe and painful...it wore me down.  I couldn't move my arm and this is 4 days after last dose, even further, my thumb is numb today (4 days later). Went to physical therapist today and going back tomorrow.

"I had numerous major side effects with name brand.Benicar   effects: choking, cough, thick throat, back ache (area of kidneys), decreased urine despite fluid intake, swollen ankles, aching bones,. Benicar contains sulphonamide, (I'm allergic to sulfa drugs). Recent lab results showed major increased triglycerides, cholesterol(s), etc. as in DANGEROUS.   Until it became unavailable I took 10 mg Lotensin (name brand) because I had horrible side effects with the generic Benzapril when it came on the market. After a couple of months I reported the adverse side effects and my doctor began writing ""Do Not Substitute"".  I NEVER had a single side effect or adverse incident with the Brand name Lotensin.    My humble opinion is that Some Generic medications are DANGEROUS and should never be prescribed.  Many pharmacies default to generics automatically substituting until you call their attention to the ""Do Not Substitute"" and after commenting on the notation on the prescription have been told we do not sell name brand.  ""If you want to purchase the bottle of 100 tablets we'll get it for you"".",1,1,1

New doctor told me that Benicar had done permanant damage to venous return in legs and would have chronic swelling in legs. this was 10 years ago and I now have to take diuretics to control swelling. also, hsve venous dermatitis due to chronic swelling. wish I had changed to a doctor that listened to me sooner.

Light nagging headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, numbing of arms, tingling of feet and hands and once my face went numb. Feeling like I am having a heartattack mostly in the middle of the night when I wake up and I have shortness of breath and numbing arm then palpatations and sweating. Very scary. The diziness has gotten worse and it is taking a toll on my quality of life, I am exhausted. The only thing I have done differently since I started Benicar is I began an excercise program about a month ago. walking and weights, this is when I began noticing the side effects so I thought maybe I didnt need as much of a dose so I cut in half. Blood pressure went up..... confused about why I am having side effects now, but I am having what everyone else is having on this site. Kind of a delayed reaction but a scary ones. Also feeling very paniced all the time. Have doc appt on Monday and plan to discuss trying something else. I hate it because it controlled my blood pressure.

I went to my doctor thinking I caught something at the gym or elsewhere.  She could not figure it out.  I went to her 3 times before I was sent to a dermatologist.  That doctor looked up the side effects of Benicar and found it does cause break outs on the skin. Once I stopped taking it, then my rash began to go away.  Of course I changed medication. I am not taking Diovan and all is well. Check side effects of  medication(s) you are taking.  ",5,1,1

I have been taking Benicar 20 MG along with HCT 25MG for about 17 months now.  Today 7/27/2011 was the first time I experienced severe dizziness to almost passing out (it is over 95 degrees outside). My BP was 126/64. I dialed 911 but hung up because the condition subsided after I lied down for about 15 minutes.  I am so glad I was not traveling on Subway or Bus today. Overall it is very successfull in lowering my BP (140/90 to 126/76)  ,4,4,4
"I take 20 mg/day and of all the B.P. meds I've been on, Benicar has been most effective in lowering my pressure. Unfortunately, after almost 2 years I'm having B.P.readings almost too low, dizziness, headache, muscle & joint pain, itching and rashes when exposed to sun. When my pressure drops to 95/58, I just wilt and, if not actually, come near to passing out. No insurance right now as husband was laid off. ",5,3,5

"I agree with Fairbanks that Bystolic in combo with Benicar is very effective in controlling BP..sometimes too effective. The side effects of sun sensitivity ,ED and fatigue are tough to take, but workable at this point.",5,4,5
"In combination with Bystolic, Benicar has been the most effective of the many medicines I've tried to lower my blood pressure over the past 15 years. Happily, my BP is now at a very acceptable level. The one distressing side effect is that the Benicar has caused a pronounced intolerance for sun. Even short amounts of exposure will cause extreme itching and permanent discoloration of the affected skin. The itchy skin seems to be getting progressively worse every summer that I'm exposed to sunlight (thank goodness I live in Alaska and have 8 months of winter!).",5,4,5
"I tried 2 other HBP drugs that had too many side effects.  Benicar's only side effect on me was a slight effect on my equilibrium.  Otherwise, I haven't noticed anything.",5,5,5

Side effects I experiences are, joint and muscle pain, weakness and stiffness and cramps in legs and arms(felt like the muscles were going to break),irregular heart beat.  Origionally had feeling that I couldn't swallow but that went away after a couple of months.  I try not to read the symptons so I don't imagine I have them but glad I finally read and see I have the same reaction that I had with lisinopril.

"I am currently on Benicar 5mg which works well for me but, lately I have been light headed and headache (had recent Ct and it was normal) could this be a side effect of this med?

"I have suffered no ill effects from this medicine. I take 20 mg daily. So far no interactions with other meds. I don't take any other BP or cardiac meds, just for MS. I have been taking benicar for about 6 years and so far so good",5,5,5

Every now and then an occasional migrane headache. Overall I still like this drug. I found that daily cardio exercise is the key to any sluggishness and fatique. Side effects to Benicar appear to be minimal to none. I wish it were more affordable. Even with insurance the co-pay is way too high. ",5,5,5
I have been taking this medication about 3 yrs.  My main concern is itching.  I have little blisters that itch alot.  I also have a cough at night.,5,3,3

I have been on this medication for 4 years. At the beginning I had very serious dizziness and vertigo. That has subsided. However for the last 4 months I have been sufering from sexual dysfunction. My doctor wants to blame my age and menopause. Any drug can have a cumulative effect. Maybe it is time to change doctors....,4,3,4
"My 100 mg. daily Metoprolol that I had taken 2X a day  for 30 years stopped working for my high b.p. Doc prescribed one drug after another to take with the Metoprolol and all gave bad side effects including water pills I could not tolerate. He put me on Benicar a very expensive ARB class drug - one of the newer meds.  It is currently a popular b.p. drug supposed to keep strokes from occurring and good for diabetics. (I am not a diabetic). What I experienced the entire month on this drug was an absolute NIGHTMARE and CHANGE IN PERSONALITY.  At first I slept soundly in several naps a day, morning afternoon and night - got very little done, but sleep was sound! Then the sleepiness morphed into NO APPETITE, could hardly get food down and lost 10 lbs that month as a result. VISION difficult to focus, and the WORST WERE THE HEART PALPITATIONS AND MENTAL AFFECTS. I COULD NOT FOCUS MY MIND, SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS, NO AMBITION - APATHY IN WHAT WAS GOING ON around me. CREATIVITY was squelched! Felt like a zombie! This is the worst b.p. med I have ever taken. And the 20 mg. pill only brought down my b.p. moderately - 150 over 100 - not goal!  Yesterday, I pleaded doctor to take me off this poison - he did. Now I am starting on Clonidine - so far so good! What a relief! Praying this one works out in less side effects as time goes on. If you take Benicar be sure to monitor it closely as perhaps these side effects could sneak up on you as they did me! Shameful big pharma for letting this one on the market!",2,5,2
At first my blood pressure would be sky high and i would fax my doctor the results every three hours.  She told me to just continue taking which i did my bp has gone down a lot compare to 159/97 now its 120/80 or below.  ,4,5,5

"It worked to bring my blood pressure down, but always feeling run down and achy.  And YES to Dolly, my last batch has a funny smell to it, almost like a sweat/sour smell.  Now I see the cholesterol thing, got appointment with Doc and thanks to switching insurance plans, Benicar is on a higher tier, so cost is to high, so will be switching. ",4,2,4
"I wrote a review just last week after finding that Benicar had raised my cholesterol over 100 points in less than a year.  I also found that there was foot pain associated with taking this drug.  I've been off of it 1 week now, and the foot pain is gone!  The dr has me on Diovan now, so hopefully my cholesterol numbers will go back down to normal.  The Mayo Clinic web site lists the hypercholesterolism (large amounts of fat in the blood) as a rare side effect they found in clinical trials.  So,  please get your cholesterol checked often if you are taking Benicar, and beware of foot pain- it's probably also from the Benicar!",4,1,4
"Became VERY, VERY tired while taking this drug. Also sweat alot. The last couple of bottles(used mail order drug company for this medicine)had a very strange odor. Was wondering if anyone else had notice this strange odor coming from their medication or maybe there was something wrong with the medicine I received. Could explain my severe fatigue. Worst feeling I have ever had. No longer taking this. Would not recommend anyone taking Benicar. Felt so bad I would rather risk a heart attack than take Benicar and deal with the fatigue.",5,1,3

"I thought Benicar was doing a good job- my BP was back in an acceptable range, after several other BP meds raised my readings or caused swelling.  Then I had my cholesterol checked on a routine physical.  After 8 months on Benicar, my cholesterol readings increased by 101 points!!  I've always had very low cholesterol readings, now it's at 218!!  And now I'm reading about the side effects others are having, and realizing that the pain in my feet, legs and joints may be from the Benicar as well.  Maybe also the recent heart burn- I've never had that before.  It started out just fine, but am calling the Dr about the Benicar -cholesterol connection.  Any one else have that problem??",4,3,4
I have been on Benicar for high blood pressure for over 5 years now and I've been very happy with it.  I take 20mg 1x day and it works fine.  The only problem that I have with this medicine is that I have lots of night sweats.  I will wake up during the night and I'm soaked as if I had just ran a marathon.  I was once taken off this medicine and I got VERY ill!  I have never tried that again with my doctor.  I am very pleased!,5,4,4

"Seems to have lowered BP over last 3 years of 40 mg daily but this last year, foot pain, joint pain, muscle ache, and lower back pain.  Asked dr to go off it and see if these issues go away.

In 6/2010 I decrease my BP Med by half and my BP has remain within the same readings as if I was taking the full dose. Diet and exercise does help to reduce your BP. After a work out mine has droped as low as 74/56. Also since i stared working out I have been able to drop my weight by 45lbs. My goal is to drop another 25lbs and then try and go without my BP Med for a bit to see how I handle that. Yes I still like to eat at the buffets :-) from time to time, but I keep that in check by working out. I have been able to work myself up do doing 6 miles total on the summit and eliptical machine combined in one sesson(1.5 hours). I work out 3-5 days aweek.

"I was on Benicar 40 (for 2 wks), then reduced to 20 for 3 weeks and I truly believe that Benicar is responsible for the onset of Panic Attacks (never had prior).  I'm off the Benicar now, but my side effects were so bad that I spent 3 weeks not able to get out of the bed.  Sore throat, lost 13 pounds, muscle aches, heavy limbs, general fatique, dizziness, inconsistent BP with some major drops.  Went to the ER twice with 2 of the more intense panic attacks.  Been off that med (now on lisinipril) for about 2 1/2 months, but I still don't feel 100% myself or well and think I've hung on to some of the anxiety.  I would never recommend this drug and wish that I'd never taken it.",5,1,3
"I had to drop down from 20mg to 10 mg because my BP was too low.  Now I am finding after 2 months that it is not staying down in the afternoon.  I will discuss taking 10 mg in am and 10 mg in pm.  Also, being a person with chronic anxiety, it has increased my anxiety 100% - back to where it was unmanagable when I was 15.  My doctor does not want to change it because she thinks it is not affecting my anxiety.  I may switch doctors.  You have to be your own advicate and I know my body.",3,1,3

Started out on 20mg of Benicar and was very light headed and dizzy and so tired I didn't want to get out of bed. My BP dropped too low, so I cut the pills in half and had same effects and same low BP.  So I cut the pills in half again (5mg) and now the BP is stable around 130 over 75.  I did that about 10 days ago. The dizziness and shortness of breath is gone, but I have a dry cough, now.  I am having sore muscles in my feet, but I am not sure that is the Benicar.  I like the lowered BP, and my energy is better on the low dose.  I am going to give this more time and see if the cough persists.  I cough a lot at night! I am in ""wait and see"" mode, but at 5mg, the drug is effective with little in the way of side effects.  If this is like Lisinipril, it will take a few months to discover if there are any persistent side effects.",4,2,4
Have been taking Benicar for about 4 mos.  I have light headiness/dizziness all the time.  Get very hot and sweat profusely.  Cough all during the day and night.  My vision has gotten worse.

The most troubling side effects are extreme dizziness, headaches, increased perspiration, and the feeling of hot flashes. I feel irritable and impatient which is not me. I have always seen the ""glass half full"".  I am seeing my Dr. this week to see if I could cut the dosage.  I have tried taking the meds in the morning and at night with no difference. I do know there is a big difference if I do not take with food. Side effects much worse on an empty stomach.",5,2,5

I take benicar 40 with clonidine twice a day .2.  Clonidine puts me to sleep.  I have had only a little dissiness at times with benicar.  My blood preasure fell from 280/200 to 240/180 or to /180/114 which varies depending on stress.  I have been on benicar for 1 and 1/2 years.  My blood chemistry is better than it ever was and it is helping my kidneys.   The only problem is my Benicar comes from India by way of Canada where it costs me 100 instead of 270 in the us at walmart due to patent problems in the us.  I am a senior and money matters to me,5,3,3
"Started 20mg on 11-12-08 for BP. On 12-9-2008 went to Doc with server cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Diagnosed with Asthma and prescribed prednizone, proventil, levaquin and Advair discus. Treatment worked for about as long as I was taking prednizone. However, as a type II diabetic my sugar level went out of sight.  Returned to Doc and he gave me another round of the same treatment with no better results.  After reading many reviews on the web, I have began to think Benicar could be my problem.  As of today, I will stop taking Benicar and see if the symptoms improve. I thing they will. I don't think my Doc will accept it very well but I am ultimately responsible for what I choose to put in my body and believe this to be a bad drug.  I have never had asthma symptoms in my life until taking this durg and immediately started a severe cough and trouble breathing. I will review later and give the results.",1,1,4

THE JURY IS STILL OUT THOUGH AS I THINK TWO MONTHS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO JUDGE.",5,3,3
"pStarted med in Nov. 2008 and felt good at first since it did lower my bp. As time passed, though, I began to feel various symtoms; a chronic cough, trouble breathing, sinus congestion, headache, neck muscle pain, fatigued/sleepiness. Recently, I went to the Dr. for stomach pains/inflamation, and rectal bleeding.  It tested positive for blood in the stool and a CT Scan was ordered and was shocked to find out I have liver problems among other things, like sugar in the blood, high level of creatinine, and bladder/UTI problems.  None of which I previously had a problem with.  I do not take any other medication on a regular basis, so I attribute these symptoms directly to the Benicar HCT, especially after reading the side effects that coincided with my symptoms and that regretfully I read after the fact. Don't make the same mistake I did, excusing the symptoms with other causes you think it might be.  Always read the contraindications and side effects first, so you can determine early what truly caused you the problems. Consequently, I don't know how all this will turn out for me in the end, but I sure hope that there is no permanent damage to any of my vital organs. I will not be taking this med anymore, that's for sure.",4,1,3
I was diagnosed with moderate high blood pressure (165 over 85).  The cardiologist prescribed Benicar 20mg.  Within a week my bp has receded to 118 over 69.  I monitor  every day and notice an increase if I eat a salty meal or imbibe wine. A heathy diet and exercise along with Benicar seem to work wonders for me.,5,5,5
Controls BP better than Diovan 160mg.  I have had a little dizziness but nothing serious.,5,5,5
"I seem to be a little tired, but not like I use to be.  I was wondering if anyone has experience getting gout while on this medication.",5,5,5
"This is a great medication.  The only problem is - it's very difficult to get my insurance company to pay for this medicine when I need a new prescription.  I have to go through a big process to get my dr. to send in paperwork, then the insurance company has to review it; this can take up to 72-96 hours before I know whether I can get the new prescription.  Why is this so difficult?  I am on Medicare, with diabetes and COPD; also past history of CHF and pulmonary embolism.  I just don't see why this med is so hard for the insurance company to approve.  I have no problem getting the rest of my meds filled, why Benicar!!!!!!!!",5,3,5
"Was on Accupril, but had chronic cough. No cough with Benicar and controls BP better. Now doing 3 months mail order to reduce cost. I bought a automatic BP cuff so I can monitor BP between doctor visits.  It's good biofeedback.  I can see how a salty meal affects my BP.  Can also see how moderate walking helps.  Some sexual issues that I never had before (vaginal dryness, probs with the big ""O""), but not sure if it is age, the meds, or my boyfriend! LOL! :)",3,4,5

"While bending over one morning, I became very dizzy and light headed. I was working in the heat. I had only eaten a danish for breakfast. My b/p was 99/61 when I took it at home. Why did I have hypotension if I suffer from hypertension?",5,4,5

Given hydrocodone (for pain I didn't feel), musinex for my lung congestion. Urine smelled from musinex. Did break up cough. PCP prescribed lisinipril (cough became worse) lowered bp. Stopped it because of cough. Prescribed tessalon for cough and benicar 40mg. Took only 20mg for 3 days, 40mg 1 day. Second day tired and ached like I had the flu. Cough increased. Lost voice when talking. Sinuses filled, drained yukky green mucous, I was cold and sweating at same time, bowel movements changed, headache too. 12 hrs after taking 40mg bp lowered from 200/84 to 160/84. But coughing got worse. Read the pkg insert! Bronchitis is a side affect; flu-like symptoms a side affect; sinus infection a side affect; dizziness a side affect...I'm tired of being a guinea-pig for doctors who either don't know the meds well enough or don't know their patients well enough or dare I say don't care!!! I'm looking for an alternative type of treatment!!! Could some of us have high bp as a normal part of life?! There is no history of heart problems in my family on either side; and I've had all the tests, scans, etc. I think I'm DONE with MD's and prescription meds that do more harm than the disease!",4,1,2

"I was put on this medicine (20mg) 5 months ago and I was able to dramatically lower my blood pressure.  I had no side effects but the medicine is expensive.

just started treatment,3,2,3
Started taking Benicar last Monday for high Blood pressure/ Since taking the med I am sleepy all of the time!!! It is even hard to keep my eyes open while driving!!! Very Scary! Will call doc Monday to get on something else for bp,1,1,3
"Started on an ACE about 3-1/2 years ago.  Started having a cough, and my BP was not controlled.  Was switched to Benicar, and the cough was gone in a little over a week.  I read the posts on this drug, and had to respond.  This drug did what it was suppose to do, lower my blood pressure.  I have not had any side effects and I have been on it for over three years, no kidney issues, fatigue, etc.  In fact this is the best that I have felt in years!  I was a little dizzy at times for the first few days, but my DR told me that is was just the medicine lowering my BP.  He said that it took many years to raise my BP to 180/120, and I was lowering it in a few days.  That would cause the dizziness.  Sure enough in a few days it was gone.  My BP has remained at 117/ 75 for three years.  I can’t ask for anything better.  Yes it is more expensive than a generic.  I pay $20 a month.  Ask your DR for samples, they will give them to you each visit.  For me the $10 increase in cost, over the generic, far outweighs the side effects.  As far as the people that have crazy side effects, and stop taking the medicine, and within a day or a few hours they are gone, I don’t think it was the medicine.  These drugs take weeks to get into you system, and weeks to get out.  Even after you stop taking them.  Maybe it was all in your head, or was it something your friends at the local Bingo parlor told you that they experienced, and now you have it to.  The mind is a powerful drug in its own right!  Give the medicine and chance, and let it do what it is suppose to do.  I read that one lady said that her husband lost his libido on this drug.  Viagra, and the other ED drugs are failed BP drugs.  This drug should help his little soldier stand at attention as she said.  If you do research on this drug, you will find that it fights the hormone that constricts the veins.  If more blood is flowing to parts of the body, then…  Think about it!  Good luck with this drug, you will not be disappointed! A++",5,5,5
"2/9/09---71 yrs old---In very good health---On 10mg of Benicar every morning for 5 years now (only drug taken)--- No serious problems for 1st 4+ years, and then started gradually having strange apparent side effects----lips and tongue would alternately swell up BIG every few weeks; fatigue leading to naps (I never took naps before Benicar); joint pain in knees; very sore throat and loss of voice which lasted for weeks; new acid-reflux started; vision has become blurry; mild depression and anxiety; and finally small red itchy rashes formed on soft-tissue of underarms, crotch, buttochs and belly, alternating from week to week. Doctor (and I) could not find ANY reason for all these maladys! Blood pressure did drop from 140/90 to normal (or below) while on drug----but I decided that side effects were not worth it, so quit the drug 5 days ago----will see what happens---blood pressure has remained stable and normal, so far (I monitor closely). Not positive that drug is causing all these problems, but have no other explanation as I have never had any of these problems before Benicar.  I am not on any other drugs. Very suspicious, to say the least. Pretty scary.  ",4,2,4
"After trying several other BP medications, I have been on Benicar for a year.  I initially had dizziness.  Over the past 4 months, I have developed horrible muscle fatigue, tingling and numbness in my arms and sometimes my legs & feet, blurred vision and terrible shortness of breath.  Not sure what to do now.  My doc is very thorough but feels I must stay on this med.  I did not have any of these issues prior to this med.  I have also noticed weight gain and anxiousness.  Is there ANY natural dietary supplements that are proven to work with less side affects?  ",3,1,3

I have tingling in fingers, especially at night, very low BP at times- like 85/55, dizziness and almost fainting at times when getting up, very low sexual desire and erectile problems.

"I've been on this medicine for two years without any side effects except I do get a racing heart once in a while especially after drinking home brewed tea or coffee. If I do any hard exercise in the morning within a couple hours of taking it, I will get dizzy.  It's done me fine.",5,5,5
"some side effects including weakness, fatigue, inability to get an erection but the 40/12.5 dosage definetly got my bp under control and then some. Therefore all in all it does what it is meant to do so I can't fault it.",5,3,5

I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in the summer of 2006.  My average BP readings at that time were approximately 170/110.  After being prescribed several medications that were ineffective my doctor prescribed Benicar which did lower my BP.    I initially experienced dizziness and hazy vision as my body adjusted to the medication as well as ED issues.  Later on I began to experience numbness / tingling in my face and extremities difficulty berating lightheadedness and an intense feeling that I was about to pass out and the end was near.  These episodes landed me in the emergency room twice prior to me learning how to bear them patiently.   I have put up with the side effects for one year now and just today (1/5/09) I have requested that my doctor find me a different medication.  I am a little nervous about this decision because Benicar did lower my BP but I can no longer bare the side effects.,4,2,4
I have been using 10 mg Benicar for 4 months for high bp. I have recently started getting cough/shortness of breath if I miss a dose. Is cough a common side effect if a dose is missed? I have not felt any other side effects except that I need to take a nap during the day without which I cannot function properly. Has anyone who takes benicar noticed any weight gain ot loss while on it?,4,3,4

"I have taken Benicar for about 3 years now and my biggest complaint is when I first started taking it, I had the worst headaches you could amagine. and tired. but it passes in about 2 weeks. If you can hang in there.",1,3,4
I began treatment for high blood pressure with Lisinopril.  I had a dry cough that kept me up at night after taking the med for approx 2-3 months.  Benicar has been much better and I feel great.,5,5,5
"After first starting this medication I developed significant heartburn, a severe cough and some itching.  The Dr. felt that the cough and itching may have been an interaction with the Pepcid Complete I was taking to treat the heartburn.  I now take the 20mg Benicar at night before bed and a Prilosec OTC first thing in the morning with a glass of water 30 minutes before breakfast and the coughing, itching and heartburn side effects have all gone away.  However, I do get some muscle cramps in my calves with exercise.  I have also noticed a loss of libido and had not thought about Benicar as a possible cause until reading some of the other reviews.  This may be an additional side effect that I just found out about.",3,4,5
I felt dizzy when I first started taking it. I also felt very lethargic for the first 8 hours after taking it. Now I take it in the evening and I feel much better during the day (not so tired).,5,4,5

I was taking Cozaar for years and I had good results.  I retired and couldn't pay the price.  My doctor changed me to Benicar at my request which is 1/2 the cost of Cozaar.  Not a good move.  I have a chronic cough and so much itching skin.  I will trim the dose to 10MG and see if that works for me.  Otherwise adios to Benicar and I'll have to pay for Cozaar as there is no generic.  This website really helps.,4,2,4

"40 mg for HBP 2 years on it. No hair loss.  4 other types of meds before this, all with side effects.  This one is effective.  All HBP lowering meds seem to have fatigue and dizziness side effects...that's something to be expected.  Others here seem to attribute unusual side effects to this drug.  IMO, likely something else is causing the far-fetched symptoms.  All react differently, but, the science does not support what is alleged here by others.",5,4,4

Took 20 mg for two weeks.  Blood pressure was not that good.  Dr. told me to take 20 mg twice a day.  I took one extra dose and felt sick.  I was dizzy and had a headache.

I take the Benicar at bed time and after awhile I feel cold and don't know if my system temp. gets too low?  Heart rate skips like flip flops but I change breathing and its settle down.

However, I do notice the muscle/joint pain, although it improves throughout the day, but mornings are rough. I thought I had lost sexual desire because of the pain, but perhaps it's another side effect as well. Would love to know if taking it every OTHER day might help.",5,3,5

I have been taking this medication for 2 months.  The 2 side effects that I notice are being tired most of the time and sleepy most of the time.  I can get 7-8 hours of sleep a night and I am still tired and sleepy most of the day.  This may cause me to have to switch to a different BP medication.  It did lower my BP from 140/95 to 110/64 though.  I still cannot handle being this tired and sleepy every day.  ,4,2,3

Some side affects: decreases sex desire and ability; standing up quickly on golf course...my head spins if sun is out and hot; I feel like I am going to black out.  Decreases your energy level. If you drink too much alcohol, it causes your heart rate to increase while you sleep.  If I get off this medicine, my BP goes right back up.  Even though I am taking it now...higher in the a.m.(165/90),  after the morning BP reduces to(140/80). I take the BP medicine in the a.m.  My experience w/ Benicar has been good, but there are a lot of negatives.  I wish I could get off all BP medicine.  I don't think it is good for anyone over the long-term. ",4,3,4

"   When I first read some of these reviews I wasn't so sure that I wanted to take this med, but I gave it a try.    This is the 3rd med since Dec 07 and I finally have one that WORKS without any noticable or unwelcome side effects. My readings are nice & low and STAY that way. With some of the other drugs my readings fluctuated so much from shortly after I took it to 12 or 16 hours later. It seemed like it only worked short term, not the full 24 hours.    One (Lisinopril) left me with dry coughing spells that were so bad I was coughing up blood from the strain. The other (Diovan) caused a 10lb weight gain to my midsection and unacceptable elevated liver enzymes for which I underwent more testing. Once I stopped the med, my enzymes went back to normal.    Hopefully, I have come to the correct medication for me. The results so far have been good. Now I just hope it stays that way.",5,5,5

A few days later diarrhea began, continued now for 11 DAYS, with very strange ""medicinal"" smell.  I feel it is the Benicar, since I NEVER have diarrhea until starting this med. It does work VERY well in controlling B/P but I CANNOT tolerate this daily diarrhea---interfering with work and electrolytes!  Dr out of town until Tues but will tell her I want off this med---diarrhea not a tolerable side effect for me.

Been battling high triglycerides for most of time on it despite taking statin.  They were fine before drug.  Side effects are not worth it and it is too expensive.

My preasure is now 180/140.  It is just staying there after a freefall that was scary.  I can not get the bottom to go down so the top can go down.

What causes this and I feel totally helpless and alone.,4,1,3

After reading some reviews about reported liver problems, I will address this with my physician.  Am awaiting new blood results. I appreciate other reviews stating they have reduced their mg dosage.  I will address that with my physician, too.  I always experience increased urination w/ this, but not too bad - controllable.",5,5,5

I went back to the doctor several times about my heel, had it x-rayed and was told I have a small spur.(Not bad enough to cause so much pain) I asked her to change my bp medication.  Less than a week and all pain was gone.  2 1/2 months later back pain is back.  Heel is not bad. My doctor is working with me to try to find BP med that does not cause joint pain.  And I know that I have some problems with joints, but bp meds exacerbates it so much that I often wake up in tears.",5,1,4

I have taken Benicar since 2002 for hypertension. It seems to work well to keep my blood pressure fairly stable. Recently though the insurance company has made it very difficult to receive this drug because they want people on Benicar to take a generic replacement. My doctor claims there is none and we need to continue on this one. My husband takes it also. The main drawback is that it is quite expensive.,5,5,5

"I was on the drug for 1 year and it helped reduce my blood pressure. However I developed severe diarrea that hospitalized me with dehydration. Doctors never could diagnose the cause, however I feel my body was reacting to the Benicar. I got off the Benicar for approx. 10 days. Once out of the hosiptal, I took 1 Flagyl and my Benicar. I developed  severe vomiting that I blamed on Flagyl even though I had no alcohol. After this no Benicar or Flagyl. Then I decided to take my Benicar again as I thought Flagyl was the problem. This time the same reaction to the Benicar 2 hours after taking it- sweating, vomiting, shortness of breath. This time I blamed it on my 6 year olds virus. No more Benicar for about 4 weeks, until I decide to take it again thinking ther is no way the Benicar is making me sick after using it for over 1 year with no problem.

"Really, I'm writing to let people know that unless they have a DOCTORATE in Medicine be id cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, pulmonary, or general medicine, they shouldn't decrease their medications on their own.  If your doctor doesn't listen to you, then keep stressing to him/her what ALL of the symptoms are.  If you're not telling them EVERYTHING then they can not accurately diagnose a disease or condition.  If you can't remember then keep a symptom journal of what happened a certain day, and if you feel like being extremely accurate, put in times like when you took your medication(s) then any symptoms/side effects later on.  If you give a generalization of ""an hour"" or ""two hours"" when it was only 40 minutes, it would make a difference in the diagnosis.  The patient probably said too long of a time had passed for the doctor (who is really really smart and knows a LOT about medicine) to have connected the two.  If a more accurate time had been given, then there's no doubt in my mind that the doctor would have connected the side effects and the pill.  Why do people think they're so much smarter than their doctors when a doctor doesn't know what you're feeling and is relying on repsonses from you to make a decision about the probablility of a condition.  DOCTORS ARE SMART, BUT THEY ARE NOT PSYCHICS!",5,5,5
"The daily dosage recommended by my cardiologist was extremely high (40mg) and has caused me to have severe problems such as: 1. Plunging Blood pressure readings (70/50) during only minor excertions (such as petting my dog). 2. Severe dizziness and inability to breathe). 3. Unable to stand and fainting.  The doctor denied that the medication he prescribed was the cause of my problems and gave me all kinds of tests for equilibrium and stress. They all proved negative. While he was scratching his head, I (on my own) reduced the daily benicar dosage to 5 mg and added 4 mg of cardura. This was 6 months ago and I can now do almost any task without any problems.Also my blood pressure averages 140/80. By the way, my wife has the same problems with the same doctor and drug but has only changed her doctor so far. My experience tells me that the drug can be effective if the dose is kept very low.

Have taken Losartan and Losartan HCTZ that I have outgrown, my body got immuned to them I think.  Then I was prescribed w/ Benicar HCT 40mg/25mg.  On the 4th day taking this benicar, while playing basketball, I experienced leg cramping like I had when I first started on Losartan HCTZ.  I checked my BP that night, had a lowest reading of 101/52. I felt some mild lightheadedness but felt OK overall.  But on the 6th day of taking this Benicar, I experienced a very severe cramping while playing basketball which started from my thighs up to my torso!  Driven home by a friend, cramps continued at home and in dire agony I asked my wife to take me to the hospital.  In the ER I was given intravenous rehydration and after 4hrs was released.  I know very well and I had muscle cramps before but that time it was so severe that really frightened the hell out of me, I could not breathe because almost my whole body except from the neck up were cramping alternately.  I am kind of pain tolerant but it was so severe cramping and pain that I have never experienced before.  It was like a very bad nightmare that still frightens me up to now (happened 4days ago while writing this review), I thought I was already having ""rigor mortis"" while still alive =), also that experience kinda changed something in me I could not explain or maybe I just have not yet fully recovered from what happened.

After 5 weeks I ended up in the emergency room severely dehydrated along with low potassium, low blood pressure, and renal failure.

I didn't realize that it could be the drug until I read some of the comments that are posted on this site.

Benicar has worked very well to lower my HBP and keep it at a safe level. I feel good on this drug and I don't swell in my hands and feet. My Dr recently changed my med to Losartan and I'm noticing alot of side effects. Reason for change is that I no longer have medical insurance so I really can't afford Benicar but Losartan is also very costly and I don't feel well with it. I would like to go back to benicar.,4,4,4
The top number of my blood pressure was running in the 200's.  With Benicar it is now 141 over 72.  I have gotten rid of the bad headaches that go with high blood pressure.  The only concern I have is the side effects for a mature woman past child bearing age.,5,5,5

"I had been taking this medication for 2 ½ years. 40/25 HCT. It lowered my pressure from 170/110 to 140/90 but never any lower (better within few hours after medication was taken and going up after few hours). On top of it I had constantly going off kidney stones (2-3 times a month), difficulties urinating (slow and painful), short breathing, periods of constipation. Had to stop talking. ",1,4,2
 I take Benicar HCT.  Had a bad cold (sinus & chest congestion). So I used nasal spray & took Musinex. I was transported to the ER < 2 hrs later after a bad seizure. Never had seizure or anything close before.  I also take Metformin (mild Type II).,5,4,5
I have been on this med for a couple weeks. I noticed redness and dryness around my nose. Its winter so i did not give it much thought. The next day i had a rash on my jaw and down my throat. One eye looked alittle swollen. By morning both eyes are severely swollen with the rash on face and throat. This is listed as a rare and severe side effect. I have never had a reaction from any med before. I have been on hp meds for 12 years.,4,1,4
"Extreme fatique, no energy at all. Don't want to get out of bed. Terrible muscle cramping, depression. Will ask physician to change medication.",4,1,4
"Tried so many other bp meds, been on 25 hct 12.5 for 8 years, however ringing in ears has become deafening,dry mouth at night,dry areas on face,without the hct it doesnt work as well controlling bp. It's the best so far, although expensive.",5,4,5
"After approx 1 yr developed abnormal lab readings, muscle cramps, loose bowels and heartburn. All symptoms started improving after 1 week off medicine.",4,1,3
I am been very satisfied with this medicine.,5,5,5
blood pressure went down 10 points,5,4,4
Great Medication. I have been on it for over 5 yrs with no side effects. BP runs about 114/78 all the time. Just received a letter from BCBS that it will no longer covered. I can't afford it w/o insurance paying for it so I will have to find an alternative.,5,5,5
"I've been taking Benicar Hct for about 5 years. During this time I haven't had any real issues with this drug, other than a constant need to urinate. I usually take it at night. I rather get up during the night to urinate than try to find a restroom all day long. In any event, I believe the drug worked well for me in the past.  It did lower my blood pressure nicely. However, recently I've been experiencing ringing in my ears. My doctors were unable to determine what is causing it. I'm not totally sure it's the Benicar. But I did note that other users have stated that they too have experienced ringing in the ears, since they've started this drug.  I do plan on stopping use for awhile to see if the ringing goes away. If it does, I will leave another comment regarding my experiences with Benicar.",4,4,5
"HAVE TRIED LISINOPRIL, CARTIA, TOPROL, WATER PILLS, ALL WITH SIDE EFFECTS.  WITH LISINOPRIL, I HAD A SIGNFICANT COUGH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE MY PHYSICIAN TOOK ME OFF IT. WITH TOPROL, I EXPERIENCED ASTHMA LIKE SYMPTOMS.  WITH BENICAR, I'VE HAD NO ADVERSE EFFECTS, AND IT WORKS GREAT TO KEEP MY BLOOD PRESSURE WNL",5,5,5
Tachycardia if you drink one beer.,4,2,3
"Since I just started taking this medication today at 5pm central standard time Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg.  My rating for its effectiveness and satisfaction is not accurate because I have not used it long enough to give a accurate rating.  Since it is only once a day, that makes its use an ease.  I can tell you that all through this month I have had blurry vision but it suddenly began to clear up a bit after just one hour after I took it.  So hopefully this is a good sign of even better things to come.  I will report on its use daily around this time for the next week.  Hopefully, I will stay side effect free but, I will report my personal experience with Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5 as the days go by.  See you all tomorrow.",5,3,3
"This has been very effective for control of BP when combined with Hytrin by my doctor. However thank you for the reviews I had been very concerned about the almost over powering fatigue. I was afraid I had developed narcolepsy, I fall asleep extemely easy ,even when driving . Thanks again !!",5,2,4
"During the first week, I had constant ""sweats"" but they subsided afterwards.  Now I feel back to my normal self.",5,5,5
"This medication is the best that I have taken. It works fine for me and I have been on it for three years now, with 120/60 or sometimes a little above or a little below.  It better then being very high like it used to be. I praise this medication, it sure works for me and I get little to no side effects. Not even enough to bother me to take notice.",5,5,5
overall seen to work no serious side effect,5,4,4
"Never had to take ANY meds before this. Doc said ""try it"" (March 2009). Lowered BP but with the cost fatigue,blurred vision,heavy eyelids,general overall aches.  EXPERIENCED EXCRUCIATING FULL LEG CRAMPING!!  Relatively certain this med contributed to, or caused lumbar spinal nerve and disc complications I experienced near paralysis to lower extremities for past 4 1/2 months including right foot drop, the side on which I experienced the most severe cramps. Stopped taking Benicar HCT 20/5 after 45 days. Doc said ""no way"" med had any link with my subsequent physical condition. Have slowly recovered with aid of physical therapy. Believe my body flushing this med out of my system as I am regaining functions.  ",3,1,3
"taking med for about 3 years, always tired,dizzy sometimes,coughing and sore throat take lonzeges.I have cut the pill in half and above symtoms have subsided a little.",2,2,4
It lowers my blood pressure but makes me very tired.,3,3,4
Controls blood pressure but have problems with potasium too low,5,3,5
"The only thing I am worried about this medication is that I am diabetic with an A1c of 6.5, and I am afraid that it may damage my Diabetes more. Other than that, I think is a very good medication.",5,4,3
"I have been taking this med for over four years and pleased with the results BUT--- THE SIDE EFFECTS MAKE ME WANT TO STAY IN BED AND NOT THINK ABOUY GETTING UP. VERY TIRED,HOT SWEATY AND NAUSEOUS. PLAN ON ASKING DR. TO SWITCH MEDS BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS.",5,1,5
"been on about one year ,butside effect of liver count rising and no other problems found.i have had cat scans,many blood tests i am stopping and then see.",4,3,4
"TAKE BENICAR HCT 40/12.5-HAD ""HIGH NORMAL"" BP FOR YEARS. SUDDENLY 3 YEARS AGO, BLOOD VESSEL BURST IN NOSE AND ER SAID BP WAS 250/190. HOSPITALIZED FOR A WEEK. DOCTOR TRIED MANY MEDS IN DIFF COMBOS; ON 3 AT ONE TIME. READ UP ON DIFF TYPES OF DRUGS-ACE INHIBS CAUSE COUGHING IN WOMEN (GOT MOM OFF 1-NO MORE COUGH). CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS AND BETA BLOCKERS CAUSED MORE SIDE EFFECTS (NUMBNESS, TINGLING, COLD FEELING HANDS/FEET). ANGIOTENSION RECEPTOR BLOCKER (ARB) BENICAR WORKED BEST-WANT TO DROP WATER PILL OFF COMBO. BP STAYS AROUND 120/70. ONLY SIDE EFFECT IS HIPS HURT (THEN LEGS) WHEN WALKING ANY DISTANCE. HOPE TO DROP ENOUGH WEIGHT TO GO OFF ALL BP MEDS.",5,4,5
"I'm on Benecar 40/12.5 for approximate 2 mos. I initially had dizziness when I was first put on the drug then went away by drinking plenty of liquids. I do experience some fatigue at times but, BP is under control. Averaging about 115/76. The highest was 160/101. I believe I also help lower it by changing my diet and increasing exercise. I current take the med every other day.",5,4,5
I am a 70 year old working male and I'm in good physical health other than hypertension.  I have been on this medication for several years and the one side effect has been a constant dry cough.  I take an antihistimine called Chlorpheniramine (4mg) to prevent the coughing.  I think Benicar also reduced my desire for sex.,5,4,5
This is my 8th medication to try and seems have finally hit it right. Various side effects with others so far not with this one. Dr. must seek approval from ins. co. Not on their list of preferred.,5,5,5
This med has maintained by b/p with little side effects.,5,5,5
"I was dx with HTN at age 16 and have maxed out several medications.  This medication has been effected and even reversed some of the damage that was happening to my kidneys.  I don't like the all of the trips to potty, but otherwise this has been a great treatment option for me.",5,5,5
I could not be more pleased with Benicar 40 HCT after two weeks of taking this BP medicine.  My doctor initially had me on a lower but separate dose of Benicar 20mg and Thiazide 12.5mg for three weeks with BP readings still averaging above 165/85.    My doctor then switched me to Benicar 40 HCT. After two weeks my readings are in the 120/70 range with minimal side effects- some slight lightheadedness after weight lifting and bike riding.  I wish everyone luck with Benicar HCT.,5,5,4
"No problems with med. I take at night, because it makes me sleepy, which is great,because I'm also an insomanic.",5,5,5
i realy don't know if it's helping,5,3,3
"Recently diagn w/ high BP has certainly lowered but now do not want to do anything. Very fatigued, no interest in anyting, some abdomin pain. Biggest prob is absolutely NO ENERGY!!",5,2,4
"I have tried two other meds and nothing worked.  This med has worked wonders for me. Matter of fact I have missed a couple of times taking the med and felt like my heart was trying to come out my chest.  Other than lots of pissing, lack of motivation at times and slight dizzy headaches, no worries.  Very satisfield.",5,5,5
I have a persistent cough.  Is this a side effect.,5,3,5
"Have swelling in face and legs,increased the ringing in ears,tired alot,starting ED recently,also leg cramps.",5,3,5
"Low Blood pressure, fatigue, fast heart beat, muscle cramps",4,2,4
"Dizzy,lightheaded,leg aches,blurred vision,lack of concentration,memory loss,confusion,lack of motivation,some depression,dull headaches.",5,1,5
"4 days into the drug I experienced, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, loss of balance, fatigue, headache, neck and upper back pain. I will not take this again until I check with my doctor. I don't know if this drug is the cause but I also experienced leg pain when walking that I never experienced before. It did work though, my systolic dropped from the upper 140's into the mid 80's!",4,2,4
I have tried several Blood Pressure medications and this is the only one that has worked for me.,5,5,5
"i have been taking benicar for one week and i have expericed non stop dizzyness,tired, feeling faint and rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath after excercise. I did not experience this after working out in the past. I also have numbness in my arm. i will see what happens for another week, after that i will ask my dr for another medicine to treat my hypertention",5,2,2
"I am experiancing significan dryness on the sides of my face.  Also experianced a painful sore inside my nostrils and inner ear.  Anyone else experiancing this.  Otherwise, the drug is working well for me.",5,4,4
"Immediately after starting Benicar, I had Dizzy spells while getting up from a chair.  A month afer starting on Benicar, I started feeling nauseous and tired with some blurred vision.  After my two month checkup, my Creatinine levels were at dangerous levels.  I was going into Kidney failure!  This is a strong drug.  Be cautious using it and sensitinve to the side effects.  ",2,1,1
This medication caused extreme dizziness/lightheadedness.,3,1,3
leg pain,4,4,4
"I have been using benicar hct 40/12.5 for about 3 months with very good results.  My bp went from 150/110 down to 110/80. At this time, I haven't had any adverse side effects and it seems to be working.",5,4,4
feeling sick to my stomach since taking Benicar,3,3,4
"Started on an ACE about 3-1/2 years ago.  Started having a cough, and my BP was not controlled.  Was switched to Benicar, and the cough was gone in a little over a week.  I read the posts on this drug, and had to respond.  This drug did what it was suppose to do, lower my blood pressure.  I have not had any side effects and I have been on it for over three years, no kidney issues, fatigue, etc.  In fact this is the best that I have felt in years!  I was a little dizzy at times for the first few days, but my DR told me that is was just the medicine lowering my BP.  He said that it took many years to raise my BP to 180/120, and I was lowering it in a few days.  That would cause the dizziness.  Sure enough in a few days it was gone.  My BP has remained at 117/ 75 for three years.  I can’t ask for anything better.  Yes it is more expensive than a generic.  I pay $20 a month.  Ask your DR for samples, they will give them to you each visit.  For me the $10 increase in cost, over the generic, far outweighs the side effects.  As far as the people that have crazy side effects, and stop taking the medicine, and within a day or a few hours they are gone, I don’t think it was the medicine.  These drugs take weeks to get into you system, and weeks to get out.  Even after you stop taking them.  Maybe it was all in your head, or was it something your friends at the local Bingo parlor told you that they experienced, and now you have it to.  The mind is a powerful drug in its own right!  Give the medicine and chance, and let it do what it is suppose to do.  I read that one lady said that her husband lost his libido on this drug.  Viagra, and the other ED drugs are failed BP drugs.  This drug should help his little soldier stand at attention as she said.  If you do research on this drug, you will find that it fights the hormone that constricts the veins.  If more blood is flowing to parts of the body, then…  Think about it!  Good luck with this drug, you will not be disappointed! A++",5,5,5
It seem to be working for me.,4,5,4
"My doctor has me on this drug and decided a few months ago that I should double my pills...I did and was to go in for an angy and stents in my legs...they had to cancel because of a bacterial infection..meanwhile my blood test showed my kidney function was messed up, my potassium was high and my magnesium was low.they now are going to do the surgery tomorrow..but again my kidney function is good, my magnesium is low and my potassium is high..the nurse said to stop this drug because it contains potassium in it or something that will make the potassium go up..and my kidneys are acting up again...I had stopped it after I got out of the hospital the first time for a week and my kidney function came back normal...I feel this medicine is the culprit..doctors don't always tell you everything involved with the drugs you take, or they aren't up on the awareness..I will find out when I go back for blood test after the surgery...",5,2,3
"worked great but new prob.has come up... My husband had moderate-high HBP 200/110 once and other times about 180/99 mostly 150/90,but he was so irratable,quick to anger, depressed,tired always it was bad, so doc gave the 20/12.5 the first couple of days some dizziness when getting up, no major complaints mild nausea 1st few days. he takes it at night so no effects,no major aches but he works hard so he probably passed it off on work. It was a god send he felt great re-energised,he said his mouth dry a lil, but no big complaints. he has been on it over a year and recently he has lost libido. I only seen 1 other comm. on this.its not full on E.D. but interest has declined alot and sometimes his soldier wont stand at FULL attention any ideas from you other guys? only 1 other have this? but he has been very pleased with med. untill recently anyway. he says it still works great for him. any comments welcome.",5,4,5
I have water retention in my feet since I have taken this. I have never had high blood pressure. ,4,2,2
It has helped to maintain my bloodpressure,4,4,4
My blood presure went down and I felt very relaxed,5,5,4
"I was taking 240 mg diltiazem daily which caused chronic comstipation. I was changed to Benicar Hct and was immediately relieved, no adverse symptons so far 3 weeks now.",5,5,5
My BP has dropped to a normal level while using this med. I also have dizzy spells. Severe lower leg/foot cramps. After reading the posts here I will ask my Dr to find me something else.,3,3,3
"Started taking this bp medicine in Dec. 2007 along with toporol xl.Because I had bronchitis in January 2008 I took mucinex dm which sent me to the hospital with stroke like symptoms. Er doctor said I needed to speak to Dr. about bp med.  Also had many problems on benicar hct.  Rapid heartbeat, feet cramping , severe diarrhea, feeling like everything inside of me was going awry,and just not feeling well at all.  Saw my Dr. and a heart Dr. but couldn't find anything wrong with me. I was sure the diuretic in the benicar was dehydrating me and pulling everthing out of me. My insurance made me switch to Diovan HCT and I still had the same problems.  I suspected the diuretic in the bp med but was told it was not. For 10 months I was sick with these symptoms.  In October I told the Dr. I wanted off the diuretics.  ALL SYMPTOMS WENT AWAY. Am on diovan 80 now and doing GREAT.  Please watch the diuretics!!!!! They could be your problem.",2,1,2
What concerns me is that the doctor prescribed   this medication to someone with diabetes.He had a seizure this evening and I believe it has to do with this drug.I will be calling the Dr. in the morning.,4,3,3
this med. worked well controlling my high blood presure but it caused a side effect not listed hear. It caused me to have hemeroids and lots of rectal bleeding.,5,1,3
"Height of blood pressure 210/169 Been taking for about a year and my blood pressure has been good, strangly though it bounces from normal to low. My joints do hurt but didn't think it was from this drug. Worst part is not able to do much because everytime I start doing something streanous my heart races. I have tried several different meds and with all heart medicine the first month of taking is always the worst. I don't have insurance so I get sample packs from my Dr. I do beleive however that it is the reason I have depression problems. I am a young person so fealing the effects of being old is very diffucult for me to handle. ",5,3,5
"Used it for 5 years, worked well, except recent blood tests showed high kidney functions/filtration.  went off of it and kidney functions back to normal.  Now on Norvasc",4,3,4
no other medication seemed to be as effective.  however it is way too expensive so i have had to beg meds from my doctors.,5,5,5

Extreme fatigue and occasional dizziness. Also reduced kidney filtration rate to below normal in last blood test. Am now off this drug,4,2,3
"Been on this for years.  Have never had ANY side effects.  BP immediately dropped.  Unfortunately, my insurance has dropped it from its preferred list, but it has worked so well I am paying the higher price rather than risk the side effects of another medication.",5,5,5

Don't like feeling this way.",3,2,2
"I was on Hyzaar.  My insurance co. decided it would not be a preferred drug.  I tried benicor HCT.  I was OK for 3 weeks.  Suddenly I became very fatigued and felt drugged.  I had terrible knee pain.  All I wanted to do was sit or sleep.  My eyesight seemed to be quite blurry.  I couldn't concentrate.  I went off the med this morning and went back to Hyzaar.  After just one day off the benicor, I feel 1000% better, my knee pain is gone, my eyesight is better, my energy is back.  I don't care if the drug lowers my pressure, the side effects aren't worth it... especially for a lousy insurance company.  I'm back to Hyzaar and back to being normal.",3,1,3

"Uncontrolled HBP (avg. 200/115) for years, tried everything, cut salt out, lost weight, exercised,  Ramipril, Coreg, Clonidine, Diovan, overlapped multiple meds, nothing worked.  Went for MRI to rule out blockage or blood to kidneys or adrenal gland problems…nothing.  I was taking Lipitor anyway, so doctor said let’s try Caduet , honestly, 1 day, and BP was down to avg. 123/77, I had to stop taking some of the other meds because it was getting too low!  This is a miracle drug for me.  Everybody is different, and the causes are different, just so glad we finally found the one that works for me.",5,5,5
I have not had any negative effects from this medication. I like it much better than taking 2 different meds for High BP & High Cholesterol.,5,5,5
"I'm taking this for high BP & high Cholesterol. I previuosly took Zestril & Lopid to control each problem. I was concerned about liver damage from Lopid and asked to try a combination product.

I'm glad there are other doctors who take their patients seriously! for all of you: listen to your body and don't be shoved aside by a doctor who thinks he""s God Almighty!",4,1,3

I felt very old, fatigued and depressed. I lost a great job. This medication is expensive so I quit taking it. It's been 5 days without this medicine and I am starting to feel so much better.

"I was prescribed this medicine 20 years ago and used the name brand Capoten . I also take Thyroid replacement meds . Thyroid Gland regulates blood pressure. In the past the pharmacy has filled with generic form Captopril by mistake so I tried it and 1st I noticed the side effects (red face and red eyes were missing, when I took it) at first I liked that, but after few days noticed my pressure was high ! Found out it was not working, so went back and got Capoten ,problem solved . Well solved until Capoten became unavailable few years ago. I had to have the dose doubled 25 mg to make the Captopril effective but did not do as good as Capoten despite what the pharmacist tells you . Have had some high pressure readings of 160/105 so dosage prescribed went up 50 mg , now 100mg a day . Most times pressure stays the same after taking it , and at the most it will bring it down 10 points . Possible that i've become resistant to it or need additional meds . Captopril is the active ingredient in Capoten but my personal experience is why I don't like Captopril . I like the low cost but would gladly pay the 60 bucks for the name brand based on what i've seen . Everybody is differant but wanted to share my experience .           ",2,1,2

The feeling is a very uncomfortable one. I also have face numbness on my left second whenever I take this medicine. IÃ¢Â?Â?m sure it works for others, but for me, the side effects are enough to say no. ",5,2,5

I switched back to the other medication but am going to start on Atenelol which doesn't have as many adverse side effects as Metoprlol.This was one of the worst medications I have ever taken. Heed the reviews! ",1,1,1

"I have been on this drug for 10 days.  It immediately lowered my blood pressure.  I have had zero side effects.   I’m prescribed just 12.5 milligrams and am thinking 25 would keep my blood pressure at a little more acceptable numbers, but the doc makes that decision ",5,4,4
So nauseous all day. Hate this feeling. Quit it yesterday. Didn't have a problem with the direretic that I am aware of. I am just sick all day.  Yes you lose weight you don't feel like eating.  Some diahrrea too. ,1,1,1

For first 2 weeks, was really dehydrated, had night foot and leg cramps, light-headedness, generalized weakness, strong-smelling urine, constipation, and dehydration that was pretty severe. Would have passed out while shopping, but found a chair just in time. BP dropped to 100/50. Now I take 12.5 mg chlorthalidone and 100 mg Losartin or 25 mg chlorthalidone and 50 mg Losartin (Dr. said doesn't matter which) and feel much better. BP same. BTW, water is NOT ENOUGH to rehydrate. You need electrolyte replacement. I found recipe for homemade Gatorade online and drink two glasses every day (secret ingredient = coconut water). This medication really works, unlike hydrocholorothyazide, and that's why I stuck with it through the tough part. Good luck - I hope it works for you, too. And don't underestimate weight loss as a solution - it's the best medicine of all and it's free!",5,5,5

"I started out a month ago with 50mg of Chorthaladone and after a week of taking it, I was having headaches and constipation. I am now taking 25mg by cutting in half and see the same BP readings that I was getting with the higher dosage. I do have to make sure that I am eating more fruits and vegetables and lately making smoothies with Kale. This keeps the constipation under control. I am losing the weight that I couldn't do before when taking other BP meds. I also noticed that the large veins in my hands are not swollen like before and I have more energy and less confusion and clarity in my thought pattern. I also believe that the higher dosage was causing heavy pressure on the bladder. I was one that was given so many other meds that all gave me side effects that weren't worth the cure and I believe caused me many of the problems that I have had. I finally went to the Cardiologists and he is the one who prescribed this one. The drug Diltiazem given by my PCP after telling him 180mg was given me palpatations, increased the dose to 300mg which after two days the palpataions were so bad that I stopped the meds and I made my own appointment with the cardiologist. One thing that I've found out, you must take responsibility for your own health which includes questioning any meds that you take and stopping them immediately if you don't feel right and if your doctor does not find a good option for you, change doctors.",5,4,4

"I took this med for about six years, then a new doctor changed it and I had to take something to relieve the asthmatic attacks the new one caused.  Eventually I was taking more of each and finally threw them all out for a few years.  Kept my BP under control with diet for a few years, then it started to rise again.  Docs tried me on two differnt beta blockers, which didn't work, so I begged my doctor to put me back on Chlorthalidone.  he did, and my BP has been normal for about a year.

And this was like that for 5 or 6 hours. Really strange feeling. I will give it time to work as it was only my first one. I'll just have to wait and see if it keep doing that.

"I am taking 100-25 mg. I've been on this dosage for approximately a year and although it has indeed lowered my BP, I have no energy what-so-ever to do even the smallest task. It's very annoying when you have a busy schedule and a ton of things to do in a day. Some days I cannot even get up off the couch...",4,2,5
"I have been on A/C for a over 8 months and it has helped my numbers tremdously. However, the believe I am experiecing some side effects. First, I am very active in tennis and biking. I am noticing my level of energy has decreased, I had a bout with gout, my ankles get swollen and big toe joint pain. Not to mention ED as well. Is it the drug, if so, I need to ween off. I am on a weight loss mission. If I can lose 45lbs, I believe that will do it.",4,2,4
"I've been on this medicine, Altenolol-Chlorthalidone 50-25, for one month. I am also taking 100 mg of Losartan, to lower my blood pressure. Readings went from 190/100, to 98/65, which my cardiologist states is an excellent reading. When i mentioned the way i felt, he lowered my Losartan, to 50mg, to help my body adjust to the change in bp. However, I still have side effects of; feeling totally drained, dizzy..blurred vision,at times, as well as nausea,on and off. I'm happy with my new bp readings, and all of the tests I have had,are normal. Yet this seems to be making me feel worse, than I did with high blood pressure.",4,3,4

"What's the point of treating high blood pressure when the mediation increases hunger and leaves one so exhausted that exercise is impossible? Isn't that counter productive? It also takes away any motivation to do the things that I enjoy. This should be used in place of Thorazine! I would rather have a beautiful, happy life and risk the effects of hypertention than spend the rest of my days on the couch. I don't know which is unhealthier!",5,1,5
"My first BP med caused a chronic cough after 1 month, so I switched to this.  It worked great on BP but after 2 months I had several frustrating side affects.  Dry mouth, weight gain, EXTREME dizzyness when getting up.  Sore/stiff lower back when standing up.  Stopped taking.",4,1,4

"I have been taking this medicine for 11 years and it has controlled by blood pressure. No problems in that area.... However when you take a look at the side effects, I have developed several, that I wasn't aware were caused by the medicine.  High levels or Uric Acid, which caused Gout.... for 2 years I have suffered with that.. High blood sugar and have been put on medicine for that. High cholestoral as well as.  Could not figure out was going on with me, until the endocrinologist talked to me and I expressed how dissatisfied I was with my regular doctor.  I started seeing a new doctor that told me that my medicine predisposed me for gout and other things.... I did not have any sign of these other things before I started taking this medicine.  It's been a week since I have been taken off of the chlorthalidone (diuretic) part of the medicine and swelling has gone down in my foot and less pain... Make sure you read the side effects to your medicine.  By the way, these side effects were not listed on the page from the pharmacy... (Also warning.. Who should not take this medicine...) Because my gout, diabetes and high uric acid are on that list as well.. My old doctor never changed my medicine...",5,4,5

This medication makes me sweat profusely! My BP is sometimes good and at other times not so good. BP is very inconsistent with this medication.

Now my doc recommends that I take only half a pill because it is doing a good job.  Side affects - I get tired easily when walking - which I hate, and trouble losing weight.

I was put on this for suspected angina but then told fibromyalgia was causing heart spasms. I'm stopping it as the Australian summer coming in makes me swell up so this on top of that would be unbearable.

Initially switch to an ACE inhibitor and the blood pressure was fine but the resting heart rate was too high, however, erectile dysfunction ceased and all worked normally again.

"Medication keeps my heart rate low and my BP low but the side effects still linger. Muscles, joints aches and cramps. Have a little pressure headache on the left side of temple. Not severe ache but you can tell its there. Like a dull ache in the head. Happens at least once or twice a day since on the medication for almost 2 months. I was off of it for a few days to try another medication and I didn't have the aches and cramps but had an allergic reaction to the other medication (NIFEDIPINE). Went back on Diltiazem because they changed the dose to 1 cap a day instead of 1 cap twice a day and they up my dose to 240mg since im taking it once a day. I was taking 180mg twice a day 24 HR extended release so the doctor was guessing that my side effects were severe because I was taking too much of it and changing it may reduce a little. My face use to flush and tingle as well when taking it twice a day but that hasn't happened since I am taking it once a day just dealing with other side effects.

Went to the endocrinologist thinking it could be my thyroid, since I'm hypo, but all thyroid test came back ok. Also this doctors and other doctors, have told me the alopecia is due to stress.  I quit my Job thinking it was afecting me, even went to a psychologist, went to a dermatologist (injected me for 7 months) and I still have the alopecia  (big bald spot on the back of my scalp and on the sides), no job, no stress, whatsoever, I live a peaceful life, and I'm still at point A.  My belief? The diltiazem, I'm allergic to this damn pill or I be a low percent of the population taking this med that gets hair loss and alopecia. Has anyone Liver the same experience. For doctors It's very easy not to investigate and say It's just stress.   ",5,1,5

I panic when this happens as the rapid hb can go for 30 minutes to 24 hrs.  Not knowing the duration is the issue.  I use it with Metropol but not a 100% fix.

i was prescribed this after my angioplasty,4,4,4
It produced only a moderate decline in my systolic BP (around 5 mm Hg) and no change in my diastolic BP. It induced a rapid weight gain (2.0 lb/month) even with a reduced caloric intake. It also caused persistent itching in my forearms. ,5,1,2

"Works great for keeping down my blood pressure.  I am having a couple of side effects that arent listed.  One is incontinence.  With any straining I have urine leakage.  It is horribly embarrasing.  I am also experiencing deterioration of eyesight.  The good news is that with some of the other HBP meds I had worse side effects like hair loss, fatigue and weight gain.  I dont have that with this med.  I wonder if there is some phamacologist some where that could explain this to all of us..? ",5,3,5

"I've was on for 3 days while in hospital. Gives abdominal pain, migraines, nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness. Off med for few days until pcp puts me back on it even after complaints about side effects. Very wicked med. Controlled & slowed down racing heart, But, side effects were as bad if not worse.

Greatly improved side effects of beta blocker.  Not as effective in reducing tachy. yet tolorable.  Arrythmias okey.  So will stick with CA channel blocker.",5,3,3
I may have not been on the drug long enough yet for full effects.  ,4,2,1
"Diltiazem was prescribed to control BP & heart rate after bypass surgery.  Side effects from taking diltiazem (30 mg 3 daily) for 5 weeks are: persistent pounding ""sinus type"" headache particularly below eyes with jaw/tooth pain, sore/swollen throat (difficult to swallow), singing/popping ears, swollen lymph glands, and an increase in liver enzymes.  I wake up with few side effects but within an hour after morning dose the side effects kick in.  Diltiazem was ineffective in controlling my BP.  My cardiologist seemed surprised by the side effects but agreed to change medication to verapamil - the side effects are now worse than diltiazem.  I suspect I am either alergic or hypersensitive to the calcium channel blockers.  Be careful if you have similar symptoms - this can be mean stuff.  ",4,1,2
"Five years ago I used it for control of afib and it worked great, just made me a little sluggish.  My afib lessened and I stopped using it for five years.  Afib started up again and I started using it again.  It made me very sleepy in the afternoons, I had difficulty sleeping at night, I was having terrible dreams and after 6 weeks I found that it had made me feel somewhat depressed, I felt very flat didn't care about anything.  My sex life diminished and I experienced erectile dsyfunction the last 3 weeks (I was on it 7 weeks). I stopped taking it, two day later erectile dsyfunction was gone, my libido came back, and I felt great.  I was surprised, it was so easy to take the first time and it really helped control the afib.",2,4,4
"The biggest problem with this med is that it's hard to swallow. It floats. A low does of this med lowered my bloodpressure, helped my a-fib, eliminated my migraines, and got rid of my anxiety/anger problems. ",3,5,5
"I have been on this specific diltiazem for 2 years. once a day is great. I take it at 8 p.m., then I lay down because I get tired and dizzy but I am okay during the day. I had a hopsitalization but that was because of caffeine, no more of that. I think it might be giving me a rash on the chest, making my hair fall out (but nothing crazy) and I'm not sure if it may be doing something to my sex drive.",5,4,4
"swollen feet and ankles, weight gain, headaches, can't get shoes on even after taking lasik for the fluid retention",3,2,3
"This mediine almost killed me.  I was on too much for too long. (420) mg capsule  I stayed in the emergency room with heart racing and pulse too low to register.  Also my BP was high but pulse low.  I started losing my hair badly like chemo, according  to my hairdresser.  I had numerous stomach and digestive problems as well.  I felt terrible all the time and never slept.  I finally called the doctor and demanded to be changed to another medication.  I should have realized it was causing these problems, but was on other meds including some for arthritis so it took almost dying to know something was bad wrong.  It was way too much dosage.  My BP was not that high.  Horrible medicine!!!",1,1,1
"At the beginning of my high blood medication treatment I was given Diltiazem and it made me sick, bloated and barely able to walk up a flight of stairs.  Told my doctor and he then prescribed Cartia instead.  Cartia was doing pretty good.  No bloating, no swelling no nothing.  Went to get a refill one month to discover they changed my pill to another manufacturer.  This one is a blue and white capsule which is 240mg.  This is right back to where I first began with swelling, water retention and not lowering my blood pressure.  Finally went to the Doctor who gave me Lasix to help me rid my body of extra fluid.  Meanwhile, I already take 25mg of HCTZ per day along with Cozaar.  Stopped taking Diltaliazem and blood pressure is lower with less water retention.  This medication causes water retention which sometimes won't lower the blood pressure.  Not good for me.  Cartia Manufacturer says that the brand name is not available right now.  Not taking Dilt anymore.",5,1,2

"I've been taking this drug for about 6 months to help with an irregular heartbeat issue.  It has definitly helped...not totally, but I would say about 85% of the problem has been corrected.  I'm taking the 120MG capsules.  I haven't noticed any significant side effects.  I was worried that I would be tired all the time but that hasn't really been the case.  This is a smaller dosage than a lot of others so maybe that is the reason.",5,4,4
I've been on 360mg a day for three years now - I've put on weight and am tired even after a full night's sleep. Good to know I'm not the only one with the same side affects  ,5,3,5

My doctor recently took me off this medication.  While taking this medication my blood sugar levels were out of control.  Levels at 300 - 400+  I had to take more and more insulin without levels going down.

"Works very well to control blood pressure, however, for me, it also lowers my pulse greatly.  I wore a 24 hour heart monitor which showed my pulse as low as 41 bpm while sleeping.  Daytime pulse rarely over 80 bpm unless exercising.  Occasional lightheadedness.  But overall works better at controlling blood pressure than other drugs I've tried .",5,4,5

"Thanks to all for the reviews.  They are an eye-opener and confirm my suspicions about Diovan.  After many years at 160-25 my new doctor upped the dosage to 320-25 about two months ago.  I now realize this drug has caused the terrible fatigue, muscle weakness, and throat swelling that I have recently experienced.  I am beginning to wonder, too, if some of the problems I had for years while on the lower dose could be attributed to this drug.  These included low level fatigue, low energy, and ED.  I stopped taking this drug today and will be starting Esselstyn's diet, as it purports to help with hypertension and related issues.  It was recommended to me years ago.  I wish I had heeded good advice then.",3,1,3

I take Valsartan HCT 160/25 for high BP. My major concern with it is urination---sometimes I get up 5 times a night. My blood pressure stays in the range of 135-160 on the upper end and between 67-80 on the lower end at a given time of the day. My uncle was a Physician---he would say as long as you BP is in the range of 100 + your age on the high side---it is okay.,5,4,5
"My spouse took Valsartan medicine with diovan and developed a chronic cough that is unbearable. The allergy doctor caught it and he is now off it.

Besides all that his sciatic pains came back from the chronic cough.",3,1,2

I was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) when I had my physical last year, but my nurse practitioner denied that it could be caused by the Diovan.  I am going to discontinue it and hope that I can lower my BP with diet and exercise.  I also hope that my hair and platelet count improve.  ",5,3,4

"Caused a very long period of disabling fatigue and mental confusion from the HCTZ. Doctors did not associate the side effects. I had Lupus for which this drug is contraindicated. Lupus had not been diagnosed, but I still feel the doctors should have figured this out. ",5,1,3
"When I first developed high blood pressure, I was put on Diovan 80 mg and then shortly after that 160 mg. I had great control of my blood pressure for years.  Then after about 4 years my blood pressure started increasing again. So my physician started me on Diovan/Hydrochlorothiazide 160/25--this worked  for me without any obvious side effects.  After a few years my kidney function decreased very slightly which is a known side effect, so my physician decreased the hydrochlorothiazide to 12.5 mg.  In general I like this medication very much.  It controls my blood pressure, and I don't have any obvious side effects.  The kidney effects are known and the prescribing information says that small decreases in kidney function are not reasons to stop the medication.  I'm sure it happens with most people on a chronic diuretic.",4,5,4
"I have been on Diovan HCT for over 10 years. I started on 160mgHCT but it was increased to 320HCT. I did have trouble with my have breaking, it doesn't seen to be breaking anymore.It seen as though every since this medicine was increased I have had trouble sleeping.",5,3,4

"I have been taking Diovan for many years now. It has really helped, along with diet, getting my blood pressure to an acceptable level. The doctor is pleased with the results. As for side effects: I do experience dizziness sometimes when I stand up quickly. So, I have learned to rise slowly and that (usually) keeps the dizziness at bay. It does cause me to have more bowel movements than I had before, and that is annoying but nothing that alters my life. Finally, I have noticed it does not mix well with alcohol at all, at least for me. And I am not talking binge drinking or excessive drinking. Even one or two drinks usually gives me a headache, and I did not have that prior to going on Diovan. It would be nice to enjoy a glass of wine or a beer a few times a week, but I am happy with my blood pressure readings so the sacrifice is worth it to me. ",5,4,5

I am also on  Synthroid for lack of a thyroid.    Curious, I tried an experiment:  what is my blood pressure WITHOUT Diovan?  Guess what...no difference.

At first I had not noticed what are now clearly the side effects of the medications.. light headedness, dizzy, joint pain, achy feeling, steady weight gain, new ichy rash as attributes of the meds.. other than I was feeling fine (if that can classifed as fine) BP was fluxuating between 140/110-90 to 110/70.. I have started exercising regularing, controling my diet and trying to lose some weight. My weight has not gone down, but seems to be going up despite all my best efforts. My husband recently experienced similiar reactions to other medications that he was taking - again, later discovered that the meds were causing the problem. I thought maybe this is my problem. I stumbbled across many of the same feelings and side effects.. I will be making an immediate appointment with the Dr. and getting off this stuff.. I often wonder why the drug manufacturers think that we will simply miss the ill effects in hopes for a greater benefit.  I never thought this would be me.. I am hoping to get a sense of normal back.",3,1,3

"I have been taking this drug for 5 years and it works relatively well as far as regulating BP. However, my insurance co. will no longer cover the cost of the prescription, which CVS wants to charge $144 per month for. In an attempt to find out if there is a generic or replacement drug, i stumbled across some user reviews. The side effects reported by other users have truly shed light on the problems that may have been exacerbated by this drug. #1 Severe muscle cramping! When I asked my DR 4 yrs ago if it could be this, he simply gaffed it off as me being a big fat pig who complains about aching muscles. #2 Severe sinus congestion that has been ruled out as any typical allergy by the ENT who thinks I am NUTS because I can get no relief. #3 Severe stomach pains and frequent bathroom visits, especially at the on-set. After 4 days of no MEDS - because the DR is stalling and won't write a replacement prescription, I have no cramps, I can breathe, and I am not popping pepto or gaviscon every few hours. Apart from the fact that my hands and feet are swollen and I have a headache, I feel pretty good. There are so many problems with this situation: #1 My doctor is obviously not too bothered by the fact that I may have a stroke - I should find somebody new. #2 This pill should not cost $4 a day - it's not made of gold and isn't experimental ar magic. #3 My insurance company blows. #4 The FDA needs to do more for patients. Why does it take a google search to help me find that many of my complaints and aches and pains could have been remedied 5 years ago? Yes, I am fat, but despite what my (also fat) doctor thinks, fat is not the root of my problems. A crappy physician is who doesn't care about me is.",2,1,4

"BP on the rise after initially on Atenolol 25 mg, was put on Diovan also rather than increase the Atenolol dosage.

It has worked some, but not as well as needed (still get borderline numbers even with the meds). Besides not working well, the downside: extreme weight gain, fatigue.

"Been on HCT for several years (3+ yrs)1st mth had headaches but went away. Did notice weight gain in the mid-section, hair loss and cough but did not contibute to drug until reading these comments. However, within the last yr I've experienced severe muscle cramps & joint pain (so severe I felt like my shins were breaking in half) and I wear out really quickly and frequent urination. Come to find out drug lowered my potassium levels so now I'm taking a potassium supplement along with the HCT which seems to help a little with the cramping but not take them completely away. Just walking around the grocery store still wears me out.  Also, have been experiencing lower back pain and not being able to sleep at night and extremely tired during the day probably due to lack of sleep at night. Anxiety attacks(feels like I'm on speed) and can be very moody.  Went to DR yesterday & explained problems and she says that my dosage maybe to high therefore lowered my dosage. Right now I'm taking 2 - 160/25 a day so I'm going to try lowering to 2 - 160-12.5 a day. Hopefully that will help with the side effects and if not, I'm defintely trying something else. This weight gain in the mid section is killing me. :) All in all the drug is very good at lowering the BP and if you can deal with the side effects or don't have any at all it's a good BP med to be on. I've tried several different kinds and this is the only one that has actually worked at lowering my BP. Now I'm happy to say my BP runs around 126/80 which is a great for me.

My hair is half as thick as it was a year ago. Started so slowly I didn't really notice. My Dr said it wasn't the drug. I researched and found that it is a side effect.

I have been on this medication for about 2 + yrs. now and the pain in my joints, muscles and back have been getting extremely worse.  I can't get out of bed without limping, I am in severe pain when I walk and most of the time I want to sleep.  Before I started taking this medicine I was very active.  Even my hair is beginning to fall out more and my headaches have gotten worse.  I have had so many tests done to find the root of my problems and everything was negative.  I believe it is all a result of taking Diovan HCT.  I am going to have the doctor change it to see if the pain goes away.",4,3,4
worked immediately.three months later I'm having dizzy spells could it be diovan?,5,5,5
"Been on Diovan HCT for 2 years, increasing dosage to 320/12.5 mg. with no side effects until the past 8 months.  Side effects have since included pain in hips, legs and numbness of calves/feet when walking more than 2-3 blocks.  Mentioned to doctor that I had seen same side affects posted on web and suggested taking me off of Diovan HCT. He didn't think the medication could be the cause. I've been off of it for 1 week and hip pain gone after 24 hours.  Pain/numbness of calves and feet have improved although calves still feel tighter than normal.  Feet no longer go numb when walking.",4,2,4
"I was taking Diovan 160 BP was at 120/90.  Doctor switched me to 320/12.5 and blood pressure now regularly at 130/80.  Not sure why the increase in the systolic number, but the doctor hasn't been concerned.  Other than that the medicine has worked better than the 160 with few if any side effects.  Actually with working out and eating properly I have experienced weight loss.",4,4,4
my rx calls for 160mg/12.5 2x per day. My bp varies from 120/72 to 160/90 so it is not consistently effective. The muscle cramps in my buttocks and lower back are a concern plus a muscle contraction in one eye causes major vision problems.,5,3,3
Had a hard time getting use to it.  Seems OK now.  Been on it for 4 years.  Have problems with E.D. and occasional troubles having BM's.,3,3,3
I am Pauline Bishop and Diavan hct has helpet me.I all so have have other problems with my health.Pjb,5,5,5
"I'm not sure what to say about how this drug reacts with me.  I use it with atenenol , which I take twice daily and with just taking the atenenol alone Ihave some headaches and heaviness in my chest and with the diovan it's not as bad.  Is it something I can do without?  By itself Diovan does much of nothing.  I really don""t think I want to rate this product but find a connection to somewhere that can tell me the reactions between multible drugs",4,3,3

"New to Diovan HCT since coughing spells w/Lisinopril. Started on 80mg/12.5mg, but needed to up it to 160/25 due to returning edema. Bloodwork is showing elevated liver enzymes now. Will be seeing MD for this next week. Could be side effect. I also have gained weight around my mid-section. Is this common and how long does it last? I can't afford to gain any extra weight. I'm also hypothyroid & have maintained my weight (albeit not what I would like) for the last 15 years. Recently had a hysterectomy to remove a mass also. I really don't need any more problems.",4,4,5
"MOST OF THE TIME I DON'T HAVE HEADACHES ANYMORE BUT, IF I DRINK CAFFEINE IN MAJOR QUANTITIES, MY PRESSURE GOES SKY HIGH AND IT TAKES A LONGER THAN NORMAL TIME TO COME BACK DOWN.

MY HBP IS STILL HIGH BUT NOT AS BAD AS WHEN I TOOK NORVASC AND LOPRESSOR. I'LL GIVE THIS DIOVAN A FEW MORE WEEKS BEFORE I TRY SOMETHING ELSE OR NOT..THANKS",4,3,3

It completely eliminated my coughing spells which I experienced with Lotensin.,5,5,5
"Side effects are annoying on a daily basis. Such as pressure sensation in gums, fatigue, what seems to be lower colon agitaion and pulse sensation in neck and or chest.

"Originally, I was on Diovan/HCT 160/12.5.which lowered mu pressure SOME down to 140/76 and I had NO side effects! It was very easy to take and I Taught High School, daily,  with NO problems.  But, my doctor INSISTED that I lower the pressure MORE and gave me 320/12.5 which I am on now...This dosage is UN-bearable. I have rapid, then slow breathing, dizziness, light headed, stomach weight gain, larger arms...But my doctor would not reduce the meds.  I wrote him a letter explaining all of this then called him, explaining, that I was in and out of the ER because of the increased pill. I wanted and asked the doctor to Please return me to the lower dosage that I felt worked well for ME...This doctor refused and refused to refill any more pills.  When I called his office he told me to find another doctor. I am forced to break the pills half until I can find another doctor.

I SUFFER FROM ANXIETY FROM THIS MEDICATION THAT THE ONLY THING THAT BOTHERS ME ,5,2,5

Then, on day 14, in the early a.m. hours, I had severe, severe shoulder and elbow joint pain in my left arm. Pain level was a 10.

Also started the generic when it became available. I take it at bedtime and have not had any of the side effects mentioned in the articles on WEB MD. I'm still living here in 2016, so I'm supposing along with my MD that it's doinig a good job.

In the morning ( fasting) my blood pressure was high, and 2 hours after taking this medication there is no improvement. My doctor resolved my health problem when he switched me to another generic.

In the hospital for 2 days. Don't know what caused it, but was taken off the Diovan and put on Norvasc.  Other than that my blood pressure was low.

"I take 160 mg twice a day. It took a few months to get the dosage right, but it works well, at this dosage. I also take HYDROCHLOROT 12.5mg once a day. since I matabalize medication quicker than the 12 hour time release is suppose to last, I need the Hydrochlorot mid day to avoid any high spikes from occurring before time for my next dosage. The medication seams to take a while to get blood pressure levels stabilized in my system and I have to make sure I do not miss a dosage. Before my Doctor found the right dosage and combination, my pressure would suddenly spike into the 200 and 300 range! ",5,5,4

"Have taken this for years with no problems. It was recommended to me by a pharmacist friend after encountering issues with other blood pressure medications. Was recently switched to Valsartan (generic)and began to experience random dizzy spells. Am concerned that the timed release isn't working and noticed after research the generic manufacturer has had problems in their plant located in India.  Am going back to Diovan, it is a bit pricier but can't have random dizzy spells.",5,5,5
I have had very good results from Diovan. Now my drug company has switched me to a generic and my blood is rising again.  Have to go through all the work of finding another one that works.                                         W hat can we do about the insurance companies? Not a thing!,5,5,5
I have been on Diovan 80 mg for 15 years.  It has controlled my BP and I will continue to use it.  My biggest problem is the cost.  Is valsartin a generic equivalent?  I dont know of side effects.  I am 69 year old male and have attributed weight gain and joint pain to age related problems.,5,5,5
I have been taking several different BP medicines and none seem to keep the BP down. They work for a few days and then it goes up again. I started Diovan about 9 months ago and it seem to work. This is the only medication that keeps my BP under control with no side effects.,5,5,5

Update on discontinuance of Diovan 40 mg. 12.5 mg HCTZ. I first posted about fibromyalgia symptoms resolved. A new and more long term symptom is resolving also. I would describe it simply as tennis elbow in both elbows. Elbows would become sore and inflamed with use especially my right elbow (I am right handed). This was actually the first symptom to appear. I didn't make the connection until it went away after stopping the meds.,5,1,5
"have used this for 5 years and have noticed gradual and then sudden weight gain, as well as muscle spasms in toes and aches in calves. the doctor laughed at my concerns but upon my own research, I have found these to be symptoms.

"Thank God for these reviews. History, 5 bypasses twice in 1998 and 2000.  Multiple stents since then.  I have always been vert susceptible to side effects of all medications  Been on lisinipril for years and had the cough everyone knows about, it kept my BP at a consistent 95/55.  My pharmacy had filled my scrip with a different generic that didn't work well, I mentioned it to my Dr who recommended Diovan to alleviate the cough and add some benefits.  Took it for about 6 weeks and had gradually increasing  multiple symptoms I didn't even realize that were associated until reading online.  Eyes twitching, pain in feet and ankles, runny nose, suddenly very cold nose/hands/feet, weakness (that gradually got worse and worse, and more.   Then the worst part came. Instant severe tiredness and palpitations that made me feel like my heart was stopping.  My blood pressure shot up especially the diastolic (lower number).  Called the dr who wanted me to monitor my BP during episodes and keep diovan but I said screw that.  I had some of the good lisinipril left, I changed immediately.  The most intense side effects disappeared right away although they repeated on and off for days even prompting me to go to the ER.  They had NO ANSWERS which ticks me off now since I had found all of the answers here.   If you stop taking it expect the side effects to last for a lengthy period.  As I write this it has been 9 days and the effects linger although diminished.  Frankly I am feeling better in the last 20 minutes having read through this thread.

"I began taking Diovan 40mg 12.5 mg. hctz about 18 months ago. It controlled my bp well and seemed to have few side effects.  About 6 months ago I began having bouts of all over joint pain usually for short intervals. EVERY joint in my body would ache.

My internist informally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and recommend a rheumatologist if pain did not improve. At my regular cardio appt. I described my symptoms to him, he immediately took me off the drug to see if it would help.  6 days after discontinuing the meds I was virtually pain free and remain so another  week later. If you are diagnosed with fibro or suffer any of these symptoms after beginning the med find a doctor who willhelp you get off this and onto something else while you determine if your symptoms improve.

I took this medication for 5 years and one night when I took it before bedtime I went in antiflactic shock. I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance in near fatal condition. The doctors determinded it was the Diovan and said that can happen with this family of high blood pressure drug and I was taken off Diovan.

"Before anyone takes this drug, they should have a blood test for their ANA level to see if they have an autoimmune disorder.  In 2006, I had NO health issues, but I went to have a mole removed.  I was nervous and had a huge amount of caffeine (coffee and soda) during the day.  So when I got to the Dr. office in the afternoon my blood pressure was really high which I have since learned was because of the caffeine.  Anyway, she put me on Diovan which was new in 2006.  Within a month I started having swelling and pain in my joints.  My knees & ankles hurt and my hands were really swollen and painful.  My daughter told me these sounded like symptoms of Lupus which my dad was diagnosed with when he died in 1993.  When I mentioned this to the doc, she ran a blood test and my ANA was sky-high so I was diagnosed with Lupus and sent to a Rheumatolgist.  Fact is that even though my ANA may have been high, I had NO symptoms of Lupus until I took the Diovan.  I believe it triggered my Lupus symtoms.  I'm no longer on Diovan but now I take Plaquenil for Lupus. The Lupus symtoms didn't subside when I quit taking the Diovan.  Sure wish I had refused the blood pressure med back in 2006.",4,1,1

My doctor asked me if I was taking fish oil (yes, 2 tabs) and she said double it.  My BP went down quite a bit.  Then I switced to 3 women's Mercola krill oil tabs per day, plus CoQ10 and 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 (have this tested) and 2 large cups of green tea per day.  BP went down from 170/90 to 120/70--perfect! As we get older, our bodies suffer more and more irreparable damage from the environment.  You need to find out what is causing your BP to go up and fix it--not gloss over and chemically medicate it.  The American Heart Association is lying on it's website when they claim ""no one knows why a person has high blood pressure."" There are tons of studies out there on natural substances and fixing your diet (no sugar, low carb)to lower your BP, the better your blood sugar is, the better your blood pressure will be, in general.  Get a meter and use it.  Keep your blood sugar in the recommendations of the meter mfgr which are the same as the American Diabetes Assn.  Good luck to you all.",4,2,4

So I am confused as to what is happening to me.  I feel I should only take half the medication again like when I first started out the drug with my doctor at 80 mgs.

"Started taking this medication ONLY 10 days ago and I feel absolutely horrible!!! Since taking Diovan 320 mg I have experienced the following side effects: fatigue, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, and dry heaving. It has lowered my BP from 150/100 to 128/81 but I cannot live and function with these horrible side effects!!! Discontinuing today, my doctor has switched me to Lisinipril 20mg. BE CAREFULE WITH DIOVAN!!!! I HATE IT!!!",1,1,4
"Taken Diovan one per day for over 7 years and reduced to 3 per week 2yrs ago as I was suffering joint pain - unsure as to the cause I looked up side-effects hence my actions. January 2011 B.P raised GP said possibly due to not sleeping due to chronic cough, which I have had for over year as yet undiagnosed. I now have severe pain in my shoulders,neck,knees - feel low, weary,my osteopath thought I should get a blood test as it cold be Polymyalgia - test negative which is good but why have I all this pain? - expect a bit at aged 66 but I have always been active, eat healthily and I have a high pain threshold. Reading these comments on muscle weakness and pain so similar to mine has made me reconsider this drug and I am now reducing it and utilising natural remedies - including meditation - eventually will cease using it - I'll take my chances but at least I'll find out if the cause is the drug. Sometimes I wonder wheher these drugs make us dependent and diminish our natural capacities to address high BP",5,3,4
I have been taking Diovan for 4 years now and my doctor kept me on the medication while I was pregnant in 2007,3,3,3
"Diovan has effectively controlled my HBP, however, the addition of Savella for the treatment of fibromyalgia, has increased both BP and heart rate.

A few days later, my right knee was quite painful.  The next day, I began having severe muscle spasms in both legs.  I would doze off and wake up screaming with the pain and unable to get out of bed! Had to call paramedics.  They gave me a painkiller.  Talk about my blood pressure being elevated!!!! Anyway, after speaking with my doctor, I was told not to take anymore of Diovan.

"I have been well controlled on Atacand for 15 years, but a change in my insurance company made this a pre-authorized drug and they wanted me to follow their protocol and change to a different medication.  My Dr. changed me over to Diovan 80mg once per day.  Within 2 hours started having terriable side effects.  After 3 days of treatment side effects included, choking feeling, pain in left arm and left calf, insomnea and when able to sleep, nightmares and a pounding heart.  I have been put back on Atacand and we are hoping that there is no damage just from the 3 days I was on this medication.  The cost of the Diovan and Atacand are very close.  So I guess I do not understand why it has to be a prior authorized now by my insurance, just because they have changed RX companies. People in offices are messing with my health!  And may have caused damage for a few dollars.  How much more will this cost to correct?  If able to correct! I know that Diovan works well for many people.  And I am thankful that it helps them, but if you are asked to change because of cost?  It is not worth it if you are well controlled on a different medication.... Please beware and keep in touch with your Dr. daily when starting on this medication.",5,1,1

Have been taking 160mg/12.5 HCT for about 3 years.  I am sensitive to sodium and this seems to have controlled it quite well and has brought my BP from moderately high down to normal.  I feel no side effects from it.  I swim fairly strenuously daily in a 1 hour workout for the past 25 years and have noticed no joint ache since starting it.

I had a dull pain in the chest area, this also vanished.  The only symptom that I experience, once in a way, is slight lower back pain, mostly in the night after I have been sleeping for hours.  I thought this had something to do with my kidneys.  Other than that I have no discomfort at all and lost 3 kgs during this time.  I have to confess I started walking regularly as soon as I started taking this medication.  May be that is another reason for not having any joint pain.",4,5,4

"Very happy to read these comments. I am a 49 year old male and have taken Diovan 80MG for several years. I have experienced fatigue and a blase attitude (almost depression like), no muscle pains but very concerning palpitations on occasion. 2 years past I told my doctor about this, went on cardio monitor which revealed nothing...but it still happens on occasion. Libido is reduced too. I am very fit and run 3 miles 3 times a week. ",3,3,3
"I've been on the Diovan for awhile and it is working to lower the blood pressure.  Interesting, the doctors believe it's that ""White Coat Syndrome"" that's causing my problem, as I am deathly afraid of the doctor's office, anything to do with it, ever since my mom passed away.  Plus, I had a very traumatic experience, which I believe initiated my whole fear of the doctor.  Anyway, anyone who gets put on this stuff, stay with it, the side affects eventually subside, did for me!  You want to make sure you take care of yourself, eat well, exercise, get a good night's sleep, and you'll be fine.",5,5,5

"Started taking approx 2 yrs ago.  Noticed arthritic symptoms soon after.  Was diagnosed with possible Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  I saw several Drs for the pain and swelling in my joints.  None of them agreed what was causing it.  This past April, I broke out in hives,had acute renal failure, severe joint pain and spent several days in the hospital, during that time was taken off of diovan.  Joint pain and hives disapeared.  Six weeks later and after starting diovan again joint pain and hives returned causing another stay in the hospital, bu tno renal failure.  This time I convinced my Dr to take  me off of diovan and try something else.  I am now taking Norvasc and for the last six weeks I have had no joint pain, no hives and kydneys are functioning fine.  The diovan was the only common element to both hospital stays.",1,1,1
"This review system does not include race, which is an issue for this drug. One very important fact about this drug is that it may not work well on African-Americans, of which I am one. So, it may not be advised that this drug be used because the natural inclination for the doctor is to 'up' to dosage when another drug might work better with a low dosage. Doctors are too quick to prescribe and then up dosages. This isn't good in the long run due to the effect that drugs have on the liver.",4,1,1

"I forgot to mention something. In addition to improved diet and walking every day, I have been drinking apple cider vinegar in a glass of water once or twice a day. I can't say this has helped normalize my BP without meds, but I don't know that it hasn't. There are numerous websites describing the health benefits of ACV. Check for yourself. If you decide to try it, stir one or two tablespoons of raw organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar with ""mother"" into a full glass of water. (Mother is the name for the little cobwebby nutrients that float in the vinegar.) Bragg is a good brand. So is Hain. If you don't like the vinegar taste, stir in a little honey. I first started doing this to help my irritable bowel but it has the rep for controlling BP as well. Be patient and give it a few weeks; nothing will happen overnight. ",1,1,1
"I posted on 7/21 about getting off Diovan.  I had to do something because the drug was causing unacceptable levels of bowel looseness plus a number of other annoying side effects. I was amazed at how easy it was to normalize my BP by becoming more active and improving my diet. The most important thing I can say here is get off your rear and get moving! Walking is ideal because it is gentle and works almost all your muscles. Start out slow and build up gradually. Start your new program several weeks before attempting to reduce your meds, and then talk to your doc first.",2,1,3
"I stopped taking Diovan about a week ago. Several weeks prior to that, I started walking about a mile a day, every single day, half in the a.m.and half in the p.m. I walk fast enough to be out of breath when I get home. I also improved my diet. More fish & seafood, whole grains, more fruits & vegies, almost no sweets. I feel better than I have in several years with a lot more energy. Saw the doc today for a followup after quitting Diovan. My BP was 124/82 WITHOUT any meds at all. So tonight I celebrate. Bottom line, be sure you really need those drugs. ",3,1,3
I am so glad I found this site- I have been so worried about my health-I have been taking Diovan for over 2 years and for the past 8 months I have been unusally tired and the pain in my lower back is so bad I can't stand at the kitchen sink to do dishes-I have to keep sitting down and thought I needed to see a chiropractor. Making a Dr. appt today. Thanks for letting me know I am not alone.,5,3,3
"I quit taking Diovan and am making major lifestyle changes instead.   If you are plagued with side effects, that means your body hates the stuff and it probably isn't good for you. What good is artificially ""normal"" BP if it's causing so many other problems? People still have strokes & heart attacks while on BP meds.  Better to try to control it naturally and keep the body happy.    Suggestion if BP meds are a must: Try low doses of 2 or even 3 meds rather than high doses of a single med. This is suggested by my cousin who is a pharmacist. He says doing this minimizes side effects.",4,1,1

My doctor prescribed 320mg/12.5 Diovan HCT. I have experienced lower back pain. Muscle spasm and muscle in eye jumping. Dizzyness when standing and numbness in hand and arms at times when sleep.It did lower my pressure but it went back up. Please help with natural suggestion.,2,2,2

"I posted a review last week on 5/13 after my diagnosis. Well - after taking this for a week, my pulse rate has increased and I feel like I have the shakes. Today - I was changed to Avapro (150 mg) and after reading the reviews, this drug is less effective on African Americans so now I have to deal with discrimination of a drug .  Wow - I am gonna lose weight and hopefully do away with all of this. I am now 205 so I lost 6 lbs. (probably water), I have started exercising and also changing my diet.  With the help of God -- this will be done! The doctor feels that the diuretic part is what is giving me the shakes but overall, my BP decreased from 144 / 92 to 117 / 78 (today)... so it may work for some but not for me! ",5,1,2
Switched from Lisinopril to Diovan (Big price difference) 2 years ago due to cough. Have seen good results although I get light headed and server headaches. When i exercise then wait 1 hour prior to taking later in the day I will get extreme headaches that knock me down for several hours. On the days I do not exercise no headaches? I plan on cutting dosage and watch BP. Otherwise beside price it has worked.,4,3,4
I was just diagnosed today and I am somewhat in doubt and just frightened. I received Diovan and I took the first pill. I am scheduled to take for 1 month and review with doc. I plan on losing weight because I do not want to take this for the rest of my life. My BP today was 144 / 90 and I am 44 yrs old and 211 lbs. Dr. advised me to lose weight and that is where I stand (presently).  One visit to the Dr. or BP check should not confirm such a condition.. ,5,1,1
"Took my first dose of 160 mg accompanied with Toporol 25 mg at night (also take 1 toporol 25 during the day). Doctor switched me to this med because of bad side effects from lisinopril. Within 2 hours of taking the Diovan, I developed itching. First on head then hands, arms and legs followed. I am calling doctor tomorrow. This sure is frusterating! No other symptoms from diovan to report, but then again, it is only 5:00 and first dose was taken at 1:00.",5,1,1
I find the price of the medication keeps going up too much! And there is no generic here in the USA although it has been on the market manny years now but there is a generic in Canada. WHY?,5,5,5

"My doctor put me on Lisinpril initially; it made me cough so much, I stopped taking it. She then put me on diovan, 160 Mg's per day, then doubled it.  It brought my bp down, but not low enough. Being an herbalist, I looked into an Ayurvedic formula called Mutka Vati-this works like a charm!  I'm still on meds, after finding the correct dosage of both; brought my bp down to 115/75, which is exactly where I want it.  I will bring this to my doctor and tell her I want off these meds.  I am constantly exhausted while on it, and I don't want to be dependent on meds.  Mukta Vati can be found on ebay, google the term and Ivy's is the brand I bought.  Very satisfied with it!!",4,2,4
"I've been taking Diovan for 7 years now..  gradually over time I've had to increase my dosage.. I'm now on 320 mg. This drug has given me all the side effects: headache, loss of sex drive, fatigue, back pain, extreme leg pain, leg tingles/numbness, muscle pain, jitters, and muscle spasms.   However, it has done a great job in controlling my BP. I was 225/110 and now I'm 120/75. If you can deal with the exhaustion, it's a great medication and will DEFINITELY work.",4,4,4
"If I didn't have to work I could deal with the side effect of lethargy, back pain and my calves are sore all the time. I also take lisinopril and catapres.

"I was on the 80mg Diovan and it failed to lower my blood pressure. Dr changed me to the 180 and was working fine for a couple weeks. After 3 week, I started to feel muscle pain in my legs, my jaw started hurting, felt my skin itch, increased heart rate and started to feel jittery/anxiety. Going to the doctor tomorrow to get a new prescription.  Are there are natural alternatives to Diovan?",4,1,3
"Tried this out after finding out that Benicar was not a preferred drug on my insurance. Did fine for about a week but for feeling alittle light headed. But soon my left lower back and right heel were killing me. Could barely walk more less exercise. Doctor said the pain was not related. She switched me to Lisinopil because of the dizziness with pressure reading 96/55 (was 159/89). She told me to start with 5mg, I'm starting at 2.5 and monitor my pressure at home. I've been free of Diovan for a day and my back/heel is already SO much better! Thanks everyone for your reviews.",5,2,5
"I went to the doctor for severe headaches at the back of my head and neck.  Blood pressure WAY high - 200/100 ! Scary.  Diovan 160 did not help.  Changed to Diovan 320 and been on that for a year.  No side effects.  Keeps my BP ""normal"" - last doctor visit 120/80.",5,5,5

Have been taking Diovan for about three years. I have to keep increasing the dose. Started with 80 mg. Went to 160 mg. Now on 320 mg. It's been keeping my numbers at good levels. Feel a little tired at times but would never consider dropping Diovan.,5,4,4
Satisfied with drug,5,5,5
"Fatigue, muscle and joint pain, still high heart rate, HAIR LOSS.  Does anyone else suspect hair loss from high blood pressure medications?  Diovan does lower blood pressure, though, but who wants a bald head unnecessarily so.",3,3,3
I had a coughing effect from the drug,5,3,4
"I've been on Diovan for 2 years and it has controlled my BP well.  I have experience lower back pain, fatigue, and chronic sinusitis.  I'm now considering discontinuing the Diovan to see if it alleviates my sinus issues, otherwise it has worked well.",4,3,4
Previously took Lisinopril which caused severe coughing daily and loss of voice. Diovan eliminated the cough completely. My concern is the cost of this brand Rx is quadrupled that of Lisinopril. I am looking for a generic alternative that does not cause severe coughing.,5,5,5
"Headache,nausa,heartburn,dizzness,musle weakness and pain,joint pain, after taking 60mg for 10days became confused with numbness in fingers and toes, agatated.

"My blood pressure was excessively high 200/90.  My doctor prescribed 160 mg 1 X per day.  Within a week my BP was significantly reduced.  After 5 months my BP hovers around 117/76.

"I took this drug for 3 or 4 years.  It lowered my blood pressure pretty well but I had to increase the dosage to 80 mcg (I'm very sensitive to drugs) about a year ago.  I gradually started to feel worse and worse, with my back aching and soon my joints and muscles.  I couldn't exercise without 3 days of really sharply sore muscles.  I told my doctor about the sore back and joints and muscles and was told that ""It's part of getting old"".  But it wasn't.  I finally pulled/tore a ligament and muscle in my shoulder and needed Physical Therapy.  Through all of these sore backs and joints and muscles, I was taking Ibuprofen just to function in my daily life.  My doctor ran my blood tests and my liver function tests were bad.  Bad enough that she took me off of Diovan.  It was like a weight was lifted from my shoulders--within 2 days I could get out of bed without hobbling when I started to walk.  My back started to feel better. My shoulder began to heal.  I could exercise and not be sore for 3 days. I don't need Ibuprofen anymore. My normal energy level has returned. And my liver function tests are getting better.      I should have insisted that my doctor take me seriously when I told her my muscles and joints and back hurt and that the hurt was different from sore muscles, much sharper.  Plus, what good is a drug if you need an NSAIDS to tolerate it's effect on your body.  Hopefully my liver is not permanently damaged!  ",4,1,4
"I started with 160mg and had to go up to 320mg. 320mg did the job very well. I tried diet, exercise, but the only thing than helped me was medication, I used to be > 160/95, now i'm hovering around 125/85. I had no side effects at all, at least not yet, I'm 32, and have been on this for 3 years.",5,5,5

"I was first given enalapril. This worked fairly well, but my physician was concerned about my 'dry cough'. I was changed to Valsartan (80mg). This did not affect my (labile but often high) BP. Another physician increased the dose to 160 mg per day. This has made no difference. The side-effects are very slight (slight gastric distress). Will need to consider alternatives. (Magnesium supplementation seems to help, as does a low dose of Diazepam and massage as well as Coenzyme Q10.)Valsartan is expensive and does not work for me. The original physician did not like the idea of Thiazide diuretics (he was concerned about metabolic disturbances. Perhaps I should concentrate on 'life-style' changes? I am currently in a sedentary and stressful job.    ",5,1,1
I had no symptoms od Hypertension until I had my B.P.taken at a Health Fair. My physician put me on this drug because it worked for him I have had no problems except I had to be put on a beta-blocker also.,5,5,4

"Have been on Diovan 80mg for 3+ years. No problems except dystolic stayed high. Added amlodipine 2.5 mg 2 weeks ago. Combination of meds seem to have brought on dizziness, feeling faint, low energy, & rapid hair loss. BP under control, side effects increasing stress level. Not sure the combo is what I need.",4,4,4
"I feel a slight sense of tiredness on this medication, but not enough to consider requesting a change.",4,4,5

"I have been on 180mg. of diovan for about 3weeks.  I have dreams all night and wake up feeling groggy.  I had the same experience with lisinopril.  I almost dread going to sleep at night.  However, I have felt o.k. during the day.",2,2,2
Started on Avalide 10 yrs ago and worked fine but my doctor chose Lisinopril since it was free for me on my insurance - terrible cough all day and night long.  Changed to Diovan and seems to be working though I would like to see my numbers a bit lower.  It's been only a few months and I'll give it a few more to see if there's a change.,5,4,4
"My BP dropped from about 150/90 to 116/60. I was on Lisinopril and had horrible side effects(tiredness, muscle pain, no sex drive, bad cough). So far things are better with Diovan. I am slightly tired on Diovan, but nothing too bad at all. ",3,3,4
"hands and feet very cold, finger tips senitive and rurn a yellowish color sometime",5,3,4
"Have been taking for about 3 months now. Started with 80mg, had problems. Among the worst was extremely agitated. Got upset, felt like blood rushing to my head, felt like something was about to happen. Had to lay down to calm down. Reduce the amount to 40mg and kind of tolerating it. Headaches, muscle weakness and pain, head whirling, sinus aches daily and infections, back pain. BP not reduced so far as much as would like. I think I need an internist doctor??",5,3,3
Have been on 80mg 2wk and lowered bp from 150/100 to 126/85. Also take ioomg ToprolXL daily.Have not noticed any negative side effects.,5,4,4
"I was on this drug for approximately 3 months.  It helped to lower my blood pressure a little bit, but not enough, so Dr. increased dosage.  Blood pressure started going back up, acquired a weight gain from an increased appetite and a very strange dry, scabby rash on my lower back and stomach.  Biggest problem with this drug was the ""hangover"" type of effect I had every morning when I tried to get up.  I don't drink alcohol or do other drugs at all.  Dr. has now switched me over to Lisinopril which is working quite well - some side effects but not like with Diovan.",5,1,2
"There may be other factors inhibiting rhe full response expected from Diavan, like, not strong enough, which I have to discuss with my Dr.",5,3,3

I am Diabetic, type 2, and she just prescribed Glipizide...had me discontinue Triam, and the latest RX states 2 Diovan 80 mg. per day, plus 1/2 80 mg pill in evening. My blood pressure is under control; so I question why the large increase in dosage.",5,5,5
Had earlier tried taking the 320mg. Very bad results so tried the 80mg. Was only able to be on for 1 week. Chest felt like I was having asthma continuosly without the wheezing.  So took myself off the med and went back to Atenolol which I was also on at the same time. Will see what dr. tries next.,4,1,1
"I take this medicine to prevent hypertension since I have kidney disease and hypertension would only further my disease.  It has worked great in protecting my kidneys, however the swelling of my feet, ankles and lower legs has made my life hell when it acts up.  My doctor is positive its the diovan causing my edema, but since my father had kidney disease that led him to a transplant, my doctor is putting the kidneys first and my swollen legs second.",4,3,4
"My Dr. has Rx'd Diovan HCT 320 for high blood pressure.  It somewhat works for that, but REALLY EFFECTS my asthma!  I have coughing spells that are out of control!  So, I did my own on-line research and found the side effects are worse than the high blood pressure!  It seems that ALOT of the Rx'd meds have MORE side effects that are much worse than the original problem!!!  Whether it was smart or not, I stopped taking Diovan on my own because the coughing was so bad!!!  However, I will be contacting my Dr with my decision.  ",3,1,3
"I HAVE BEEN ON DIOVAN FOR TEN YEARS AND HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS. RECENTLY HAD A HEAT ATTACK AND WAS PUT ON COREG ALONG WITH DIOVAN 40.  MY STOMACH HAS BEEN EXTREMELY UPSET AND SWELLS UP WITH SO MUCH BLOATING WITH EITHER FOOD OR WATER.  FIRST I WENT OFF THE COREG, DIDN'T HELP.  THEN I WENT OFF THE DIOVAN AND THE STOMACH PROBLEMS WENT AWAY TWO DAYS LATER.  I'VE HAD SCANS, UPPER GI, AND LOWER WHICH HAS SHOWN NOTHING WRONG.  THESE TWO DRUGS DID NOT FAIR WELL TOGETHER AND THE DIOVAN DID NOT PREVENT A HEART ATTACK.  I ALSO HAD LEG PAINS AND MANY JOINT ACHES DURING THE YEARS WHILE TAKING DIOVAN.  ",1,1,1
"Dr. for some reason started me on the 320 mg. My reaction was severe spiking 200/101 and dropping to 112/59 2 hours after taking pill.  My chest started hurting and I began gasping for breath with movement. Spent most of my time in a chair. After 1 week I stopped pill myself.  Dr. then gave me the 80 mg and I am doing fine. No side effects, but b/p not dropping as fast as we would like so I will probably agree to take the next step up.",5,2,3
"I took Diovan 160 for five days.  On the fifth day, I felt dizzy in the morning, then in the afternoon my heart began racing.  I called my MD who at first thought I was having a panic attack, but I have never had one before.  My body temperature dropped to 97.  Then my feet turned white.  I felt very cold all over and shivered for the whole five days.  I also became sensitive to light and sound.  The left side of my face and my left foot became numb, which lessened, but did not disappear even after I stopped the Diovan.  ",3,1,1

"I've been on this medication for about five months now.  It really helped to lower my b.p., but when my dosage was changed from 80 mg everyday to 40 mg everyday, I've noticed that my bp has been slightly elevated.  I feel jittery sometimes and my heart rate goes up way too easily.  Has anyone else experienced this?",5,4,4
"BP: 190/80 Prescribed 180mg, 1.5 week later BP 135/80. Did not like the $40 co-pay! Told Doc and she gave me several sample packs of 320mg and said I could double the pills I have left to make 320mg. I am trying to save not increase dose. Will cut 320mg in half to 180mg. So far, only slight headaches.",5,4,4
"Couldn't handle the 160 mg.  Can only equate the side effects as making me feel like I was in the first trimester of pregnancy, minus the vomiting.  Total exhaustion.  80 mg seems to be tolerable.",3,3,3
"Started on 40mg 6 months ago.  No side effects but did not control my BP 4 weeks ago, Dr. doubled to 80mg. Have had persistent HA, fatigue,joint pain, foot, lower back, neck and rt. arm pain. Fingers on right hand swollen.  Relayed these side effects to my Dr.-she prescribed migraine med. This is my second ACE inhibitor-both causing bad reactions. ",3,1,3
"I've been on Diovan for about 3 months. It does control my BP but, there are drawbacks. Switched to taking it at night due to the fatigue it was causing (couldn't keep my head off my desk at work.)  When I take at night, it is like taking a sleeping pill - until the dieretic kicks in.  I am typically up several times a night to use the bathroom now.  I suppose there is a perfect time of day to take this med but, I have yet to find it.",5,2,4
"I have been taking this medication for about 6-8 months and it has only controlled my blood pressure for part of the day.

As soon I stopped, have loose the same, 2 pounds each months, for a year, I am now my same weight I was when I started taking the Diovan.  I was a PPA patient.",3,1,1
"Diovan(80mg)along with Toprol worked wonderfully at keeping my BP under control. Just an FYI, it did give me nightmares almost every night!  I know it was the diovan, because less than a week of going off of it due to trying to get pregnant, my nightmares completely stopped (and i'm still on the toprol). For me it was worth it though, as it kept my BP low.",5,4,5
"Been on this med for over two years and have developed leg cramping, joint pain, feet swelling, and gout diagnosis.

"Have just been on 40 mg. diovan for a week. Have been experiencing very bad leg pain.

"Started out taking the HCT Diovan but it was too strong, made my arms go numb during sleep. Switched to the regular 160mg Diovan with better results. It has made me dizzy at times but it has been tolerable. When squatting be careful when standing, some dizziness may occur, it does with me.

It worked for my blood pressure.,4,4,4
Type 1 diabetic (18yrs) with insulin pump and have been using this suggested by my endocrinologist for the last few years to help kidneys work easier. Alot of doctors who treat diabetics suggest using an ace inhibitor to help with diabetic renal issues but I tried ACE inhibitors and got really really dizzy all the time. I do not have high blood pressure but he seems to think that this ARB as its called works good by taking stress off kidney function. I cannot really claim any serious side affects from it other then sometimes my ankles swell ( end of day ) thats it. No cough or anything like that for me. You might ask your MD about it as an alternative to an ARB if you get really dizzy though...it worksed for me great no problems. ,5,4,4

I was discharged 6 days after surgery, full recovery within 10 days, bp remained steady at 140/80 consistantly for two years. My Family Practice MD changed the Lotensin to Diovan 7 months ago. My bp is all over the place, cannot keep anything on down, have lost almost 75 lbs, cannot stand, have developed Orthostatic Hypotension (bp drops upon standing) so bad that I have fallen twice requiring sutures/stapes, several other times not as serious. The change was due to post-nasal drip. Now the problem has become critical, but nobody believes that the symptoms started 7-10 days after starting the Diovan. I have never suffered from stomach cramps this bad in my life, even with diverticulosis/litis. I know this is the problem, but I cannot get my MD to agree. I have not been able to hold anything on my stomach for longer than 20-30 mins after eating, even water. My feet look like they're going to explode!

I'd like to know more concerning the inter relatedness of the various scores.",5,5,5

Every morning my eyes would water for hours and my dry nose was so painful inside that I had to apply petroleum jelly several times a day.

Dr. doubled dosage yesterday to 160mg/day.(no previous side effects except slight weight gain) Today I have a terrible headache and feel achy all over.  I don't know if is from increased dosage or not. ",5,4,3

Side effects I experience: 12 pound weight gain in the first 2 months, muscle pain and weakness especially after being on my feet for awhile, overall feel more tired, and more frequent acid reflux. Not sure if this medication is worth taking.",5,2,4

I have been on Diovan for apprx 6mths (chngd from Lisinopril-bad cough)and have experienced chronic reflux issues, extreme hairloss and thinning, weight gain (very active 39 yr old female slightly overweight)joint pain, (knees creek and crack) slight libido change,but overall, BP has stabilized. Now the question is...with all the side effects,is there another, just as effective medication available?  Your reviews have really helped me narrow down the cause of my symptoms.  Thanks WebMd and the many reviewers.",4,3,4
"have been on Diovan for 3years,have back pain,cramps in my legs sometimes at night i wake up with the chills shaking all over,i have tried to take it at different times of the day,helps for awhile but the cramps start again",3,1,3
I've been on it for a while and my blood pressure is doing fine. It helps to drink a lot of fluids with this medicine. When I take the pill I follow with a full glass of water and usually drink about 4 more glasses throughout the day. It seems like a lot to drink but it helps to keep the headaches away.,5,5,4
PB was controlled with previous meds.  I have been on this medication along with water pills and my BP is still 159/95,4,1,1
"I am taking Divan 320/25 mg,  I understand that drinking water after taking the drug helps?  Is this correct?  If yes, how much should I drink",5,3,3

"59 year old caucasian with 10 year history of HTN. Was on 2.5 mg of Vasotec, but it stopped working three months ago (a lot to stress). MD put me on 320 mg of Diovan ... all hell broke loose: severe abdominal cramping; felt like I was getting an ulcer with gastic burning; explosive and watery stools; extreme fatigue; weak as a kitten (I was an Olympic lifter in my youth and am still very strong ... before Diovan); chest congestion; very runny nose; cannot make sense of a simple newspaper article (I have five graduate degrees); very cold extremities; and memory dysfunction. MD told me there would be no side effects! I hate this stuff! I will cut my dose to 80mg for the next week. I'd rather have the HTN. Be very cautious with this stuff (Diovan).",1,1,3
Reduced high blood pressure,5,5,5
I felt extremely great when I first started taking the medication.After about 3 weeks I started getting severe headaches that would last up to all day.They usually begin after about half hour to hour after taking it. The blood pressure has really dropped to normal readings and my heart rate has superceded all my expectations in descending by 15 points. This medication was prescribed for hypertension but I am concerned about the headaches since I'm not one prone to them there has also been a small amount of muscle cramping in the calves.The drug works well but I would stay in close contact with my physician and my pharmacist.,4,2,5
Take 80mg twice daily-could not tolerate the 160mg at one time.,4,5,4
"It has slowly lowered my blood pressure. I also used to get head aches, but when you take diovan, you have to drink a LOT of water or you will have head aches. It helps to drink stuff like gatorade or vitamin water or other fluids containing potassium to get rid of leg/muscle cramps, in spite of what it says on the ""drug interactions"" part.",3,3,3
since I started taking it I have had a severe headache. my eyes and the top of my head hurt severly please help.,3,1,2

"INSURANCE COMPANT  DOES NOT WANT ME TO USE IT AS TOO EXPENSIVE,WANTS ANOTHER MEDICINE TO BE USED",5,1,4
This is the first time in 9 years that I have had to increase it. But this is due to some other conditions.  I prefer this over the Avapro which made me constantly cough. I have never had any side affects from this.  ,5,5,5
gave me rreally itchy rash  scared for life on entire body,3,1,1
"the blood pressure's been impressively lowered, but seem to have lots of fatigue, back pain, and joint aches with this med. Liked ToprolXL but developed a nasty cough and had to discontinue. Norvasc caused lots of swelling in lower extremities. Guess the Diovan is the best so far but would like to get rid of the back and joint pain that seems to be a side effect of the med. The 10 pound weight gain hasn't made me a fan of this med, either, but dropping the systolic pressure from 237 to 130 is pretty impressive. ",4,3,4
What are side effects when I stop taking Diovan?,5,5,5
I was put on Diovan for my high blood pressure and it really didn't help. I had tried an ACE inhibitor before Diovan and was taken off of that due to a cough. My doctor kept increasing the dose but my blood pressure remained high. My doctor switched me to Avalide 300/12.5 and my blood pressure is finally controlled. I'm happy with the new drug and it's working much better. I only have to take the Avalide once a day which is much better Diovan twice daily.,1,1,1
cough,5,3,2
Got hives on my neck & itching around my eyes esp with the Diovan HCT.  Systolic BP was around 125 - 135 but diastolic was a little high at 85 to 90.  Got periodic dizziness that was enough to affect my work performance. Ceased taking the Diovan HCT after 30 days as I got angry red itchy welts on my neck. Switched to regular Diovan & welts went away but the itchiness remained around eyes & dry somewhat itchy flat rash replaced the welts.  Discontinued after 2 months.,5,1,1

I'm in good shape; bike and windsurf all the time.  Feel great, no side effects now, but in the beginning, I was a bit tired in the afternoon. Have been taking Diovan for 2.5 months.  No other meds.",5,4,4
Diovan is not lowering the pressure like it was,5,3,5
"I am taking Toprol XL for high blood pressure which spikes too high. I have AFib and also take digoxin and coumadin. My doctor prescribed Diovan to help lower my BP since the Toprol was not keeping it low enough. After taking the Diovan for almost 2 weeks, I resumed getting heart palpitations(which have been minimal since starting ther other meds last June, 2007). Is this a known side effect of Diovan? I certainly do not want to continue to take it and have to deal with the palpitations again.",2,1,2

I would recommend this to anyone who has been through all of the insurance company approved drugs that I have tried. I take a dose of maxide with it as it appears that water retention is one of the causes of my hbp.  Nothing bad to say at all, except for BCBS telling me they won't pay for it as they want me to try alternative therapy.  However, I won't give it up.",5,5,5
Great drug! :),5,5,5

Currently taking a low dose 12.5 mg.  For the most part it has been very effective except when in the Dr. office. Started taking my own blood preasure daily and realized how well it was working.  I also use the Resperate breathing program and feel that is how I get by on such a low dose of Diovan,5,4,4

"I was started on the 40mg and my pressure dropped slightly, now I am taking 80mg and I have feel better  that I have in a while.",5,5,5
"Controls by BP great, but having terrible back pain and sometimes strange taste in mouth.",4,2,3
Caused chronic kidney problems and gout - before taking it I had none of these problems. Not recommended!!,2,1,1
"Did not control BP well, hard to get below 150 systolic. Fatigue an issue.  Leg cramps an issue.  Worst, was the eczemma/red circles of peeling skin around both eyes--which took months to finally figure out that this drug was the culprit.   ",5,1,2
"feeling sick to my stomach, awful taste im my mouth.feel like a z0mbie.  Pill works but the side effects are awful",1,1,5
started edarbi 5 days ago due to weight gain from previous med. Gained 3 pounds in 5   days on Edarbi had severe pain in right side and lower back.  Unable to sleep due to pain.  Will call Dr. today and stop taking.,5,1,1
"After many years of different drugs for high B/P without great success, doctor put me on 80 mg of edarbi.  By the fifth day I was so weak I could hardly stand without holding on to something - incredible muscle fatigue with accompanying bouts of abdominal, back, and leg cramps/spasms. Six days later when it was still present and life altering, I phoned the doctor to report that I could not go on like this. She told me to take 1/2 tablet and monitor and let her know on Monday (a week from call) then she called back to say maybe it was the Paleo diet I was on.  I did not believe that for a moment as I am eating healthier than I have in years. AND I saw the reports here of the same issues I was having. It brought my B/P down dramatically - even low - so it works on the issue, but if these awful side effects do not go away by reducing to 1/2 tab, I will refuse to stay on this medication.",3,2,3
Blew my bp thru the roof. Prescribed when systolic was 160 range. Came off it after dose was doubled and bp by rose to 200/112 range necessitating an ER visit. Switched to Amlodipine and BP is now in 140 to 150/90 range. Edarbi = bad drug for me!,4,1,1
Have been in the red zone on the BP chart for years and have tried all kinds of meds to get my pressure down.  I was part of the last test trial group.  First response was I was dizzy because for the first time I had actual mid range BP.  I have now been back on it with my first actual normal BP rating.  This drug has saved my life by actually letting me get to a normal range.  I figure the complaints have been because the blood pressure they where lowering was not that high.  After years of being around 170 Systolic and very little time at the 130 range I would say again this drug has saved my life.  With the increase in potassium from this drug for once I got to cut out the added RX to help with how many BP meds remove this from your system.  I do get dizzy still but I have a lot of other health issues that now I do not have to include high BP to.  I take it at bed time with and without food. Most doctors do not know about this medicine.  I would recommend it for anyone with extremely high pressure but be careful if not. ,5,5,5
Have been taking for 3 weeks and also am experiencing Reynaud's syndrome which is not listed as a side effect.  Noticed one other person also listed this side effect.,5,4,5
"I have been taking Edarbi 80mg a day for about 6 months along with 2 other BP drugs. When my doctor started me on Edarbi my BP returned to a normal level within a couple of days and the hard pounding sensation I had with my heart went away. I have been on many different BP medications over the years but this is the only one that has satisfied me and my doctor. I currently take 80mg Edarbi, 10mg Amlodipine, 150mg Toporol. The Edarbi is the only one of these medications BCBS of Florida will not pay for and it works the best.",5,5,5
this medication has worked great for me. I was hospitalized 3 times in 3 months with high blood pressure. Nothing worked. My dr put me on edarbi and my blood pressure is perfect. ,5,5,5
"This is the 8th drug now I have been given to try to reduce my high BP.  Worked finally after about 2 weeks.  But then I started to get severe joint and muscle pain, starting in my most used joints ( driving leg knee, and left shoulder- I am left handed) Also sometime uncontrolable bowel movements.  Came off as an experiment, and symptoms subsided within 2 days.  Went back on and almost immediatly soreness came back.  I guess its back to the drawing board......",2,1,4
helps but Edarbi alone does not lower Blood pressure enough ,4,3,4
"Been on the medication for 4 weeks. Effective at reducing my high blood pressure. I takes so many other meeds its hard to tell the side effects. I have experenced light headedness and fatigue but nothing I cant work through. I have sleep apnea and I am also a COPD patiant. So far I am pleased with the results. I have been using samples from the doctor and sence has precribed  40 mg daily. If anything changes, I will re-rate the product. I am 56 years old and 230 lbs, I do not excersize and I dont diet. I work 10-12 hour days and drink 2-3 oz of bourban nightly. I know bad habit. My gole is to drop the weight so I dont have to take this. I have been suffering high BP for only 3 months. Hope this helps. ",5,5,5
"Two weeks on. 175/108 bp so just not working for me. My hopes were high, but back where I started. There has to be something...... ",1,1,1
I have been using this for two yrs and it works great. I now only take 10mg once a day and it seems to be leveling out but doctor should take me off in a few months. I have lost 30+ lbs and work out five days a week and will be 60 soon.....,5,5,5
Edarbi worked amazingly well to reduce my extremely high blood pressure and I have experienced zero side effects.  I would recomment anyone with high blood pressure to ask their doctor to try this treatment.,5,5,5
I have developed quite painful reynaud's syndrome since taking this drug and wonder if anyone else has. it is not listed as a side effect.,5,3,5
"this has been much better than my original Rx. unfortunately my insurance forces me to choose a different Rx - losartan - starting 1/1/14. never had a problem, and bp is at all time low.",5,5,5
"it lowered my blood pressure drastically, I have to reduce the dosage (80 mg) twice to achieve a reasonable BP (120/70)",5,4,5
"My Dr. gave me this medicine knowing full well I have renal stenosis and kidney stent. My BP shot up real figh, my heart was palpatating and more. I nearly was killed by this medicine. I am writing to the FDA about it!!!!",1,1,1
Very good For controling high blood pres. sure beatería tan Andy other medicine THAT i have taken,5,5,5
BP went from 165/110 to 128/88 within a week. A little light-headed but worth it v. high blood pressure. ,5,5,5
Taking Edarbi for 5 months.  I have have been light headed and dizzy most of the time.  The last few have had chronic diarrhea. I also have had trouble with BP becoming very low.  ,5,2,5
"Been on Edarbi 40mg. for 6 months.  I also take Bystolic 40mg. (max dosage)- together, these do the trick.  One problem after about 16 hours in a 24 hour day, BP tends to go from: 100/70 to 189/110.  Edarbi will indeed: (1) itchy skin & head like rash, (2) difficult with Heavy Breating (3) stomach churning (4) weakness in: hips, legs, back, arms (5) swelling in ankles and feet (6) a empty of bowel through out day (7) brain fog (8) minor cough like (Lisinopril) (9) weight gain like (Lyrica) (10) Erectile Dysfunction (Male).  NOTE: IF YOU CAN ONLY USE 40MG. (DO SO) EDARBI COMES IN 40MG. & 80MG.  Note:  Edarbi has alot of side effects, but over time depending on individual they will become less bothersome. This is the newest BP Medication on market currently.  USE WITH CAUTION !!",5,3,5
iat first it was the perfect med. now i just got out of the hospital due to a very low blood p reading 70 over 45. even though i reduce the dos to third . finally the hospital dr and other dr statd that this med dos indeed lower your blood pressure rating too muich. the only one refuseaccept the fact is the heart Dr. he dos not get it he want to keep saling and promoting this new med. i spend two day at the hospital because of this med lower the heart blood pressure all sudden withourt any warninig,3,4,4
At first BP went down then you could not tell a big difference.  She starting having chest pain.  She is also taking clonidine and the two together is just not bringing it down where it should be.  Other than the chest pain and tiredness no major issues.,4,3,4
"5’8 280lbs 42%bf.  Been using Edarbi 40mg for 6 months.(80mg cut in haft) Works just like its supposed too.. I do notice more urination but very clear, who knows this could be from the  bystolic 5mg, (10mg cut in haft) I was started on both at the same time.  Had 145/100 blood pressure now I run about 124/73. If I would  try a better diet, and exercise I would not need either. Something I’ll work on right after this bag of chips and movie. I must say, nether pill helps with motivation.  ",4,4,4
"was taking another drug that wasn't working dr. added edarbi, started at 80mg, blood pressure dropped to low 90/60. cut dose in half to 40mg and dropped other drug. Pressure is great always around 120/80. But side effects for me are tiredness, brain fog and difficulty in concentration. sometimes short term memory loss. Dr thought maybe i have alzheimers. but symtoms go away when stop taking edarbi for a few days.  Doctors dont seem to want to believe that side effects are a problem. going to keep taking until i see a new cardiologist .",5,3,5
"I am taking 40 mgs. of Edarbi and have reduced it to one tab every other day, as one a day was causing some dizziness and fatigue. The current program is effective and effects are more tolerable.  I check pressure regularly and this dose is doing the job. Doctor okayed this.",5,4,5
immediately lowered bp no side efects                  ,5,5,5
Three weeks on edarbi 40. BP went down immediately. Unfortunately I have developed a very dry cough and rash over my face and throat. I will call my doctor tomorrow. It worked so well I hope there is a remedy.,5,3,5
"been on it for 2 months 80 mg ,I have expiriance  dizzines  when getting up , fatige when barely doing any type of activity such as going  up stairs. chest disconfort  (asthma like sensation) to the point that i will go see the doct tomorrow it feels like angina from what i beeen told. I'm scare. My blood pressure is excellent now no other pill ever worked but i dont know if what im feeling is a side effect. Im 5.8 tall and 160 lbs  my cholesterol is high and I do take cholesterol pills too. ",5,2,5
does not seem to make a difference,5,1,2
190/98 start on for a year always around 119/79. No complications. Easy to use drug. Benicar HCT and Micardis did not touch my BP. Caremark covers it I pay next to nothing for this drug.,5,5,5
"I have had high blood pressure for 15 years.  I am petite, I exercise 3 - 4 times a week and I eat a healthy diet. I have tried every family of BP medicine, and they all seem to have side effects. My goal is to find the medicine that has the least side effects and keeps my BP down. I have been taking Edarbi for 4 months. I take a 1/4 of a tablet and my BP readings are very good, sometimes too low which has never happened in the past. Side effects are muscle pain (primarily in my hands and wrists), weight gain(approximatley 8 - 10 pounds), and intense hot flashes. These side effects are minimal compared to other BP drugs so I will do my best to stay on this medicine. ",5,3,5
Been on for a year. Lowest blood pressure in three years. First few months experenced dizziness but that passed. Am currently having muscle spasms in upper arms and joint pain in the hip area. Also having trouble with pain while walking.  Having my annual physical in three weeks will talk to doctor about spasms and joint pain.    ,5,4,5
Blood pressure dropped from 171/99 to 103/66 in a matter of days. Only two problems (1) insurance won't cover it once the free samples run out (2) it gives me the weirdest dreams (not scary just oddball),5,4,5
Severe stomach issues and muscle spasms.,4,1,1
"just started, has reduced my BP markedly better than Micardis",5,5,5
just started medication after 48 hours of 40mg /day  avg of eight BP readings per day  109 systolic/52 diastolic w/pulse at 55bpm,5,4,4
"Light headed, black out when I stand up too fast. Muscle spasms.",5,2,3
"I use no drugs except for high BP. I have tried most of the ones on the market, side effects of rashes, cough, muscle spasms, blurred vision.  During 8 weeks without ANY BP drugs, my BP ranged 135/65 - 180/80 and I felt great. After 4 wks Edarbi 40m, BP now ranges from 170/90 to 116/50 within minutes. Frequent hot flushes, diarrhea, muscle aches, dizziness, very diminished sense of smell and taste, and fatigue.  Not happy with this one, either.",5,1,2
"I have been on edarbi for about 8-9 months. It really brought my BP down..sometimes too low,but started a hacky cough,feeling of vomiting, muscle spasms that were awful,painful joints,weakness,very tired,cough getting out of hand,and not tolerable.Urination weakness,and all around feeling awful. Medicare won't pay for it either. ",5,1,3
the problem is it only comes with 80 mg it should have lower dos. most of the time my blood pressure droped too much so i had to cut the bill in a half. at first has sever mussel weaknes and spasm now most of it it gone. also the other problem is that medicare dos not accept this medication so i had to keep getting samples from the dr,5,4,4
"I have been on edarbi 80mg for about 3 weeks it has lowered my blood pressure but it also cause me to have severe muscle pain in my chest and back so much I couldn't hardly breath, as a result I have had to come off the medication because the pain was unbareable....",5,1,5
"Passing fecal matter multiple times per day, including it leaking out.  Several times each week the diarrhea would explode from my body with little advance warning. resulting in major bathroom clean-ups.  Gained fifteen pounds in the four months on it; ravenously hungtry/Persistent cough.",4,1,4
my diastolic was always in the low 90s.  edarbi has been the prescription to help.  now my number in in the low 70s. i am so happy with this medication,4,4,4
Experienced severe dizziness and no lowering of blood pressure. Also muscle and joint pain on first day.,1,1,1
"I'm considered a petite female and my BP has always been 120/80. After age 45 my BP started to rise and stayed around 140/90, even with proper weight, exercise and diet.  Now, after 2 months my BP is around 115/73.  I feel much better these days.",5,4,5
Not much change with BP . Coused a problem with erectile function .Contacting the Dr. today to change to another med.,1,1,2
Has not lower my blood pressure and causes chronic constipation.,2,1,1
"This medication was given to me by my Primary Care physician  and had taken it for about three months. At first it controlled my BP and shortly threafter I began experiencing headaches, developed body rashes and finally urine retention. He thinks I should continue taking it and I refused to to do so. I had to be straight cath in the ER and must now followup with a Urologist.",2,1,2
"I've been on Edarbi 40mg tabs for almost 2 weeks,my BP is still not stable,sometimes dropping to 99/66,also my stomach has been cramping as if I need have a bowel movement or the feeling that I might have diarrhea.The doctor said to stay on the med. ",3,1,3
"one a day, easy    no side effects",5,5,5
"My Dr switched me from Benicar HCT to Edarbi a week ago.  So far, so good.  No side effects and BP is perfect.",5,5,5
"Ithought Amlodipine was the worst pill I had ever taken for High blood pressure until I took Edarbiclor.  Amlodipine just made my legs swell up as big as an elephant's and my hair fall out, but Edarbiclor, which I thought was going to work well on lowering my blood pressure, made me have an irreglar, very fast heartbeat and my blood pressure rise to 225/110 and I spent the night in the hospital where they finally got my blood pressure down and my diastolic reading was down to 35. They put me on Valsartan and I did very well on it... till they recalled it and now I can't find anything that really keeps it down.  I am on Hydralzine, 3 of them three times a day. Still looking for something that works but have been messed up ever since taking Edarbyclor.",1,1,1
I've taken this for about 8 months and had bad side effects. Never again!,2,1,2
"Switched because hyzaar was having decreased effect. First week results were volatile. Be careful, as my bp fluctuated from 140/100 down to 70/60. Stabilized eventually. I later decreased to 40/12.5 as the diuretic was too strong and my bp was too often coming out low and I was dizzy when first standing. Even at the lower dose I sometimes am. Working on losing weight now to go back to Hyzaar as this stuff is more expensive ($100 for 3 months compared to $4 for 3 months of generic hyzaar). I also think in general I felt better when I was taking only hyzaar, so if I can lose weight I'd rather take it. ",4,3,4
"This medication has given me extreme stomach pain, weakness and body pain, Now they say after being off it for three days . Maybe gallbladder, strange! I didnâ??t have any problems before I started edarbylor 40/25 , doctor also said not due to medication, I find that strange I have not taken any of this crap since Monday, today being Thursday blood pressure 115 / 63 pulse 76 with no meds since Monday : BP great with no other meds. Appears it still is in my system . ",1,1,1
"I have very stubborn high blood pressure. I have tried Benicar, AZOR, lisinopril, losartan, valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide, Plus others. Blood pressure is 170/110 without meds. About 140/90 with above. With Edarbyclor and Bystolic it is 130/80. Finally under control! ",5,5,5
No side effects and excellent results.,5,5,5
"I was diagnosed with stage II hypertension since 1992. It was stubborn and just would not reduce despite having so many medications prescribed over the years I have lost count. My BP was average 186/118, with high creatinine level and poor GFR. I am 71 years, prognosis not good! I was prescribed Edarbyclor six months ago, my BP is now 135/90 with much improved creatinine and GFR readings. The only noticeable side effect for me has been slight constipation. which has been easy to deal with. Edarbyclor for me has been a magical fix for my hypertension. I can see fro many other comments on this post that it does not suit everyone. My experience with hypertension drugs over 25 years has been awful for side effects of so many prescribed drugs. I feel fortunate to have found a drug that significantly reduces my BP and improves kidney function, I was cynical about prescribed drugs for years and had almost given up with it all.",5,4,5
"This was administered in an emergency situation form a sample package in my doctor's office as my blood pressure was taken at 190/100 after 30 minutes my pressure steadily declined and leveled off at 140/80.  This was a miracle! I have a history of HBP, STROKES, DIABETES and M.S, allergies galore nothing has EVER controlled my HBP with the help of Metoprolol Tartrate",5,5,5
"I have stubborn high BP.  Doctor switched me from Valsartan & HTZ to Edarbyclor 40/25 mg.(He described this as similar modes of action and slightly stronger).  3 weeks later, BP has gone down a little.  So far so good.  Maybe some tiredness (not that I read all the other comments)...I'll see how that goes.",4,4,4
"Doc replaced Valsartan with this drug.  Took 1 pill in the morning along with other BP meds.  At 6pm I was incoherent, fainty, wobbly legs and my fingers were tingling.  I took no more!",1,1,1
Have been taking Toprol XL and not the generic for over 10 years. Take 100 mg in morning and 100 mg in evening. BP went up to 198/105 this past wed. and went to ER. Then was told to see my primary doc within 2 days. She put me on edarbyclor 40 mg cut in half and take in morning rather than my Toprol. Big mistake since I can't take diuretics. It kept me from peeing. Also had many other horrible side effects. Went back to my usual dose of Toprol XL and feeling better already. Calling doc tomorrow. Took this awful new drug for only two days.,1,1,1
I was taking up to 100mg of Metoprolol a day and it did NOTHING. Tried Lisinopril and Amlodapine; nothing but nasty side effects.  Started Edarbyclor and my BP came down withing days. You really need to give it two weeks. My BP before Edarbyclor peaked as high as 199/100. Now it's typically 125/80. I don't notice the side effects others mention.,5,5,5
"Always had low blood pressure. Got extremely sick, blood pressure was 244/166. Went to emergency room was giving a shot and pill and sent home. Family doctor seen the next day in stage three kidney failure. Was taking 5 different  a day eleven times. Brought it down, but was consuming my life. Was put on edarbyclor and bystolic pressure is now 106/64. Do have the muscle weakness bad. And heart doing that hard flop feeling.",5,2,5
"This medication is terrible. After two days, I felt muscle weakness, heart palpatations, extreme dizziness (the worst side affect). This morning my BP reading was very high,  225/95, and I just doubled up on my old medication to bring it down. I already feel 100% better than when I took the edarbyclor. I'm currently on Metoprol 25mg twice a day. Maybe all I need is to increase that dose. Seeing doctor tomorrow for another consultation and will return the free samples to him.",1,1,1
Side effects,4,1,4
"it brought my BP down but i have muscle weakness and tiredness.  i have muscle pain in my arms, mostly my left arm to where i cannot raise my arm up to comb my hair.  Basically i am losing use of my right arm.  Doctor says it can't be edarbyclor, but it happen right after taking edarbyclor, low dosage. But it is the only drug that lowered my BP.  what to do??",4,2,4
I hurt in my sides and stomach .. Tired  really out of breath could not hardly function .. Now doctor said I my have to have a liver transplant .. And this came on very sudden .. Don't know if the medication had any thing to do with it but it was very close togather,1,1,1
"Dr. gave me some free samples, which are not easy to open. It worked, but too well. My BP dropped very low on 3rd day of use. 2nd day of use I started having some leg cramps and clammy sweating after light activity. 3rd day, by evening, clammy sweating was much worse, dizzy, short of breath, chest pains and vomiting. BP dropped to 98/68. Took all night for chest pains to go away. Now I'm on day one of a new medication so we'll see how it goes.",3,1,3
I have a lot of joint pain or muscle pain and I think that is one of the side effects of taken this pill...,3,3,1
This pill brought down my blood pressure drasticly within a few days to 105 over 61.  Made a believer out of me.,5,5,5
"Been on numerous BP meds in the last six months. this one actually lowered BP-average 108/65, too much 88/46 at times. Constant light headedness, short of breath and back pain in left hip/lower abdomen. Can't work while on this medication. Very frustrated that I can't function on a normal basis every day and I've been off work since taking this drug. ",3,1,5
BP before was running 180/110 on the 3rd day I nearly died as a result of this medication. Was rushed to ER via EMS with NO BP and my heart rate had dropped to 30's. It's been a week and still remain dizzy with heart palpitations and heart damage. I am a 20 year Paramedic and WOULD NOT recommend this drug. It's too powerful and that's on the starting dose.,5,1,5
Lowered my BP fast and soon became too low. Constant feeling of fatigue and extreme muscle weakness even after cutting dose in half. ,5,1,4
"Lowered bp too much, 85/54 cut dosage by 1/2.  Still dips too low and waves of pure exhaustion.  Lie down or fall down feeling.",5,1,5

"My doctor changed my blood pressure medication to edarbyclor 40mg/25 mg. First day after taking it in am had severe headache, felt extremely weak, blood pressure borderline high. Second day, severe headache, extreme weakness, near syncope, blood pressure 198/110, heart rate 75, blood sugar is 276. Stopped taking this med after second day. called my doctor. went back to my regular medication. still weak, headaches, elevated blood sugar, borderline high blood pressure after third day. ",4,1,1
Decreased blood pressure & heart rate. Heart rate seems to be reduced too low. I am also on diabetes medication and not sure if these 2 things mix.,4,3,4
"First I developed cramps legs & hands then my toe got swollen,had an exray and determine it was caused by a tear so it is now wrapped and takes 7 mos. to repair. Noticed in side affects, toe is mentioned. I'm going off this medication.....",1,1,1
Fatigue feeling,2,2,4
After taking this med for 9 days it has lowered my BP too low and I always feel lightheaded/dizzy just doing the easiest task. I also have shortness of breath just walking 50 feet and rapid heart rate. I stopped this med today and will see my Dr. on Monday to change BP meds.,5,1,3
"been on edarbyclor one month. Fatigue, light headed, constant nausea. Has lowered my BP, but have high heart rate.",5,3,5
This drug is effective in lowering BP but the side effects are too much.  Have been on the drug for 5 months. Excessive tiredness and gas bloating and joint pain.  Will return to the Dr. next week to be taken of the drug.,4,2,4
Having diarrhea also blood pressure too low,3,3,3

I stay dizzy, sick to my stomach, very tired, short of breath, & ache all over. I don't feel like doing anything anymore which is not like me. I've called my Doctor and waiting to talk to him about this & see if we can try something different.",5,2,3
"I have a rare renal artery disease called fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries which results in hypertension which is resistant to treatment. After three renal angioplasties and a right renal stent, I was on 8 antihypertensive medications when I had a reaction to Lisinopril (angioedema of the lip/face). My physician ordered Edarbyclor 40 Mgm/12.5 and continued Clonodine 0.2 Mgm patches (2) weekly, Tekturna 300 Mgm Daily, Norvasc 10 Mgm Daily, Toprol Xl 100 Mgm BID and after 45 days, I have a stable BP. The side effects are some intestinal cramps,gas, fatigue but well worth it for me. I already have nephrosclerosis so can not afford to have an uncontrolled BP. At least my kidney function will remain stable instead of deteriorating. I praise Takeda for putting this drug on the market! It has given me a chance to live and enjoy the time that I have left.",5,5,5
Taking meds for one month. Helped B/P levels.Now I have upper back pain and shortness of breathe. High heart rate as well.,4,3,4
"On 2nd day of taking Edarbyclor 40/25mg. I experience a extremely painful cramp in upper thigh, dizziness, felt faint, fast heart beat, trouble breathing, cold sweat, very weak. BP was 100/46. Went to Dr. next day and was told just a leg cramp and BP went low because of trying to stand up, to stay on med. Got diarrhea, stomach cramps, dizziness, then on 5th day got bad pain in right side of chest and back, got so severe went across my chest. thought maybe I had a fractured rib, pain was so bad. Stopped taking Edarbyclor on Tuesday, by Wed. pain in chest better but then I woke up with a very bad cramp in the right uppper thigh. Meanwhile, my BP is all over the place because I monitor twice a day. As I read the literature, Dr. shouldn't have started me on higher dose, but at this point I will not take it again. It may lower your BP but the side effects are to many and definately interferred with my quality of life.",1,1,5
"Been on several BP meds with limited success.  Was on Edarby 80 and Bystolic 10, minimal success, but BP 164/90, flush in face, some confusion.  Switched to Edarbychlor, no side effects and BP is 115/74, lost weight and feel great.  I am in excellent shape for any age, weight lift, run, bike, swim 4-6 days a week, eat right, getting 8-10 hours sleep a night all part of the program.  All my family has BP issues, parents, cousins, aunts, all over 48 are experiencing same BP issues.  So far very pleased with drug.  Dropped from 254 to 227, hope to drop to 215 and maybe reduce dosage.  Doc showed me my history of visits and BP changes over 8 year period.  In 2004 at 215 no problems, 2008 at 230 BP OK but more other issues, all minor.  2010 hit 254 (bulking up and too much belly fat) 180/115, many sinus infections then surgery and BP never went down without meds.  Tried several and finally this seems to be working. No tiredness, weakness etc.  Ran 4 miles the weight trained for 1 hour this am, felt great all day.",5,5,5

"I have been on this medication for two weeks.  This medication has brought my blood pressure down I think two far.  I have had back pain and my heart has been skipping beats, also sometimes racing.  Very Very Dizzy.  It's like I can't stand up without falling at least once a day.  I am taking myself off this medication and trying something new.",5,1,5
This was my fourth BP med. After being on this one for two weeks had to call Dr. because BP was running 88/64 the highest was 114/80. Felt tired and dizzy most of the time.

Being overweight 290 and out of shape i needed something to lower my bp.  My blood pressure was lowered and I did feel faint.  I suspect that this is to be expected for a drug that lowers blood pressure.  No problems except that the cost at 109 per month is way too high.,5,5,5

"The first 2 weeks on this med all seemed okay. But then all the negatives started to appear. Specifically dizziness, aching body areas and feeling totally fatigued at times. Never had experienced any of these problems prior to taking this medication. I am a very active 73 year old. It has lowered my blood pressure but has increased my heart rate a fact I know because I monitor my pressure.",2,1,5
"Although the med brought my BP down very quickly, after just a few days on the med, I started having severe upper back pain after doing simple everyday chores.  It became so bad that I didn't want to do anything but rest.  Over the last several days, I have begun having muscle spasams at night in up upper thigh and continual leg cramps which began in the thighs and moved also into the calves of both legs.  I have been on the meds for two weeks, but discontinued using it today.  ",3,1,3

I took this medication for 7 days and started having bad upper back pain whenever I did any kind of work. At 14 days the pain was severe and nearly constant. I also started feeling light headed every time I got out of a chair. I stopped the medication and symtoms went away in 5 days. I stayed off the medication for 10 days and restarted. In five days the back pain, light headedness were back as bad as before. On the second round I was becoming very irritable over very minor things. As I said earlier the medication did wonders for my blood pressure but completely ruined my quallity of life.",5,1,5

I have a 4 yr old son who has been taking this for the last 2 yrs and it has done an amazing job on controlling his High Bp. It has helped greatly reduce the stress he had on his kidneys and heart due to the High Bp. He still has a bicuspidal aortic valve but the enalapril has shown no effect on it.,5,5,5
"After taking Enalapril 20 mg once a day for about three years after being switched from another Ace inhibior, due to the dry non-productive cough, my doctor increased my doage to one 20 mg. twice a day.  About two to three months later I began to experience  terrible flatulence, but worse of all I had a change in my bowels and consequently changed my diet to include more fiber without over doing it.  The situation got  increasingly worse and I was not getting any help from my primary care physician who suggested with scare tactics that I needed to eliminated the possibility of cancer, which OF COURSE I did almost immediately. On two separate occasions-one before the  colonoscopy and one post, I stopped taking the Enalapril, then the anti-inflammatory (prescribed after the colonoscopy).  On both occasions there was a marked difference.  The second time I remained off Enalapril and all the mucosa and fecal incontinence disappeared until I started another medication in the ARB category.  Needless to say I did not take it for too long; maybe six weeks before my bowels began to go for five to six days with no movement. Prior to the original malfunction mani- festation, my bowels would always move  thoroughly at least every other day, and sometimes two to three times a day.  I would NEVER go five days without a movement.  Now, as a I am writing about it in hope of helping another poor soul, I see why so many adult diapers are on the market.  Dr. William Prather wrote the article on a study of Enalapril at Harvard Medical School that gave me the courage to quit the blood pressure medication, but my blood pressure is far, far from normal EVERY DAY. And I have to say that I feel  better that I can eliminate normally, but I know my blood pressure needs down from 170/90.  Is there any hope for me knowing  that I can not tolerate Ace Inhibitors or ARB's.  Please Help Me (before I suffer too much damage)  BJW  ",5,1,2

"What started as atypical high blood pressure has revealed itself to be hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone) which causes hypokalemia (low potassium) which causes hypertension (high blood pressure). After a few years of doctors trying different combinations of blood pressure meds, an endocrinologist diagnosed the hyperaldosteronism. I initially began taking Spironolactone to treat but after a few weeks I began experiencing breast pain and noting breast enlargement (Gynocomastia). My doctor switched me to Eplerenone which is supposed to equally effective, but without that particular side effect. The breast issue went away and my potassium levels have stabilized into a normal range. My BP continues to be marginally high at times, but I think other factors will need to be improved (like my weight) to get over the hump. Overall, I am pleased to date, but another users previous review about kidney disease after 5 years of this medication have me greatly concerned. The endocrinologist says the need to regulate my aldosterone with medication will be for the rest of my life, so I will be raising the subject of long term risks.",4,3,3
"Primary hyperaldosteronism. Prescribed by a nephrologist,  seemingly perfect drug for this condition.  BP improved significantly but after 5 years taking it,  I am in  stage 4 kidney disease,  which is irreversible. Be wary. Nephrologist happily will push you into dialysis and end your life as you know it. Be watchful for this dreadful side effect,  educate yourself about CKD and consider your options.",5,2,3

I have been taking Spironolactone for several years but I began noting breast enlargement (Gynocomastia).  My doctor put me Eplerenone which is supposed to be a more effective drug for the type of hypertension that I have.  The literature says it may take up to 4 weeks for the full effects of the drug to start working.  I closing out my 3rd week on Eplerenone and my BP is still not stable.  In fact I had to go to the ER several weeks ago after experiencing a very high reading  I've got my fingers crossed that it will eventually fully kick-in.,3,1,2
"I took this to help regulate my potassium only.  It may have worked, but not without lots of problems and I had to go off of it after two months.

"Horrible medication. Did not work. Do not think this should ever be rx'ed as a long term treatment. I had been taking this as part of a combo pill with lisinopril (lisinopril 20 mg-hctz 12.5mg) for >4 years for my essential hypertension. It took me that long to figure out what was the culprit of all of my side effects: ringing in ears/slight hearing loss, dry mouth, get up to urinate 5x a night, increased hunger...never felt full, increased thirst, fatigue, increased weight gain (from 123lbs to 132lbs, I'm 5""7 and 30 yrs old) that I could not drop for the life of me with intense exercise 6-7 days/week and eating healthy/counting calories. Have been off of it for only 3 1/2 weeks, all of my side effects have started to subside, I actually feel full after eating/have decreased appetite, down -5 lbs, and my BP is controlled with lisinopril alone. Drs. RX these meds like it is candy without fully informing patients about all the negatives. Through my own research I have found HCTZ has been criticized for being overprescribed as there are no studies that show it actually helps prevent stroke/heart attack ",1,1,1
"After taking Effexor/venlafaxine for over 10 years for my anxiety and depression, the medication made me go from borderline low blood pressure my entire life to extremely high blood pressure consistently for five months. At first, we, my doctor and I figured it was anxiety related but I started monitoring at home as well. He was reluctant to go right into bp meds so started with the hydro first, right away I was back to great numbers. I'm not sure how a water pill can cause so many side effects as being reported in the reviews, some allergic reactions I of course get. I just made sure to intake appropriate fluids, not coffee and or soda all day, lots of water and juices. I of course used the bathroom more often and also made the clearly stated necessary adjusts to my diet as well to accommodate the vitamin K and potassium. So I personally did not experience much of any issues, a couple leg cramps while sleeping, when my potassium intake went low. But for the most part this did great and added bonus, I take thyroid meds that make my ankles swell and it took care of that issue as well. I feel bad that there are doctors out there who are not thorough and do not do their dodillagence, however I'm quite lucky my doctor enjoys to learn, research and educate. Me having an anxiety disorder I'm on top of my health care and make sure to ask for what I need. ",5,5,5
"Since starting this med (12.5mg) along with Amlodipine, my BP has lowered. However, I am experiencing cramping in my leg muscles, dry mouth and occasional headache. I have only been taking it for 2 weeks. So, I am giving it some time. ",4,2,2
"I was taking this med for about 4 years. At first I started having anxiety attacks. Still have them now but not as bad. For the last couple of years I've had tingling in my arms, feet ",1,1,1

My feet and hands hurts horrible. For some reason my right elbow hurts really bad and I can barely bend it. My eyes are red all the time and my eye sight has gotten worse. Doctor never said anything about taking extra potassium. Have a constant headache.  I stopped taking it and hope that the symptoms will go away. I had none of these symptoms before taking this drug. Also, I am allergic to penicillin and you are not supposed to take this if you are allergic. So my doctor needless to say did not do his job of filling me in on the side effects and reactions to this medication. Not a good drug. My mother was also on it and she was a mess until we took her off of it and now she is back to normal. It makes you fell like a zombie!",5,2,5

I was taken off of it along with spironolactone and started on amlodipine due to the gout flare up.  Not as effective but I'm giving it time.  I started with a rhuemotologist due to the gout and he immediately said that the hydrochlorothiazide was the root cause of the gout.  I now have to add allopurinol and colcrys to my medications to combat the gout.  I'm not happy at all that I wasn't told about this side effect.  The nephrologist who prescribed it for my bp didn't even want to take me off this drug when I got my first few flare ups.  My internist was the one who did.",5,1,5
" Started on 25 MG, not working bump 50 MG, still not working then added Benazepril.  Bp ok at home not great when at docs.  Started having blood glucose issues, restlessness,  tremors, and tachycardia. Doc refuses to take me off that med even though I show her evidence for all these symptoms . I'm also allergic to penicillin. Probably should not even be on this drug. So I made decision to go off it on my own everything but trimmers is gone. Explain that. Sometimes I hate doctors. ",1,1,1
"I started this drug at 25mg. First day is ok, but my bp still a little over 140/80. On the second day, my bp came down to about 120/80, but I started to have severe vertigo, extreme hot flashes, shortness of breath, fatigue and irregular heart beat. I cut the dosage to half, vertigo became dizziness, but the rest of the symptoms were still there. Called my doctor and got switched to lisinopril. Hope this drug is better.",3,1,5
The Dr. added this drug to the Losartan I am taking. Seems to be bringing my bp numbers down a bit more.,5,4,4

I have a big fight with my PCP coming up! I am allergic to penisilin (I don't know how to spell it You get the jist) and wondering why my face would swell and I would get shortness of breath suddenly and cramping toes, feet and hands!! Thank you so much for bringing this information to light. Now I have ammunition to fight with! Praise God, praise you all for your courage to speak out! I am not a test dummy or lab rat to be practiced on! I don't mind sharing a diagnosis with a student but these FDA approved sanctions...Got to go! YOU TRY THEM!! Thanks again. MET.",3,1,3
"Started taking this BP pill with another BP pill. First day of taking it made me flush, gave me a headache and raised my blood pressure. Second day I took this BP pill three hours later put me in the ER with TACHYCARDIA.I was so scared of stroking out or going into cardic arrest.It was 12.5 mg.",1,1,1
I took this drug in the past without incident. Multiple years later I was prescribed this drug within 20 minutes I became very ill. I was treated in ER. I had heart kidney and lung damage. At that time doctors did not think this drug caused this. I had High lactic acid level ekg showed MI. I was told I had sepsis. After recovering I again took this drug. The same thing happened. Both times I was in ICU and very ill. I was told this was an anaphylactic reaction. Docs had never seen this before. There is no documentation of this type of reaction. I take different meds now for my hypertension,1,1,1
"I was on it approximately 8 years.  I began having bloating, stomach pain and diarrhea.  I had several GI tests which were all negative.  I kept researching this drug and found out I shouldn't have been taking it because I am allergic to penicillin.  I kept going to my PCP and finally I asked him to take me off it.  He didn't want to but I insisted.  All my symptoms began going away within 24 hours.  I am really disappointed in my doctor and have suffered immensely from this drug.",4,1,4
Began Hydrochlorothiazide with Verapamil for BP treatment at age 39. Then Lisinopril was added at age 43 for my treatment. I have been very satisfied with the results and correction of my BP over the years with very minimal side effects. The only major side effect I have had is occasional light headedness when standing to quickly. Regular lab work has always been within range. Thank You!,5,5,5
Started with lisinopril and HCTZ separately. Developed heat flash/redness. Switched to combo pill. Lately BP risen. Told to double intake. Started to cramp. Told to increase K. Not sure if I want to take 25mg again. Will try more OJ first for K supplement.,4,4,4
"Was first put on 12.5 mg and a month later increased me to 25 mg which made my bp shoot up high, 165/118, along with a lot of muscle spasms, sweating, leg and feet cramps, tension headache from lower temple, across face, bridge of nose to the other lower temple, joint pain, extreme dry mouth and bad constipation. Ended up in the ER with bp of 165/118 and small amounts of blood came out of my nose. Enough to scare the crap out of me. This is my 4th hbp medicine and have been allergic to all 4 - every bp family of medicines. Am going to find an alternative medicine route to try.",1,1,1
"Drug is making me extremely weak and tired,been having some stomach cramps and slight vision issues,doctor wants me to keep taking it,but i'm going to take a holistic approach,just makes me pee a lot and my potassium is dropping to dangerous levels.

"I was on this for 6 months I started at 25mg and went up to 75mg thinking that my blood pressure would come down, it did but my potassium went down as well as my magnesium and sodium and I went from being healthy to chest pains and a cough I cant get rid of and my kidneys went all out of wack, with the medication which now  I am on nothing right now but potassium pills and still have this damn cough that wont go away, doctor is still monitoring me but I think that with all the side effects it just wrecked my lungs.

"Have been taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg for about five years.  I always take my Blood pressure to ensure myself that the medication is definitely required. The fluctuations in my blood pressure has presented grave concern for me, as well as my physician. I usually need the medication about three days out of a week. On a Monday, for instance, often have a BP of 102 over 77.  I do not take the Diuretic for obvious reasons.  The other medication prescribed is Furosemide 25mg, twice daily. One of my prime difficulties are severe swelling of my legs which radiates to the ankles and feet. When this occurs my BP is always high (140/90 to 170/92. Within an hour of taking the medication my BP is within normal limits. I take a Potassium supplement, 20meq, one tablet each day that I take the diuretics.  Over a period of weeks I have developed three Urinary Tract Infections, treated with antibiotic each time controlled and  cured the difficulty. A Urinalysis was performed at the Dr.'s office revealing Hematuria. Had a kidney/ Bladder Ultrasound about three weeks ago.  Have not received my results as yet.  The concern I have is whether the Diuretics prescribed several years ago could have caused some damage to the Kidneys or Bladder. However, Hypertension if left untreated could be the causative factor.  ",5,4,5

it's a diuretic and dr didn't prescribe potassium--almost had coronary--on potassium now but can't get it regulated.  have no side effects other than this.  seeing if other bp meds can work without side effects but browsing internet shows none.  maybe answer is doubled potassium on daily basis with blood test every month.,5,2,5

I have been recovering my mental health, but my blood pressure is up to 175/95 and my feet, legs and fingers are swelling. No solution to these problems offered yet.",5,2,3

To counteract the depletion of necessary nutrients when taking this drug I  take a 90mg Potassium and 400mg Magnesium supplements and try to eat potassium loaded bananas. I've had NO side effects, only did when dose was increased to 25MG and went back to 12.4MG. I'm grateful to say it's the only prescription drug I take.

No one ever mention I might be having side effects from HCTC. The comments I have read fit my symptoms. Except the numbness in my face and burning tounge. My cardiologist just told me to quit taking HCTZ but did not say why. Now I know. Wonder if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?",4,1,2
Since I have been on this medication I  am very dizzy blurred vision headaches and feet numbness and tingling. Been taking it for aboutfour months. Notice symptoms last couple of weeks.

Sometimes I could walk further and sometimes less. I went to Dr. , here I had very low potassium. He took the test that day and rushed it. Later that day he called me said he was calling in for 4 pills for me to take right away. I got them , he checked my potassium five days later with another blood test and said it was fine. I found out when a person is taking Dieredtic pills they need potassium subsatute. Well I was never perscribed one. I am not a doctor, u would think he would of perscribed one for me. He told me I can take the pills over the counter. must not of worked, cause now I can't walk. I am quitting the pillls today. I urinated all the time. Drinking Gatoraid2 and taking potassium pills over the counter. See if that works. Until I get back in to Dr. What a nightmare. How am I supose to take care of myself like this.

The nurse said to go to the pharmacy immediately and get a prescription for Klorcon (potassium) and to stop the hydrochlorothiazide and to limit my fluid intake to 4 8oz cups a day including pudding, milk, juice,jello, gravy, etc. She said my potassium and my sodium was dangerously low! It took a few months to return to normal. Now my BP is high again.  While taking hydrochlorothiazide, my ankles swelled and I had a large amount of hair loss.

Ran out of the Lisinpril only and took the combination for two days until I could get back to the pharmacy.  Big mistake!  I was again crampy and sore all over.  Took me a week to feel better.

Even had my thyroid tested to see if that was the cause and it came back normal, so yeah this proves the pill is the main cause....

She then tried to convince me that I was sleeping so much due to depression.  She was in CYA mode because you should have your kidney funstions checked routinely while on this med and she never sent me for any tests.  She did finally admit that blood work I had done right before I started taking this showed my kidneys were functioning normally.  I had to change doctors to get a refferal to ka idney specialist.

I drank a fair amount of beer back then and apparently the combination of this drug and drinking beer can cause your uric acid level to skyrocket which in turn causes Gout.  After discovering this, the doctor took me off of this drug and I stopped drinking beer completely.  It took about a month before I cold walk again without pain and after about four months my uric acid level was down to about five.  If you are on this drug, be sure that the doctor checks your uric acid level when taking blood tests especially if you drink beer).  If it is high, then get off this drug.

My Dr. also put me on Klor-con M20, which is potassium. I noticed people having leg cramps and other side effects. This water pill depletes your potassium, therefore you should take a potassiam supplement to prevent cramps. The water pill has made me gain weight instead of losing weight. Not happy about this, may stop taking this med. I don't have any swelling of feet or excess fluid and never did. Dr. just added this because my BP would go up as high as 180/110, took BP yesterday and it was 160/80. Have been taking this med for a couple of months. Don't understand the weight gain,go figure.

No quality of life, no desire for anything or to do anything.  Need my life back, going to stop these pills today. New dr appt on Oct 1 at Southwestern Med Ctr in Dallas.

Thought something might be growing inside me, but apparently not. DID I SAY I WAS DEPRESSED? Taking Zoloft, not doing any good. Up until I started taking this med, I felt okay.  Now it's how bad will I feel today?  Feel like a hypochondriac.  Don't socialize with anyone anymore, have cut all friends and family off.  Hope help is on the way.",2,1,2

The dr looked at me funny when I told him all the side effects I had with it. The dr's tell you that these things can't happen with certain drugs, but they do.

I have suffered with chronic headaches and joint pain since I was a teenager. During my weightloss, I noticed that my joint pain and headaches would go away within 30 mins. of taking the med. I visited my PCP and told him about this and he said that if this was working for me, there were little to no side effects and that he thought it would be fine to continue taking this drug to treat the symptoms. I am guessing that I am developing a more serious case of artheritis and that this drug is reducing the fluid retention on my joints and neck. It works and I like that.",5,5,5

While I see this drug works for some people it scares me for those that will be effected as I have been. I have been off of it for a week now and am slowly feeling normal again.  I will never take this again and my doctor told me it was ""stress"" causing the reactions but since stopping this med, I am begining to feel like me again and I was getting scared I never would again.  I am going to eat better.. exercise more and stay away from pills because while some DO save lives.. I truly felt this one was going to kill me.  Light headed.. swimming head.. dizzy.. uncoordinated.. tightness in chest.. my chest hurt and fluttered.  I was not feeling bad before being put on this med. My bp was 130ish to 140ish over 84-88.  When I told my doctor what was happening.. he found my potassium too low.. gave me one week supplement.. felt little better and he added lisinopril and once supplements ended (could be no significance) .. the symptoms started right back up with my bp being 102/64 .. I have never been this low! Shortness of breath again.. you name it! I have quit them both and am seeking a new doctor. If your doctor does not listen to you .. switch.

I am embarrassed and no longer do any of the things I enjoy because this weight gain has affected me in more ways that anyone can imagine.

"I started on 12.5 mg and it didn't do much. Was already on Diovan20, lisinopril 10, coreg 40. Went to 25 mg and bp went down to 110\65. After a week on .25, I thought I was having a stroke. Numb hands at night. Tingling in toes and fingers. Cold toes and hands. Went to Dr. she cut back to 12.5. Still bad. I quit for a couple days and improved. Back on, tingling back. I quit it today. I can't take it. Got severe sunburn on motorcycle ride, wife didn't get any sunburn.It lowered my bp, but it's not worth it to me. ",5,1,5
I started taking HCTZ 25mg since 01/2007 and it has been very good for me. I had some rashes late 2007 and blamed it on my aftershave. Its cleared now. My Dermatologist agreed with me. Used Fluocinonide gel 0.5 to clear the rashes. My libido is not as it used to be. That`s all I can say on the side effect. I am satisfied with it. I bought me Resperate  and I do excercise a lot. Feel much better.,3,4,4
"Since college (30 years ago) my BP would go high (190/110) but I could always make it go down (130/80) by relaxing and deep breathing. About a month ago it started going up and would not come down. I was at the dentist and he refused to work on my tooth until the BP was down. I became worried and went to the DR. My DR. started me on enalapril 50mg/day for 2 weeks. This stabilized my BP at 145/93. My Dr. was not satisfied with the result and started me on HCZ 25mg along with the enalapril. The very first day was spent in bed asleep. I thought it was some kind of sedative. After several days of fighting the tiredness I came back alive. After a month of HCZ I still feel like I just ran the Boston marathon all the time. Periodically I will get a wasted day where I have to nap the day away. I don't experience most of the side affects listed by other reviewers, I'm stable on my feet, think clearly, no swelling or rashes, and have good mental energy. I've not had a problem with urination or constipation. I take the HCZ dose in the AM and by afternoon my stomach feels a bit queasy so I eat to settle it. This routine has developed into eating all the time in order to keep my stomach from being empty. Needless to say I'm gaining weight. I also experience an odd feeling of being slightly high from time to time...maybe this is the lightheadedness described by others. I've noticed if I sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes without talking, writing, or driving I will doze off. There's been some embarrasing moments over this affect. Oddly enough I have experience trouble sleeping at night. The last and worst side affect from the HCZ is loss of libido. My BP is now consistently at  110-120/78-82, but my pulse is always over 100, something I never had a problem with before HCZ. For now I will learn to tolerate the HCZ side affects as dialysis, aneurisms, and stroke is something I wish to totally avoid.",5,3,5

I'd rather have had the loss of appetite and weight loss that everyone else seems to have. Wouldn't it be nice if our doctors warned us about these things first, instead of making us figure it out for ourselves 6 months later? I'm going to stop taking this pill.

Not to consume alcohol. To drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. I know from experience with other health issues as well as treating those in chronic pain.

Urine output has increased but not to a point of being bothersome.  Shortness of breath is of concern.

They did a cat scan and a mir which showed nothing.  Its almost two months since this started and I still have no clue.  I was reading the side effects on hysrochlorothiazide 25mg and it said dizziness could be a side effect........",5,5,5
I started this Hydrochlorothiazide in April 08. It worked fine until the hot weather started. I then noticed this itchy blotchy rash on any sun exposed areas. I proceeded to a skin doctor and she didn't really no what it was so she took a biopsie. We also decided to stop the Hydrocholorothiazide the rash got alot better. I'll try to get to the point that is I drink alot of beer so maybe the side effects are lingering after 2 weeks. No rash but stinging tingling on face arms and legs After 2 weeks could it be the alcohol continuing the side effects. I would think the drug would be out of my body by now. THANK YOU.,2,1,3

I am very satisfied with this medication, in fact Im very happy. Both Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide together make a very good team for me. (I am a Black Female) I do not get any headaches anymore, in fact I cannot recognize any side effects since I started using this, other then having to urinate many times during the day. And having problems with bowel movements, also my potassium levels are very low, as Im told this medication depletes potassium levels.

The first day I tried going w/o it, it improved, and by the second day it was gone.  My blood pressure has not yet increased, however I still take Lisinoprel.  I have not noticed my hands swelling or other fluid retention since not taking this med.  I wonder how much good I was really gaining from it while I did use it for all that time.  I was surprised that side effects would start after all this time.  Perhaps I built up an intolerance to it over time.",2,2,3
Should u take potassium with this med,5,5,5
It works in combination with other drugs,5,5,3

Works very well,5,5,5
"I was placed on HCTZ, 25mg, for the diuretic effect (as an alternative to Lasix), my BP is typically only 110/70. Because of that I have had issues associated with low BP, dizzy, postural hypotension. I haven't so much noticed the diuretic effect, as it's more of a controlled release than Lasix which hits you here, now, and hard. Overall I think I will continue to take the medication, with any medication you have to give it some time and often the side effects with disappear or become more managable. ",5,3,3
I am still learning about this medication so to comment on its usage and effectiveness would be premature. However for the limited time of its usage it has been very effective.,4,3,3

I noticed it helped but overall did not see significant change as the problem actually was with my low blood pressure. Last June I noticed a skin rush but thought maybe it was something I ate. August 18th I was taken to ICU as I woke up with my lips, tongue, and jaw swollen and small rushes all over my body. Still, I did not connect it with Approvel as I have been taking it for a while. I was given cortisone with antihistamines and returned home. On and off body rushes every 2-3 days and on 26th Sept I told my doctor so he said to stop the BP medication as it could be a pill side effect. Today, 29 Sep 2017 I woke up at 5.30 in the morning with the exact the same reaction (swollen lips, tongue, rush). Was taken again to ICU and repeated the whole process. This time my blood pressure that was 14.3 over 11.5. Needless to say, I was really scared so as I did not take any other medication just the BP ones. Long story short! I don't think I will be taking this BP drug again.Thanks for the patience in reading this.",3,1,3

"I've been on Losartan for about a year.  During that time, I have gained 15 pounds.  I always feel hungry, and I sweat profusely.  When I first started taking Losartan, my BP was stabilized, but in recent months it has become very erratic.  It's that this medication is not working and has unfavorable side effects. I don't want to take it any longer and will see my physician next week to find a more acceptable alternative. ",1,1,1
"I was on this medication for about a week.  I started getting symptoms including numbness and tingling in the left side of my mouth/lips, left index finger, and big toe.  Scared me!  I thought I was having a stroke!  Then my mouth became so dry I couldn't stand it.  Was switched to Lisinopril and my side effects from Losartan disappeared.",4,1,4
"Dr prescribed this for my HBP. 100/12.5 dosage once a day. Makes me feel tired and I have had leg aches and cramping. Heart palpitations and fluttering, loss of sleep, and bags under my eyes I never had before. This one isn't good for me I can tell. ",3,3,3

On the third day my leg muscles started to feel tired 2 miles into the run, bp at 80/50 that night. Things started to improve little by little since then but not back to where I was before taking the med. bp also creeping up too, currently at 110/78.  I worried my bp will be back to where I started once the body adjusts to the med.  Side affects: frequent urine, dizzy if stand up quickly.",4,3,4

"Although this drug immediately lowered my blood pressure, the muscle weakness in my legs were awful! I am an avid runner on the tread meal exercising for at least 60 minutes per day. I could hardly walk for over 10 minutes I had such leg weakness. I also felt like I had the starting of a cold all the time. After 3 weeks It just kept getting worse so I took myself off of it.

"After trying for three years to find a BP medicine that worked, my doctor put me on Losartan/Hctz 100/25 and then added Hydralazine 25. It seemed to do the trick.  Now on this for four years and can barely walk.  My feet have been checked for nerve damage, but there is none.  I am blaming this condition on the Losartan and hope that I can find another BP drug that will keep my pressure within reason.  Other side effects have been mucous in the nose, tiredness, lack of energy, itching and hives, runny eyes, muscle cramps  and I could go on for another page.  ",5,1,3
I'm taking 50mg of the losartan/hcg along with amlodipine 5mg.  Before this my blood pressure would be from 140/98 - 170/100.  These have brought it down to an average of 125/86.  No side effects as far as I can teell.,5,5,5

BP is down to 121/77- pulse 64,5,5,5
"I was prescribed Losartan HCTZ50-12.5mg per day when I had my yearly physical in September, 2013. I will say this: it lowered my BP from about 140/80 down to 106/60, but it was at the expense of having weakness in my legs, dry mouth, and the most important thing, I believe it caused me to have trigeminal neuralgia. Losartan opens up the blood vessels/veins to help reduce the blood pressure, but I think the dilation of the blood vessels in my brain caused it to rub the trigeminal nerve and triggered a painful attack. I have been weaning myself off this stuff, taking gabapentin(300mg X 3 a day). I want to get this drug out of my system as soon as possible! It's not for me. I will talk to the Dr. about something else at my next visit. Good luck!",5,1,1

Feeling more energy and clear headed since switching from atenenols combo which I was on for a few years. Previously tried lisinopril and amolidipine. Heart rate improved from 54 to 64 which is probably why I was so incredibly tired all the time.,5,4,4
"I was on this for only 2 weeks. I am an avid runner, but on this medicine, I was barely able to walk without pain/cramps/spasms in my legs, and muscle cramps at night.  Also a constant nasal drip. Not recommended for an active person.",1,1,1
"Had to switch from Benicar, due to insurance. Had severe leg cramps and .peripheral neuropathy in both feet. Did not know this medication caused this. But after going through blood tests and MRI, along with nerve tests. My neurologist shrugged his shoulders and said ""he didn't know."" I did some research on the internet and found some posts that said Losartan had caused Peripheral neuropathy in others and asked my doctor to switch, within days my feet were getting better.

"I have been taking this drug for about 3 years,and it has lowered my blood pressure greatly, 120/70. I was deadly  high. It worked immediately. I am a little more tired,a little less hair,and I had to get a new eye prescription. These are minor things to me. I exercise daily,and feel great. If you exercise daily,you too will feel better. It does not seem to interfere with the SEX pills either. (smile) Remember,The mind controls the body,the body does not control the mind.A 64 year old. old.",5,4,5
"I had a TIA and was put on losartan. Medicine caused extremely painful cramps to the point where I was cramping multiple times a day, sometimes even when I was driving. Stopped taking it when cramps started affecting my sleep.",5,1,2

Off now using clonidine and hctz.2 Blood pressure stabilizing swelling gone except for feet sometimes. Trying to get weight off by exercise and diet,haven't lost a darn pound. Starting to feel better, still some bad days. ",5,1,1
"I have been taking this drug for blood pressure for a month.  Although it controlled my BP I had extreme fatigue on this med.  I felt ""foggy"" out of focus and could barely make it through my work days.  I have exercised 3-5 times a week for 11 years and I could barely get off the couch while taking this.  It wasn't a good match for my energy level and I can't stand feeling that out of it and tired. ",5,2,4
"I started med. about 2 years ago and it seemed to work. but in the past 4 months I have dealt with some many side effects that I just want to scream and I want people to know. It caused painful urination,swollen joint, fatigue, rash and itching, nasal conjstn, blurry vision,dry mouth,back pain,and bowel troubles. It has been awful and it has caused me to be so depressed with all the things going on. Plus sleep lose and worry.  If this is prescribed for you pay attention to your body and quit if you start feeling bad.  It only gets worse the longer you take it!!",1,1,1
Mild Hypertension.  Works well for me.,5,5,5
I took this drug and it caused severe hypoglycemia.  Was taken to hospital.,4,1,1
"My doctor had to switch my blood pressure medication 3 times before I found a medication that worked well for me. Losartan is what I'm taking now.  I have been on it for 3 months now.  I liked Losartan because I hadn't noticed any side effects until recently. Maybe it's just me but this is what I'm experiencing now.  The Losartan pills I used to get from CVS were round and white. I took those for 2 months and they worked great.  Last time I went to get my prescription of Losartan though the pills were oblong and yellow. I tried to look the pills up online and I found some pictures of Losartan but no pictures of what I’m taking now (imprinted with APO on one side and 10012.5 on the other).  I noticed with the yellow Losartan ills I get some stomach discomfort if I take them first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.  The other pills (white) never bothered me.  I also noticed some swelling in my ankles toward the end of the day which I never had before.  I wondered if maybe the coating in this pill (yellow) was different or something else that my body doesn't like.  Then again, I'm not a doctor and realize this could just be my body.  Overall, this medication has worked better for me than my past two medications - Atenolol and Amlodipine Besylate.  Atenolol controlled my blood pressure but made my ears ring real bad.  The Amlodipine did not work for me at all. ",4,4,4
Due to someones error I was taking 200mg of this med. In an out of the hospital since a year ago. They finally raised a red flag my last hospital stay to the losartan over dose. Can anyone tell me if they to have had an overdose issue with this med ? It states right on my script bottle to take one pill by mouth twice a day ! I can't seem to get to feeling better. Will it stop the constant sick feeling !,1,1,1
"I hate this medicine. I have had so many side effects. Gout,cough,sinusitis,knee pain and joint pain. It hasn't helped my blood pressure either. It has made my tacky- cardia worse. And has possibly caused problems with my stationary tubes and more ringing and noises in my ears. I have lost some hearing too. They should band this drug.I never had problems with my stationary tubes before not until I was put on this drug.",1,1,1
rash on arms,2,3,2
I have been taking this medication for 2 years and is the first medication to actually keep my blood pressure under control.  I do experience some coughing but definately feel 100% better overall since taking this medication.,5,5,5
I can stop coughing with this medication.  A thick mucus in my throat.  It travels to my stomach and gives me an upset stomach.  Don't take this medication unless you want endless coughing!,4,1,3
"I am taking this to lower blood pressure.  It has done that.  The biggest complaint is going to the bathroom all of the time, especially at night.  I wake up every two to three hours and have to go.  I have dry mouth so i keep a water bottle by my bed at all times.  The constant getting up at night keeps me from getting a good night rest which makes me tired all day.",3,2,3

"A nightmare drug! Losartan gave me severe chronic bronchitis. I thought I had developed late-onset asthma, and was suddenly, horribly tied to a preventive inhaler, an emergency inhaler (albuterol) and a nebulizer. I thought the breathing problems were associated with a recent thyroid operation, but when I found the 8% side effect of upper respiratory infections due to Losartan, I stopped taking the drug and breathing difficulties improved quickly and dramatically! No more inhalers! Occasional throat clearing only. Beware of this drug!",1,1,1
"I've been on this drug for 7 months and Finally found out why I feel so horrible. Back pain, breathlessness, itchy eyes, dehydrated, blurry vision, anxiety, depression, gained weight, tired all the time but can't sleep, nausea, severe cramping in legs & hips.

"I was switched from Lipitor for obvious reason more than one year ago.  I have found my blood pressure more controlable on Losartan than on Lipitor.  It is very easy to take with or without food, and remember, it may cause urination about 4 hours after takin, so please take it during the day or morning so you won't have to interrupt your sleep.

I started this drug approx. 2 years ago. 1 year ago the Dr reommended I use a niacin also. 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. After doing some research I found that both of these can make you hyperglycemic. Great! I have stopped the niacin but with little insurance I will stay with Losartan/HCTZ because it does keep the b.p. within range and I have not experienced any side effects.,5,4,4

I thought I was having a MI but all cardiac workup results were negative.  I got off the HCTZ & within 4 days I felt like a new person.

BP was 194/100 and climbing. Lisinopril made me cough all the time & my eyes water; I felt awful. Switched to Losartan-HDC & my BP dropped to 125/71 & remains in that range. I have some dry mouth/dry nasal issues & just drink more water. Pleased with the results.,5,5,5
"I've been on Hyzaar for many years without problem and with very minimal side effects, if any at all. It has kept my extremely high blood pressure within the normal range, which is exactly what its supposed to do. Since my prescription recently expired my M.D. prescribed Losar which I was unfamiliar with...until I came here and found out its the same as Hyzaar. I do however occasionally take an additional medication as a diuretic (Lasix) because the Hyzaar doesn't seem to do the trick for me in that department anymore. Overall though I am very pleased with Hyzaar/Losar (but don't even get me started on that darn Lasix!)",5,5,5
terrible cough,5,1,5

I had the bad cough one, the headache one, the constipation one, etc.  If Doctors really knew the side affect they would not prescribe some of the drugs.  Been on this one about a month and what an improvement.  So side affect that I am aware of.  After about a week the medicine dropped my blood pressure down into the 'good numbers'.  My only problem is staying hydrated.  I guess it is the HCTZ but my system wants more fluids that I normally drink.  I consider this a good problem as I probably need to drink more fluids anyhow.  Good medicine for me and I would recommend you to try if the others are not bring down your pressure where you would like to see it.",5,5,5
"I have only been taking this medicine for the last two months.  I started taking lisinopril/hctz and felt extreamly tired all the time.  With the new meds I feel like 100 bucks again.  No fatigue, i did however have some feet pain in the begining but it has since subsided.  ",4,5,4

controlled blood pressure,4,4,4
"I have recently been formally diagnosed w/ HBP even though I've been borderline for about six years. All the other meds that have been prescribed have made me feel worst than how I feel when my BP goes up, to the point where I can't proceed with my daily activities, like providing for my three kids. After a week of taking this medication, my BP has normalized. I even went a day without taking it to test its effectiveness and my BP stayed normal. Additionally, I haven't had any side effects. I am very pleased with this medication.",5,5,5
"Have been on drug several years and have constant cough. Havent seen in side effects this drug causes coughs, but am allergic to sulfa drugs. Wondering is this why cough wont go away??? Doctors dont always listen",5,3,3
Terrible metal taste in my mouth and terrible metal smell through my nasal cavity. Just awful.,4,1,4
Finally a generic for Hyzaar!,5,5,5
I was taking benicar htc for the last 4 months and it worked great but the cost was too high even with insurance. I changed to losartan-hctz100/12.5 which is the generic for hyzaar. It is every bit as effective as benicar with no side effects. My blood pressure without medication is 150/95. With losartan it runs 115/70. I highly recommend this cost effective medication. ,5,5,5

"In less than a month, I've developed a horrible dry cough which sends me into fits of choking and gagging.  It's so bad, it wakes me up during the night.  I feel like my body is moving through quick sand.  The physical fatigue is unbearable. I also have had a low grade headache for days on end with a bit of dizziness.   ",5,1,1
"Took only one (1) 10mg pill.  My face had excessive swelling (cheeks,lips,under eyes, throat) for 2-3 days.",5,1,3
"Ok, Solved the dry cough and headaches. If you have them as I did you are dehydrated, because of the Hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic). Hydrate. You should be drinking 32 oz. plus of water just for good health. It does not make a difference whether you are thirsty or not.  You can be dehydrated and never feel thirsty. Dry cough will definitely go away and I will bet the headaches will follow.  I have never had other symptoms.",5,5,5
"I have been using this medication for a little over 90 days now. In the beginning I had some light headiness but it subsided. Now I have this God awful dry cough and can now sleep an entire 24 hours if I could. I am always tired. Now I'm having stomach pain to which I thought it was a 24 hour virus. The pain isn't as bad as it was before but it's still there. The other night I was having tingling in my foot so now I've become concerned about these side effects. If these side effects continue, I will check to see if my dosage needs to be decreased. I'm currently on the 20/25 mg one time a day dosage.",5,3,5

Took first pill today;-) 20/12.5htcz. So far nothing crazy. Ill update soooooon.,5,5,5
"When I took the first pill, I got a migraine and had to take a nap to try to sleep it off.  When I awoke, I was nauseous and did vomit.  I had to get my blood pressure down in one day to be able to have a tooth extracted which required a numbing drug to be administered to be able to remove the tooth. So, again I took another pill the following day before my dental appointment, and again I vomited and had a migraine.  BUT, my blood pressure went down and I had the tooth removed.  I won't take that drug again, though.  And, with the tooth removed, my blood pressure is normal to slightly high.  So, staying off the pills for now.",3,1,3
I have had no issues with this medicine outside of a little dry cough for the first week. It brought my blood pressure down wonderfully.,5,5,5
I started taking this and right away felt dizzy standing and my right arm felt tingles in it. I went around in a fog then we went to emergency room and they could not figure out what was wrong. I then called my pharmacy who told me to quit taking it. I feel much better now and going back to my Dr to get another type drug. While working out at the gym a man told me he had the same symptoms when taking it. ,1,1,1
"I have High Blood Pressure, and because my pressure was not stable with just the HCTZ, she prescribed me this medication. I have taken, as directed, for 2 weeks now, and have noticed a cough, especially at night, and slight dizziness within the first 2 hours of taking it. I check my blood pressure twice a day, and with the medication, has been normal, thank goodness, but I sit at a desk all day, and the dizziness is really bothersome.",4,3,4
"My cardiologist started me on Lisinopril for my chf when I was first diagnosed in October 2008.  Beginning with the lowest dosage, my Dr. increased my dosage incremently each succeeding year.  There were 6 month intervals where I had to stop the higher dosages for a while and then re-introduce the higher dosage.  This way my body accepted the higher dosage.  I am now at 40 mg twice daily and I feel fine.",4,4,4
"I have interrupted sleep and wake up around 2-3am and can not get back to sleep. Also, there is more confusion and some dizziness.",4,3,3
"The medication works, but it gave me terrible stomach issues from day one.  It was like having the worst heartburn ever. Also had nausea, weakness, dizziness as well.  Going back to using just Lisinopril without the added Hydrochlorothiazide. ",4,1,4
Does this medication cause weight loss?  I started taking this at the end of Sept. and it's mid-March and I've lost almost 15 pounds without changing eating habits or exercise.  It did work to lower my blood pressure.,5,5,5
"Did an excellent job of lowering my BP, but it made me feel exhausted, heavy, lethargic. Headaches and just a bit ""off"".",5,2,5
Can this med cause weight gain?  I walk 6 days a week and have not changed my diet.  I have been on this for a month,5,3,4
my only issue is a rash if i stay out in the sun - itchy and annoying for a day or two,4,4,4
"After having reasonable BP readings for years, they spiked and were in the region of 190/110 for a week.  Within 24 hours of taking this medication they dropped to 138/80 and within a few days have hovered around 120/80.  No side effects at all so far.  ",5,5,5
"I've only taken it one week, but I am extremely tired, have very bad nausea, slight headache.  Not sure if it has been long enough to make a determination.",1,1,1
I was taking 25mg and it lowered my blood pressure some.  The major thing was the dizziness and severe constipation.  My whole stomach area felt like my insides were going to come out.  It was terrible!  Had to switch meds!,1,1,1
"I've never had high BP until 2 weeks ago, an episode after serious migraine. I've had high BP only after surgeries.I developed a dry hacking cough. This medicine kinda works and now my BP is too low and that feels worse-like I'm passing out, dizzy, unbalanced on my feet. I play golf (walk the course), ballroom dance, do water exercise classes, and have never been ""off balance"". In the evening hours my BP goes back up and it's hard to get to sleep and stay asleep. If this is the answer, I'm not happy with it. I've taken it only every other day and opposite days just the diuretic alone to give my body/mind a break. Being a ""space cadet"" mentally is the pits! Researching other meds and solutions-best of luck to those that stay on it. ",1,1,3
I have been taking this drug for years and none of the side effect mentioned ever happened to me. I am surprise of this. It worked fine for me.,5,5,5
"Third medication all have made me lightheaded, dizzy but this is the worst.  The cure is worse than the problem in my view.  Think I'm going to quit the medicine and do some research  Get dizzy just turning over in bed at night, upset stomach, no energy, headaches, quiver on inside (nervous).  I think I may find a new Dr.  I don't like pill pushers.",3,1,2
I have been on this blood pressure medicine for six weeks one 20mg per day I get very dizzy in the morning when I wake up and try to get out of bed. I have a light dizzy feeling most of the day. I think I will lose weight and find more natural ways to lower my blood pressure,2,2,5
"Was on this drug for about two years and had a cough that bothered me daily, keeping my husband up at night as well as myself. A doctor I work for asked if I was on Lisinopril and I said I was.  She said that one of the lesser common side effects was a cough.  Last week started on another drug and I feel like the cough is subsiding.",5,1,3
"I have been taking it for 1 week and if I had not read the other reviews I would think I had a serious illness...I can hardly walk from the house to my car my legs are so weak and achy. Constant nausea, stomach pain and dizzy/faint feeling. I am thinking I had rather have high BP and risk a heart attack as to feel this way:(",3,1,4
"day one dizzy, tired lack of energy, headache & eye pain. I am not going to continue with this pill. Think i will try health living . I hate this medicine i cried all day depression was bad. taking 10/12.5 and my dr was me to cut them in half but i say no more.",5,1,2
"Lisinopril by itself did not control my BP, doc added HCTZ and numbers lowered.  No cough or spasms, have had some weight gain and hair loss, but not sure it is due to this drug or just the joy of aging. ",5,4,4
Was taking Diovan  and asked about something on the WalMart $4.00 list and was prescribed Lisinopril-HCTZ in the 20/12.5 dosage. This worked for about a year then my BP started to drop below 100/65. Started to take a half a pill and the BP went back to 116/72. Pulse rate stayed constant 68+/- 2 points. I have had no cough issues but just a small amount of a rash which goes away during the winter when I am indoors all the time. When first diagnosed with hypertension it was 220/115 at age 60. I am now 71 with a BP of 117/72 and feel just fine but I don't take any other medications other than the 81mg of asprin.,5,5,5
"I was on another medication for two decades that made me so tired that I refused to take it in the morning -- only at night. As a result my blood pressure was scary.  Other meds have given my migraines, so I felt there was no hope. A new doctor put me on this one.  I was not hopeful at first. In the beginning my blood pressure dropped low and made me dizzy in the morning, but it soon corrected.  I've been on it now for 5 years+ and I am so grateful to be done with the worry about my blood pressure and not feel tired.   I do tend to get the dry cough at bed time, but over time, this problem has diminished. If it ever bothers me, I use Biotene liquid, just a squirt, and I go right to sleep. I'm 65. I dance and I work full time. This medication has been a godsend for me.",5,4,5
"Shortly after starting this med I began to have episodes of itching and swellings.  My lips wound swell up or my fingers would swell and itch.  My PC said this drug had the capability of causing this problem but didn't think it was the culprit because the swellings and itching would last from one to two days then subside before returning again. My PC thought that the swellings, once present, would not subside as long as I was still taking the drug daily. After months of dealing with this, my Cardiologist, who first agreed with my PC, finally concluded that it was, indeed, this drug that I was having an adverse reaction to.  After stopping it, I had one more episode of swelling and itching before it stopped all together.  I'm now on, what my Cardiologist referred to as "" a cousin"" of Lisinopril/Hctz and was told it could react in the same way. I've only been taking ""the cousin"" for about five days and I'm hoping I have a better experience.",4,2,3
"I have never had such a bad reaction to medication as I did to this one. I was only on it three days, and thanks to reviews on this website & others I recognized quickly that I was experiencing the ""rare"" stomach problems, as well as dizziness when standing and also lightheadedness while walking outdoors. My blood pressure dropped too low the first day.  I took the first dose in the morning, by evening my stomach was upset. It got progressively worse the following day, and by that evening my stomach was distended, and my entire abdomen was very tender to the touch. I could not get in any comfortable position lying or sitting, couldn't even have clothing touching the waist area. The stomach cramps were constant and became the intensity of labor pains. The pain was horrible, and I also had light diarrhea even tho I was not eating anything but broth. The information that came with the medication listed this as a ""rare side effect"", and the nurse at my doctor's office initially did not think it was related. I mentioned my research on the internet showed it could indeed be a serious side effect, and after consulting with the doctor I was switched to another drug. When my husband picked up the new prescription, another pharmacist said that yes, some people do have that reaction. After stopping the medication, I was improving within 12 hours and recovered within 24. I had previously not had problems with either Toprol or Diazide for high blood pressure, but am having to take birth control pills for menstrual issues and that has raised my BP. This medication was listed with many more possible side effects than others I have taken, so I have to wonder why it is so often prescribed. I think it is probably that it is low cost. For me, not worth it and never again!",1,1,3
"64 years old have been on it for several years. Nurses had a hard time finding blood pressure the other day 102/60 never been that low. Othostatic hypotension , dizziness when I stand from lying or sitting position. Loss of energy, dyspnea, excessive tiredness.",3,2,4
"I started taking this medication about 7 months ago, my blood pressure fell into the normal range but I have had a horrible cough since shortly after I started taking it.  Tired all the time, vision getting worse, doctor said that it was just allergies so told me to take an allergy pill.  The coughing also has made my acid reflux worse.  The coughing is bad enough to make phone conversations for work difficult.",5,2,5

"Update from 4/18 'Took this drug ONE TIME'. Dr. is calling my experience an allergic reaction. No longer taking Lisinopril. Have been on Metformin for 3 days now. This medication is for the control of high blood sugar. I'm borderline diabetic they say. (Blood test results came back in time for my re-evaluation visit). The reviews on this med are very encouraging & so far no side effects. It's very cheap also. 4 dollars for one month. 1/'13 - weight was 230. I am 6'0"". Rode my bicycle just shy of 1000 miles that year. No weight loss in fact I gained a couple of pounds. Muscles not responding to the exercise. Extremely frustrating. How is that even possible? lol Over the winter I gained 15 more pounds. I now weigh 246lbs. Many people taking Metformin claim substantial weight loss & good results from exercise. Blood pressure down. I am very encouraged at this point.",1,1,1

While it is great for the BP my ranges are now 75-125 and sometimes lower, I have developed some chronic hoarseness that seems to be getting a little worse each day.

I have always been thin and am a fairly short female. My concierge nurse watches my kidney function every 3 mos.  So far no problem. A druggist friend suggested not to use it because I don't have any swelling anywhere in mu body. However my bp is still somewhat high: avrg 145/85 - Thank you for this website - Have used only Hydroclthz w/o lisinopril.",5,3,2

"I start taking the Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg / 12.5 mg tablets about twenty-one days ago and I've been pleased to say; it  has helped to control my blood pressure significantly.  However, about a week ago I started experiencing severe spasms that occurs daily.  It's worse in PM when retiring for the evening, and the AM.  The spasms usually start in my toes and travel up my legs, hips, and neck.  I'm not sure if the spasms are caused by taking this prescription, or if taking it along with other prescriptions that could be causing the spasms.  I am taking 70mg of Vyvanse, 10mg Activan (only as needed), 15 mg Adderrall (as needed, usually twice a week). I don't know what is going on but it's pretty scary.",4,4,4

"It has kept my BP in check but I get the dizziness and remain somewhat tired.  I have recently changed my job and living situation to something less stressful.    One day when I got a bad case of the dizzies after doing some yard work I checked and my BP was extremely low.  I naturally figured maybe the dosage was too high so I started taking half a tab.  All went well, I felt much better and the numbers stayed good.  Then I dropped it altogether and after a few days my BP had shot back up to the danger zone.  Apparently its effects last a while.  So I'm back to the safe region but waiting to get a dr appt here in my new location to get this back under proper control",5,3,5
"I had been on straight lisinopril, but for some reason my Dr. wanted me to switch to the combo med.  I guess it worked on the BP, but I was ""up all night"" having the most vivid and disconcerting dreams imaginable.  I felt like I hadn't slept at all when I got up in the morning.  Took the med for about 3 weeks then went back to plain old lisinopril.  ",4,1,4
This works for me for the HBP. typical side effect of frequent urnination and ED,5,4,5
My Dr. bless his soul told me because I take calan ER 240mg. to only take if my pressure is high as taking Lisinopril 10mg daily can drasticly lower my BP.so it works for me,3,3,3
"Take it for ""situational"" HBP, have experienced major hair loss and my chronic pain seems worse since I've been on it. Having more muscle aches/spasms as well as markedly increased urination:( Dr. will not change it says it's not the med, rather from stress. Strangely, things were not like this before I was put on it but that doesn't seem to matter:( Trying to find alternate ways to keep things under the 140/90 mark. ",5,2,5
I use this medication for high blood pressure control.  I previously used another medication but it caused me to gain over 15 pounds in 2 month time frame.  My doctor then changed the medication to this one and my weight went back to normal within 2 months after the switch.  My side affects are minimal although I do get the cough assoicated with taking the medication but cough drops help considerably.,5,5,5
"I was prescribed Lisinopril/HCTZ, 12.5mg tablets/once per day. My first day on it, I felt mildly dizzy and my BP dropped significantly. The 2nd & 3rd days I took half a pill, (pharmacist ok'd). Both days, within 4-6 hours after taking half/pill I felt extremely tired, where I could barely keep my eyes open.  Today (day 4) I decided  NOT to take this medication at all. So far, no tiredness.  I'm assuming this symptom was from the Lisinopril/HCTZ.  I've read all the possible symptoms. ""Feeling weak, drowsy"" is listed.  Just to clarify; I felt beyond drowsy. I had problems staying awake, even though I had plenty of sleep prior to taking it.  Has anyone else felt this way?  Thanks  ",5,2,4
i take 10 mg a day ,5,5,5
"the side affects that I have been experiencing are coughing, headaches, scratchy throat,heavy mucus or phlegm,dizziness,and sometimes a slight fever.The most annoying is when I cough it makes my head ache and I constantly have to spit out the phlegm as I do not like to swallow it.",1,1,3

They were like charlie horses in my toes, under my rib cage, my left torso, right torso, under my chin. It was weird!

Unfortunately the brand name is now in manufacturers recall so now taking something else but would never take lisinopril again. Didn't see this as a side effect.",4,1,3
"Started taking about 2 months ago, the first month was fine (except for an occasional leg muscle cramp) Into the 2nd month, I developed a dry-cough that got continually worse, finally to the point of creating other problems (hernia from couching so hard!)  I only take 2 other meds so have narrowed the problem down to this one pill! Finally stopped taking it 4-5 days ago, and am slowly starting to feel better each day - what a nightmare.  FYI: For leg cramps (charlie-horses, etc.) a friend told me to get a bar of Ivory soap (!?) just for the heck of it a put a bar on my nightstand (where I get a slight whiff of it), and....amazingly, I haven't had a single muscle cramp since!!

I take the meds in the morning but I also have to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and it seems like I urinate forever.

I called my Dr that was in AL, I moved to MS, and told the on call Dr my meds and soon as I told him Lisinopril he said that was causing it. Even though on it for years. No my husband is having same prob with his lower lip, so calling Dr tomorrow to report this. He was on this less than a yaer so he had reaction long before me, just glad it was during the day this happened. but he was saying swollowing was sort of a problem so have been watching and asking questions. But I was feeling it was the med...guess it was.",2,1,2

My BP had been really bad for 2 – 4years steadily going higher and higher with heart palpitations and with my eyes sight becoming extremely blurred it was clear I needed some help.  I have now been taking this medication for 10 days with daily monitoring. My BP this morning is 122/69 and heart rate at 77.  Slight dizziness after I take it in the morning.  There is a slight urge to cough (not often thou) during the day, but am a water drinker so continuing with the water certainly seems to help.  Of course, urination but through the prior years I was retaining my water and felt extremely terrible.  I am now not retaining water weight and am so good with all of that.  Begin an exercise class of Zumba 5 weeks ago, and enjoy it immensely one hour a day – 3 days a week.  So far, I think this medication is great!  I would not want to live with such high BP that would bring side effects of stroke, heart attack and etc.  We will see what the future brings, but so far - so good. My doctor rocks and he’s the best.  ",5,5,5

Eyes runny, sore throat, heart palpitations, feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. Very dizzy and exhausted. Was in the sun for maybe 10 minutes an just about passed out. Can not focus. Will forget what i'm saying in mid sentance. Legs hurt terribly. BP has has dropped to an average of 87/43. Just not myself anymore.

I missed work, could not sleep well, coughed a lot, and basically felt ""disconnected"" from myself. I spoke with several relatives who had been prescribed this medication, and everyone of them ended up in the ER after a time because of this drug. I would rather live with the high BP (145/90) than continue to feel the way this drug makes me feel.

I have had legs that ache sometimes but it was far worse not taking the meds. My eyes are a lil brownish at times but eye drops can take care of that. I did find out though that you have to be careful to stay cool and in not too much sunlight. To me these are small sacrifices to wake up feeling healthy.

Now I am experiencing fatigue, and an excellerated heart pace when doing activies such as climbing the stairs in my home. I feel very weak and almost nervous as a result.

Does anyone know if there are side effects from the sun?  I have been getting sun burn a lot more frequently than normal.,4,4,4

Nasty Side effects - Lisinopril immediately lowered my blood pressure from 145/95 to 110/75 but after ten days caused me to constantly cough until my throat started to bleed. I was coughing so much people thought I had some highly contagious deadly disease. The severity of the coughing decrease drastically within 48 hours of halting the regieme but it took two weeks before the coughing stopped completely. When I tried to resume the Lisinopril/HCZ regime the dry coughing sideeffect started within hours not days - so my body is now hyper allergic to Lisinopril. The only good thing about this drug was that as a generic drug it was it only cost $15 for 90 days compared to the name brand ACE II inhibitor drug which costed around $60 for 30 days. ,1,1,1

Several wks ago he went off it again, but his bp went up so last night he took 1/4 pill. Today he's itching terrible again. It always has controlled his bp, even w/only 1/4 pill (10-12.5 mg).

Dry mouth, sweating, diarrhea, leg cramps, severe dizziness, cold clamy feet, cough that is very bad at night. A month ago my doctor thought I was having panic/anxiety attacks and treated me with medication for that. I was not satisfied with this remedy so I had researched Lisinopril and found that most people had the same reactions as I did and were too treated for anxiety.

Unhealthy feelings, nausea.Cough causes sleeping difficulties.Feelings of fatique,slight dizziness/groggyness.Frequent urination. Body action rejection symptoms. This product may work but side effects I have experienced not worth the benefit. Concerns of self poisoning with product by body side effects response to it. I question whether risk is worth reward on this combo product. Blood pressure and heart beat out control last few years but at least felt healthy without product. It is no fun feeling sickly taking it. HDC did not work alone with me. Combo of two might be, to soon to tell, however both drugs combined are doing little or nothing with racing heartbeat situation. Taking this two-drug combo concerns me as much as having high blood pressure and not being able to do anything about it. An aging problem I guess we all must deal with somewhere down the line.Summation: To many negitive side effects between the two drugs. Will seek other options from doctor. The smoker's cough/dry heaves and nausea alone will make you want to discontinue this blood pressure treatment. Still on treatment and not a happy camper. What to do?   ",5,1,4

Discharged on same new BP meds Lisinopril-HCTZ 20/12.5mg 1 in am and Amlodipine Besylate 5mg -1 in pm. Both are new for me (starting 2nd wk).

Massive hair loss from this stupid drug!  Was on Benicar with no side effects and doctor decided to give me the generic.  Wow!  This same thing happened when I took Atenolol and I had to fight to get another drug. Doctor kept saying it was probably hereditary and I argued until I got the Benicar.

Now, after a few months it stays around 90/70 and when I drink alcohol, it shoots up to about 138/80, then back down the next day. This drug is easy to take (orally), only one a day. I'm on the 20/12.5. I don't like taking medicines because of side effects. However, this one had no side effects on me. I highly recommend for high blood pressure. ",5,5,5

Prior this taking this medication my average blood pressure was high (180/145, 170/160, 150/120 ... ect).

I didn't realize until I went to my doctor that the cough I have is a side effect.  He realized that it started about 2 weeks after I stared the Quinapril. Not a happy camper at this point as this was a replacement drug from my pharmacy because of insurance changes.,5,1,3
I took this drug 4 days - only to realize the dry coughing I was doing night and day was a side effect!  I am a singer.  The coughing not only kept me from singing - it kept me from sleeping!,5,1,1

"after taking this medication for several months I became extremely ill, so dizzy and ill feeling that I could not stand or funtion. Hoarse. Doctors ran emergency tests on my pacemaker and heart but found no problems. Tried a medicine for iner ears problems but that was not working even after 2-5 day treatments. Finally stopped Inspra because it was the last medicine perscribed and within 36 hours I was fine and have remained fine ever since. Was on Inspra once before several years ago and had problems with hoarseness and sore breasts (I'm a man) and quit then for those reasons but was told the drug had been improved.

"At first i felt good but the longer i took it the more issues i had. Started with the cough and the flem, moved on to feeling some what tied and lethargic.  Got to the point i felt like i had a light hangover all the time. Had to push myself to do day to day work. After walking i would feel tired and a bit shakey. Not to the point of actual shakes, but a bit unsteady. My head felt heavy inside. My body felt tired no matter the amount of time i slept.",4,1,4

"I was prescribed this drug for borderline high blood pressure. After taking it for a few days I developed a cry cough, lost my voice, was dizzy, nauseated and so tired I only wanted to sleep.  Impossible to drive. When I checked the side effects I just went down the list checking every one that was listed.  Although I was only on it for a week, the cough and loss of voice has continued. Now I'm afraid to try another medication for the blood pressure.",3,1,2
"I havve borderline high blood pressure.  I experienced no negative effects from lisenopril.  I had heard about the cough that was possible to develop, but thankfully this did not occur.  I have not noticed that it causes drowiness for me, though I only take it at night.  ",4,3,4
I started taking this drug at the end of September 2016. I had the first instance of the worst abdominal pain I'd ever experienced within the first month. The first episode only lasted about ten minutes but subsequent episodes lasted longer until on the 3rd of January 2017 I ended up in the ER. Diagnosis was acute Pancreatitis. Supervising physician didn't think it was caused by this drug but the gastroenterologist who was consulting listened to me and switched me to amlodipine. My white blood cell count began to drop and I was released on the 8th of January. Haven't had anything like it since.,5,1,5
"The first day I started taking this I developed a dry cough and fatigue. Soon I didn't have a voice, was depressed, so tired I couldn't do anything but sleep. Finally after a week I looked up the side effects of it and went down the list. I had every side effect that they had listed.  Not a good experience. ",1,1,1
"Been on Lisiniprol for almost 3 years. Always had a cough I just thought I had allergies.  After talking to other people that had been on it, I finally figured out why I was always thirsty and the last few months the cough got so bad it affected my life in every aspect including work.  My shoulder blades and ribs hurt so bad because  of it. My voice changed very raspy. About 3 weeks ago I lost my voice completely for 4 days. This has happened to me 5 times in 3 years.  I finally figured why all this happened. Got off it asap.  If you start coughing get off if it.",5,1,5

"I had the aforementioned Severe Allergic Reaction.  This very rare condition is common enough that the ER staff IMMEDIATELY said ""oh, we know what this is.""  The ER doctor called up the drug on a search engine, clicked 'images,' and showed me dozens of pictures of others with the exact same symptoms.   This was extremely frightening, and this reaction seems much more common then Extremely Rare.  This non-medical professional recommends looking for an alternative.",2,1,2
"Doc kept increasing dosage.  Presently on 40mg 2x daily.  Now have scleroderma, a rare autoimmune disease.  Anyone elseâ??s got the same problem?",2,1,2
Lisinipril had the terrible side effect of a dry hacking sporatic cough.  Had to keep sucking on cough drops while I gave it two weeks to work.  The cough seemed to get worse over the few wks.  Dr changed med immmediately.,3,1,3
My pressure was 140/80 with a mild headache a couple times per day. Started this medication and headaches increased severely making me cry and I became very tired by end of day with pressure increasing to 165/90. bad deal for me went back to previous medicatin,1,1,1
"Been taking for a number of years. May be losing effectiveness due to changes in diet, age, weight, cholesterol. ",3,3,3
This medication worked well at lowering my blood pressure however the side effect of a persistent hacking dry cough was unbearable and continually caused a sore throat. ,5,2,3
"I've been taking lisinopril for about 3 months. Blood pressure is normal but the gagging cough is too much. The lack of sleep and dry mouth are also pushing me over the edge. Called dr. today, we'll see what the new drug brings.",5,1,4
"I have been taking this for 5 years and I have experienced nosebleeds and fatigue. Within the last 6 months i have been getting headaches, spikes in blood pressure, dizziness, and blurred vision",2,2,2
"I've used it for 15 years or more. Just had an ""angiodema"" which sent me to the emergency room. My lips and cheeks swelled up. It was treated with antihistamines and steroids. I was told to stop taking lisinopril which is an ""ACE inhibitor"" which can cause angiodema.I did have a few previous cases of angiodema which were mild and easily treated. My doctor at that time did not know what was causing the swelling. I am now taking a different medication, not in the ACE inhibitor class.",5,2,5
"I took 20mg 1x/day for about 2 weeks. Initially it seemed to be working well. At about 1.5 weeks I started having blood pressure spikes in the 170/110 range with a feeling of pressure in my head and ears, and a feeling like someone was continuously sqeezing my neck. The doctor added Norvasc but 3 days later my pressure spiked to 180/115  with my left arm getting weak and numb. I had to stop the Lisinopril for 6 days for several tests. The morning after I started back on it I experienced the same issues again when I had been feeling better. The reaction I was having is known as Angioedema ... essentially an allergic reaction to ace inhibitors which is the class of drugs Lisinopril is in. I am now taking 10mg Norvasc 1x/day and am feeling better.",4,1,1
I took 20 mg per day for 3 years with little to no effect on BP. I tried 40 mg for 30 days with no effect. BP was the same with or without taking this drug. ,5,1,1
"I was on Lisinopril 40 ml for 3 moths. It worked great for lowering my blood pressure. It went down from 180:100 to 110: 70. I had to stop it because the side effects. I lost my energy, I started forgetting everything, started feeling calm and kind of depressed, acting like a zombi. I lost my interest to my job, to everyday routine. I worked like a robot. My kids started asking me: Mom, whatâ??s wrong with you?But my blood pressure was perfect. I decided to stop taking it without my doctor advice, put myself on diet and started taking my grandmaâ??s old fashion remedies. My babysitter also was on Lisinopril 20 ml for 5 years. It worked good for her until it stopped working and her blood pressure went up and she passed away while slipping at the age of 63.",2,1,2
I have been taking this medication for two weeks with great results and only a slight cramping in my stomach on three different days for approximately ten minutes. BP has gone from 169/101 to an average of 134/78 for the past 5 days.,4,4,4
"Started Lisinopril on Christmas Day and over the course of a month my bp went from 160/90 to 123/71 with no side effects to speak of. Got a refill (different manufacturer) and within 2 days started having a terrible cough, problems breathing and after a couple more days had a paralyzed throat and was unable to swallow. Bad feeling!!! Took two rounds of Benadryl to counter the allergic reaction and stopped Lisinopril altogether. Went a week without meds and bp shot up to 150/102. Just started Amlodipine. Note that I'm a new bp patient so we're still searching for what works...",3,1,3
20 MG NEVER DID LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE,5,2,1
I was only on this medication for two weeks 10 mg. The coughing was terrible. I stopped 4 days ago . Feeling a bit better. Never again.,5,1,1
Made me cough horribly for weeks until I stopped taking it.  The doctor did not tell me about this possible side effect so I had no idea when I was coughing/chocking.  It was a fluke that I figured out it was this drug.,1,1,1
Created a terrible side effect of a very persistent cough nasty enough that it affected me conducting business and being able to sleep lying down... was on it for 5 months thinking the cough was caused by something else.  Stopped taking it and 3 days later the cough was 100% gone. ,5,1,1
"Lisinopril 40 mg manufactured by Lupin is not effective at all for me.  It is as if I took no medication at all.  This problem is ONLY the lisinopril manufactured by LUPIN.  Other manufacturers I have no problem and the drug works effectively.  Unfortunately, Lupin is the cheapest manufacturer so that is what is most commonly supplied.  If you take lisinopril manufactured by Lupin monitor you blood pressure.",5,1,1
"While it did lower blood pressure,  it also caused a blood clot in the lungs,  a fast heart beat problem (pulse = 160/min),  turned my bowel movements to chili consistency (took a year of no lisinprol use to correct) and gave me such lethargy/malaise that I felt like doing nothing.  Overall,  avoid like the plague.  Unfortunately the high blood pressure fixation by medical world is a financial scam and they make its treatment a gateway to get other treatment you actually do need.   An outrageous practice by the medical world.",4,1,4
"Used this medication for a very short time and developed a chronic dry cough.  Once discontinued, cough slowly went away.",5,1,1

"I have been taking Irbesartan for 3+ years, but had pain and swelling of legs and ankles so starting this year Dr. switched me to Losartan. I also had occasional dry cough all along so to see if it made any difference he switched me a few months ago to Lisinopril 40mg and the cough got worse! Switched back to Losartan as pharmacist says it is next gen drug better than Lisinopril. Ok so cough almost gone. Note: All drugs have side effects, even if by a small %. No Dr. or Pharmacist or Drug maker will tell you everything you need to know. You are not just a statistic filed with the FDA. Go back to nature!",3,1,1
"I took this medication for at least two years. It did a great job of managing my moderately high blood pressure, but it gave me a dry cough. The cough wasn't too bad until I compounded it with a viral illness - after that my airways were raw, my mouth burned, and I lost my sense of taste. I stopped taking it two months ago - my mouth feels quite a bit better and am just starting to get my sense of taste back. I would take it again because it was so effective but the side effects are too much to bear. ",5,1,5
"Story. i had a severe chemical sensitivity to my hands,skin would crack long time to heal. Only drug that would help was prednisone. Had taken it for 22 years. 3 months after taking lisinopril i no longer take pred. Skin problem with hands has disappeared now for 3 years.   ",3,4,3
"I was put on this medication 2yrs ago for HBP. Yes it helped bring my pressure down, but I am finally convinced it is the cause of my many terrible symptoms. I believe it has been slowly poisoning me. Itchy skin and strange hives that I thought were spider bites, swollen watery eyes, a sun burned feeling under skin, electrolyte problems, cramping in legs, feet and hands, headaches and extreme exhaustion. today was my last dose. Never again.  I will go natural and cut out all sugar, gluten, walk, yoga and breathing exercises.  I am very upset with myself that I stayed on this awful drug for so long. It only gave me an excuse to not try harder and it was debilitating. I believe I was on the verge of a life threatening allergic reaction.  Oh and of course I had the Lisinopril cough like so many.  It is sad that we end up in desperate situations and have to go this route sometimes, but I believe this drug is ONLY  meant for a short term in order to buy time in getting the weight off or eating better, more exercise etc. Otherwise it will eventually cause terrible damage.  I wish everyone luck with whatever your choice but I have done a lot of research and I am convinced this is a very bad choice and extremely dangerous. I sure hope these terrible symptoms go away!",3,1,3

"i have been on this medication for a couple of years, during that time I have suffered from severe stomach issues.  I thought it was something else until this last weeek I had to be admitted to the hospital.  Come to find out that every single side effect that this drug has, I had.  I have talked to my Dr. about putting me on a different med for my issue.  If this happens to you it might be the meds that you take and not you personally.",5,2,5
"I began using Lisinopril 10mg for high blood pressure about two years ago when my dr said it was the least likely of BP meds to cause liver damage. In December of last year I began having an intense rash on my body, which I attributed to something else initially. In addition, since using the med I have battled with lots of phlegm. I had also begun experiencing extreme muscle pain in my right leg but I was on a statin drug at the same time for high cholesterol, so the dr thought that was what caused this problem. However, while the muscle pain greatly diminished after I went off the statin, the muscle problem did not go away entirely. I still had fatigue and muscle tiredness while on this drug. I went off this med a week ago. I have gone on another bp med (amlodipine 5mg twice a day), but I am finding it is giving me negative symptoms too, but at least the body rash and leg muscle pain is much less on this med. However, the face and leg heat/flushing and extreme fatigue are worse. My dr is changing my med again; this time it will be Benicar, but I am concerned after reading there are a lot of lawsuits against its manufacturer. It makes one think high blood pressure may be the lesser of the many evils but my father had a heart attack at my age so......",4,1,4

REALLY BAD COUGH AND BAD CRAMPING AND SOMETHING LIKE RESTLESS LEG SYDROME,2,1,3
My blood pressure stays close to 128/82 with this medicine.,5,5,5
Extreme pain in legs and  cramping in feet and legs.  Went off and witin 2 weeks all the pain from the many months prior stopped.  Unforunately the swelling/cramping in the feed caused what appears to be permanent damage.  Swelling was not viewable but dr said it was from potasium build up which caused the pain and damage,3,1,4
Though taking 40 mg has decreased my BP into safe levels the chronic cough is awful.  It took five weeks of 27/7 coughing finally realize the cause of the medication.,4,1,4
worst dry cough and hacking cough,5,1,4

"I seem to get cramps sideache, I noticed every time I take that felt like I ran for miles and then get side ache strange...",2,2,2
"This is an ACE inhibitor, a class of antihypertensives loved by MDs for no good reason.  Like all approved antihypertensives,  ACE inhibitors lower BP, but that is not enough.  Unlike thiazide diuretics  & beta blockers,  ACE inhibitors do not reduce the risk of death or heart attack  unless they are taken in combination with a thiazide diuretic and/or beta blocker.  The best case for the effectives of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of death/heart attack  is a 2014 meta-analysis study.  The stistician who invented meta analysis used to work for me.  We talked a lot about meta analysis.  In the end, neither of us ever used it our own research  because we could never conclude that a meta analysis was believable.    I have hypertension, and I would fire any MD who wanted to prescribe an ACE inhibitor as the only drug to take  & look for an MD who knew what he was doing and prescribed  1) thiazide diuretic, 2]  and/or a beta blocker, 3]  both the above plus an ACE inhibitor  which will further  increase the reduction in risk of death/heart attack    Antihypertensive drugs are approved by the FDA if they reduce blood pressure, but you do not want to lover your  blood pressure.  You want to reduce the risk of death/heart attack  that comes from high BP, and not all ""effective""  antihypertensive drugs do that.",3,3,3

"I was on this for about 3 months.The dry nagging cough was the least of my problems. I had a general feeling of the flu. I couldn't sleep, yet I couldn't get out of bed. Confusion, dissiness, feeling of distress. I went back to my doctor, and he changed meds to something that begins with A and hydro something. Back to this med. I got blood work done in his office. He sent me results with a comment That my sirum ALT had doubled and to cut down on drinking. Strange I thought. Moderate drinker, unchanged. 6 month later I just got new blood work. He sent me both my last and new labs. My sirum ALT went from 68 (high) to 33 (normal). This drug was killing my liver! Read side effects. The other drugs have equally horrable but different side effects. I'm 58 and a workaholic. I'm going to take my chances with stage 2 hypertention because the treatment is worse than the desease.",1,1,1
"I take 10 mg. lisinopril 1 x daily. Effectively controls blood pressure. Doctors had me on hydrochlorothiazide for 1 year with no results before switching me to lisinopril, and now I feel better and confident that medication works for me.

"I switched to lisinopril from hydrochlorothiazide a month ago because of the severe side effects from hydrochlorothiazide. I took 5 mg daily in the evening. It took about a week to take effect, but it worked very well on my BP (110-120/70-80). However I have developed a bad cough. My doctor is switching me to losartan.",5,2,5
Took a while to get used to the tiredness and fatigue but the drug has caused blood pressure and a fib to be very regulated. ,4,5,5

"End of May 2016 I was in the ER and diagnosed with Essential Hypertension (age 36, male). I used to one energy drink a day along with other caffeinated beverages, and smoked/vaped(with nicotine) for about 10 years, as well as drinking way more than my share of alcohol every week/day/night (12pack easy).   I quit alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine all in one movement after that ER incident. Two more times in the ER realized I had a ""hot tooth"" that could not be touched by any type of painkiller due to the massive inflammation. Timeline is critical here now.  After the third time in the ER I was setup with a PCP to be seen in about 10 days, as I did not have one before. I also had a root canal scheduled from an endodontist in 22 days.   Went to my new PCP on day number 10 and he wanted to put me on 20mg Lisinopril-HTCZ (the one that makes you go pee in 30 mins after you take it).  Also switched to a low sodium diet, and stopped eating out. Started exercising (walking) 1 mile or more a day. Began noticing the numbers starting to creep back up and also having extreme cramps in my calves and thighs while walking. I let my PCP know and he switched to the non-HCTZ Lisinopril 20mg.  This is where stuff got weird. Went to the endodontist had my root canal, and BP dropped immediately overnight to a normal safe non-Essential Hypertension level, as I track it everyday. Then progressively as the days went on it creeped back up.   I was unable to sleep in bed lying down anymore due to strange palpitations that didn't register on the BP monitor. Spasms in muscles mainly at joints. Prickly tingly pains like leg went to sleep in foot, hands, and forearm (parasthesia).   Went back to PCP about 4 months into treatment with Lisinopril with a 167/91 that had multi-symptom (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, spasms, insomnia, irregular heartbeat).

"I've been using this medication for about 5 years. This medication works wonderful keeping my blood pressure under control however, within the last year I've started developing a common cough and, I've NEVER had a cough as such especially when I experience laughter.

My cardiologist started me on Lisinopril lowest dosage when I was first diagnosed with chf October 2008.  My dosage has incremently been adjusted over the years until my body has been able to accept the higher dosage I am now taking of 40 mg twice daily.  I feel fine.,4,4,4

"Within 6 days of taking this drug, I developed a severe cough. The cough lessened, but then my intestines were not working right.  I ended up in th ER with severe rectal pain. Drs. said I had a hemmorhoid. I have been taking 400mg of magnesium for 6 months prior to this, so constipation was never an issue, and the pain was so severe I could not function. After visits to  different doctors and no relief of the pain, I consulted a surgeon. When he examined me, he found I had an internal anal fissure with intestinal swelling. I stopped taking the drug lisinopril and my intestines are back to normal with NO pain.",2,1,2
"Cold extremities, achy, general feeling of 'not being myself'...had been on it previously for about 5 mos, quit for about 3 months, felt great, but BP spiked so trying again. Had been given another med to take with this but I'm not going to overdo the meds. Will see how this does this time. If a no-go I'll dry meditation and beet juice (supposed to lower BP).       ",5,3,3
"After only one week at 10 mg/day I experienced leg, ankle, and feet swelling. Extreme fatigue. Body stiffness and all over pain. Headache and scratchy throat. Dizziness.  Two weeks after I stopped taking this med, I was almost back to ""normal.""",5,1,1
"Been on this med 10  years at 10mg/day with no side effects. In 2014, I experienced intense BP spikes 2-3 times a week, primarily at night - highest being 220/110. Clonidine 0.1mg  brings it down in an hour. Had EKG done, with no heart abnormalities but no diagnosis for the spikes.  After three months symptoms suddenly stopped as quickly as they started, and I went back to normal readings (for me, anyway). Two months ago the spikes started again. Cardiologist upped dosage to 40mg/day and BP is still not in an acceptable range - in 140 to 170 over 85 to 100 range.  Thankfully, spikes are not as high as in 2014.  I live alone and am wondering if this could be related to anxiety.  Any similar experience out there?",3,3,3
"Works great for reducing BP, but what started as slightly scratchy throat has me coughing all the time. Developed an itch as well in last week.",4,1,4
This BP medication did not lower my blood pressure even after doubleing my dosage up to 40 mg/ day. ,5,1,1
impotency,4,4,4
"The scratchy feeling in throat . And the tiredness and blurred vision made me stop. Helped with my HBP slightly but side affects were to much,.",3,1,3
"I was prescribed because it prevents hardening of my organs overtime.. I'm type 2 diabetic, and take cholesterol medicine=because I am borderline., before a week was up I woke up feeling like someone had their hands on my throat strangling me. no other symptoms. When I read the side effects. I quickly stopped taking it.",5,1,1
med working fine but concerned that it could cause damage to kidneys and or liver is there any truth to this guess every hypertension drug would ultimately do the same thing.,5,5,5
"It worked great for reducing my high  blood pressure, which was squarely in the high range before I started started taking it.  Unfortunately, after a month, I developed a scratchiness in the back of my throat a couple of times a day.  Over the past 2 months, that has gotten more frequent to the point where the coughing from it is disrupting my sleep. I finally gave up and asked my doctor to switch me to something else.",5,2,5
"VERY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL! I have had high blood pressure for years now. On Propanolol my blood pressure was never below 134, and usually ranged between 140-156. Since starting lisinopril about 4mths ago my blood pressure has been consistently normal. It hadn't been normal for the last 10 years (since i started much needed anti-depresents).",5,5,5
Started taking this medication and I was prescribed 10 milligrams 1 per day. I got called in for a random urine screen and failed due to a false positive for amphetamines. I did some research and come to find out this medication will calls that if you have any stomach issues such as GERD ulcers for indigestion. The end result with me losing my job. Has anyone else had a problem like this?,1,1,1
"After being on Lisinopril for 2 months I developed an inability to clear my throat practically all day long, this has now turned into a very dry cough. I have stopped taking it and I am asking my doctor to prescribe something else.",4,2,3
Started taking lisinopril pills eight weeks ago. At the time I had a cold so I did not notice it for a while but it occurred to me that my cough was getting worse rather than better. Concerned about the cough I went to emergency care and received an antibiotic but the cough persisted. I returned to my doctor who advised me to stop taking the medication as my nights had become sleepless and phlegm and saliva were filling my throat along with sinus dryness and leg/knee pain. I am hopeful that my side effects will soon cease.,2,1,2
my BP is 180/100. optum says this is my only option. it is not working. i am taking 4 pills/ day and i remain in heart attack range. ,3,1,1
"I also have been on this prescribed medication for several years, since being diagnosed with HBP, the doctors kept upping the dose, starting out with 10 mg, to 20mg, and now on 40mg of 1 pill/day.  I was taking this with Omeprozole, for acid reflux, which has no negative interaction w/other meds.  So, earlier in the first years, it was working fine, hadn't noticed side effects until now. Since the last 2 years, been having leg problems, and I, too, have been coughing with it (after reading the other comments from people on this thread).  I've also been prescribed with taking furosemide (water pill) which has a negative interaction with Lisinopril, according to WebMD, interactions with this med may increase HBP levels, and decrease kidney function.  Every blood test I've had (with the VA health care, since I'm a veteran), shown that my kidney functions decreased; and on Dec. 2011, I had one kidney removed for having carcinoma (cancer). By seeing the interaction Lisinpril has with other prescription medications, and after hearing from a friend what this medication does to patients on it, I stopped taking it last week.  Also, I'm on sodium bicarbonate which also has a negative interaction with Lisinopril. I recommend to people to check this drug with your doctor and/or pharmacist for other interactions with medications.  Alone, I guess this drug does its job, but with other medications, its taking a risk of failure or adverse reactions interacting with other medications. ",4,3,4
"I have been taking this medication for over 15 years when first prescribed my Dr said it had the side effects of a glass of water, and I do believe it does and it works.  Great Med. ",5,5,5
"My systolic has gotten much better, but I continue to have a significantly high diastolic reading.  The worst part, though, is the never ending cough.  I'm now known at work as ""the lady in the corner that never stops coughing"".  How embarrassing.  The coughing also prevents me from getting any decent sleep.",4,1,3
"I started having a bad cough and leg cramps after taking this drug.  I knew a cough was a side-effect, so I stopped taking it after about 2 weeks.",2,1,2
"This was one of 3 meds I was on for HBP, I took it for years. I had no problems until this past year. It just about killed me. I started with what I thought was falling for some time these spells lasted a few seconds, I would fall and just get up. Then one night I fell woke up later and knew I had lost time. This was the first time I ended up in the emergency room. The next time I passed out getting a haircut. After this every time I went out I was out longer. The last time I was out more than 3 hours and had a 3rd degree burn to show for it. I fell on my computer and was there so long it burned my leg. After many hospital stays and a lot of testing I was taken off this med and have had no other passing out. I was put back on the med and started back passing out again even on a very small dose. Please be cautious with this med. Even if you think something is odd call your Dr and get off it. It is dangerous. We all know a viper bite can kill us and this stuff is made from snake venom.",1,1,1
"I was taking this and 2 other meds for HBP. Still wouldn't go down and stay. Took it every day for almost a year and one day my tongue and throat swelled up and almost didn't make it to ER. Almost died before they got the Ventilator down my throat (too swollen) to breath. ER Doc said I was about the 20th patient THIS YEAR (April) he's treated for same thing. If your tongue starts to feel thick, go to ER right then. This happened 30 mins to an hour after taking.",3,1,3
"I am 39 male. I started 20mg per day lisinopril about 30 years old. overall , it works. However, it cause coughing, headache(once per spring, once per winter) for me.",4,3,4
"Been on this for years. My BP is 120/80 at home but 164/90 whenever someone else takes it, like the Dr. started out at 10mg and eventually up to 40mg. I finally weaned myself off and are currently arguing with my Dr about white coat anxiety.",4,1,1
While this may be a good medication for high blood pressure this is not for everyone I started taking lisinopril and developed a very bad cough and it was determined that it was the drug so be cautious if you develop a cough that you can't get rid of please check your medications.,5,1,1
"My blood pressure was high at my last physical yesterday: 180 over 110. Doctor prescribed Lisinopril 10mg. Took 1 yesterday afternoon at 2PM. This morning, my BP was 130 over 84! Only side effect was drowsiness, but I'll start taking the medication in the evening from now on.  Makes me more relaxed, and less stressed out when work and home issues arise.  I will continue to use.",5,5,5
One 10mg tablet every morning has been an easy regiment to follow.  Keeps my pb around 120/80 consistently.  ,5,5,5
I really like this medication,4,4,4
I get a little dizzy once in a while Other than that I don't notice any side effects after three years of use. BP is now normal. Was 160. After my heart attack. I'm just glad to sell be alive.,5,5,5
This has kept my BP nicely in control for many years.  the only side effect is that I can get a faint feeling if I stand up too fast but never to the point of fainting.  My Dr. says that is common for these drugs.,5,5,5
I had high blood pressure for the first time in my life. I started taking the medication and immediately had coughing and problems breathing. I stopped and felt better immediately. My doctor put me on a weight loss program and the bp returned to normal within a week.  ,2,1,2
"My BP dropped significantly the very first day of taking this and has remained lower. However, when prescribing it for me, my doctor told me that dry cough is a fairly common side effect. I've now been taking it for three weeks and the 'dry cough' has become so intense and debilitating that I just decided I have to stop. If it was just an annoyance cough I could deal with it, except this is anything but. It comes on with little to no warning and has me hacking to the point of choking.  As such, my throat is sore and my dog looks at me like I'm about to cash out.  No more for me, thanks.",5,1,5
My blood pressure is down,4,4,3
"Started on 20mg with bp at 165/110. Within 5 hours it was down to 118/73. I've only been on it for a week, but my headaches are gone and the constant fatigue is gone.  I think some people's issue is their dosage may not be high enough. ",5,5,5
"I started lisinopril in November. Early December started a cough that would hurt so badly my ribs hurt. It got to the point that I would cough 4 or 5 times in a row, then gag and not cough for an hour. Then the cycle would repeat. Went to my immunologist because thought it was my asthma and allergies. Prescribed steroids and it subsided for 2 days. Once I quit taking the steroids, it can back worse. I cannot sleep, eat and feel miserable all the time. I was reading what could cause chronic cough and came across and article about ACE inhibitors causing chronic cough. LIGHTBULB. Cardiologist verified it was the meds. Wish I would have known this 3 months ago. ",3,2,3
"had side effect , violent coughing constantly for over a month.  first dose did not lower my blood pressure hadto increase dosage. ",5,1,2
"Took this for about 6 months. Initially started with 10 mg per day.  Developed headache and dry cough. Split pill in half thinking half the dose in the morning and half at night would be easier on my system. Headache and dry cough went away.  Lowered blood pressure. Then 6 months later I developed headache, dizziness and nausea to the point I could not drive. Had these symptoms for a month while doctors tried EKG, MRI and a couple of sessions of physical therapy for vertigo. My wife and I questioned if it could be the Lisinopril and the doctor did not feel that was the cause since I was taking it for 6 months already. Quit taking the Lisinopril and headaches were gone in 1 day. The nausea and dizziness come and go but no where to the extreme it was before.",1,1,1
"Facial rash, itchy dark patches on my cheeks.  ",4,1,3
Ive been taking it for 1 years 10 mg to start then Dr. upped it to 20 it made my bp go up really high. Went back to 10 mg and was fine for a year then I had muscle weakness. I had all to do to get up and move around. It really dint do much to lower my bp I just stopped taking it after a few weeks feel much better can move around now no weakness. ,1,1,1
"I was given lisinopril for my blood pressure. After about a year I stopped this medication. It made my ringing of the ears really bad. I was also taking flomax for bph at the time, which i also stopped. I was put on metoprolol. This last made me put on weight for no reason. My toes on tight food started to hurt, I would have trouble breathing  every time I would go for my walks at the park. It was like an allergythat I developed.  I stopped taking metoprolol. I am trying doxazosin to replace both the BP medication and the BPH (enlarged prostate) medication.  Wish me luck :-).",2,1,2
"After taking this drug for nearly 2 years, I suffered a severe angioedema and nearly died.  Ended up in ICU for 3 nights on a ventilator and 5 days total in hospital.  My lips swelled so much that I thought they were going to split open and my throat almost closed completely.  If I had not taken 5-6 Benadryl tablets before going to the ER, I most likely would not have made it.  When I found out how common this reaction is, I am wondering why there is not more emphasis on warning patients about this possibility.",3,1,3
"Thank you to those of you referencing the side effect of a cough; you just saved me time and money. After two visits to the doctor and three prescriptions to cure my ""allergies"" producing the cough, which did not help at all, I connected the dots within 5 mins of reading other reviews. You would think the doctor that prescribed this 2 months ago would have looked at this possibility?? Thank you! ",2,1,2
"Horrible cough, numbness in my left arm and hand which moved to my face and had stroke like symptoms. made Dr switch to another drug, not worth side effects.",3,1,3
Ive been taking it for 3.5 years 20 mg to start then Dr. upped it to 40. Worked well but I now have 45% function of my kineys and went to see a Nephrologist and he said to stop taking it because its killing my kidneys,4,1,4
"This is the worst med I've ever taken .I was prescribed 10 mg to Stat and up it to 20 mg in two weeks .I have not stopped coughing and it is so bad I hold a conversation . I also am so tierd all the time I have to pry myself out of bed .I have vomited ,headaches, diarrhea, Its horable I will not refill my script . I need a new med .this one sucks ",1,1,1
I had an allergic reaction from the manufacturer lispin and almost died.  Emergency room treatment.  Told some African American women have been having an allegic reaction to medication.  My tongue was swollen and almost blocked my air passages.,5,1,1
"I was started on 10mg of lisinopril in August.  I began having a dry cough almost immediately. I knew from the beginning it was a potential side effect. I kept thinking it would go away, but it never did.  I coughed during the day and at night.  My dr switched my medication in December, and the cough began getting better in a couple of days.  No other side effects were noticed. My blood pressure did drop from 150/100 to 130/95 (at dr office) but my blood pressure is usually fine at home.  I expected better results.  ",3,2,3

"I have to say I am satisfied with this because my BP was 164/95 and yesterday, it was 126/84!  The doctor was very pleased also.  I did have a cough at first, but really do not notice it now.  I started at 10, but after a month, the BP was still high and my doctor upped it to 20 which seems to do the trick.  Hopefully, I can keep the BP down and continue to have no bad side effects.",5,5,5
"I was 24 when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. 144/103 were my readings. After 2 weeks it was 108/80. Pretty effective. Being lightheaded suck and I can't do a lot of heavy lifting with almost passing out. When I eat, my whole chin becomes numb. I think drinking more helps that. Still get chest pain, but not as much. Drs say that's just stress. I hate taking this crap, but the cause is genetic so I have to.",4,2,5
The chronic dry cough was horrible.  Switched to another medication.,5,1,5

"After being on 50mg of atenolol for 20 years,my bp went up to 180/100. I added 20mg of lisinopril. While it brought my bp down, I developed a rash,gas, and burning skin. I fell and cracked my head. Doctor switched me to valsartan. After first dose my throat started to tighten and my bp went up to 190 over 127. I didn't think I would make it.I dropped 10 pounds and now just take the atenolol.

"Boarder line HBP. Started on 10mg. Controlled my bp right away, but came at a price. I have worked outside in the Florida heat for 30+ yrs and never sweated this bad! Extreme, excessive sweat! Heat intolerance, itchy throat during the night, and a chronic, dry cough. Went to urologist that told me this lisinopril was not right for me.  Changed me to Telmisartan, 20mg.  Suppose to have less side affects. ",5,1,4
"After taking drug for over a year just recently half of tongue swelled up along with throat. Went to ER they gave me steroids and Benadryl started to diminish and sent me home. Next day dr gave me new blood pressure med Losartan. Within an hour back to ER. Did same treatment some swelling went down not a lot, today can't swallow tongue hurts and throat. No remedy yet. Had many other side affects from lisiniprol that I recently learned of. Once I saw side possible side affects I can only assume my several discomforts came from this med. on line they call this the ""death drug"". Sure wish I knew this stuff back when I first started taking this drug. The bad clearly out weighs any good in this drug. It needs to be banned. ",4,1,4
"I began taking Lisinopril's generic - Ramipril, 5 months ago. Took it at night with dinner. The first 2-3 weeks were great. I felt so much better. Still do. I was given this BP med as a booster to the other 2 BP meds I take. On the other two I would have BP flare ups a lot up into the 140's/90's and on a bad flare up it would go up to high 150's/90's. Would feel terrible. My Dr thought I needed a little help. I didn't want to take a 3rd BP med but boy what a difference! I immediately noticed a difference and my BP stabilized down into the low 120's/80's and sometimes even under 120. Rarely anymore flare ups and if so would only go up into mid 130's/80's. Monthly checkups with my Dr also confirmed this & she was happy. But after 3 weeks I started noticing a dry cough from time to time. It was more of a throat tickle/scratchy throat feeling at the base of my throat that came out of the blue & would cause me to cough & once I started I couldn't stop for several minutes. Cough so hard I almost throw up sometimes. This would come & go. Some days I'm just fine. Told my Dr about it and she said she could switch me to another med in the same family that doesn't cause coughing. Tried to stay on it but now, after 5 months, the coughing fits have worsened and I can cough so hard I pee my pants! Funny but not funny. My son threatens to hide my med and both he & my husband want me to switch. Finally can't take it anymore so I have contacted my Dr and am having her switch me to other med. That one is Losartan so we'll see how I do. If you're coughing - it doesn't get better or go away - so switch your med if you can't tolerate it anymore. No way to live daily. ",5,3,5
"This medication controlled my blood pressure but had my bones and joints aching to the point where i had to stop working. After i discovered it was the lisinopril, i stopped taking it. My bones are still a little sore but at least i'm able to get out of bed without being in tremendous pain. Slowly recovering.",3,1,2
After my first week I woke up with half of my tongue swollen I was rushed to the ER.I was put on life support for six and a half days. ,3,1,1

Was on 2.5 mg for 5 weeks and at doc office BP was 135/90.  Doc prescribed 10 mg or 4 times dose.  Took it and BP dived to 107/69 BUT got aggravating throat cough.  Called doc who changed to another drug.  Meantime I split dose into 2.5 mg and have ben taking it since.  BP is now 115/75 at rest 151/92 when active. BUT - no cough.  So am remaining on this drug with 2.5mg dose as myBP is not sero=ious enough to warrant heavy dose,5,3,3
"I had borderline high blood pressure and was prescribed lisinopril. Until I went to an allergy specialist I did not realize that my chronic cough was not due to allergies/asthma.

"Started on Lisinopril/HTZ combo at 10mg.  Immediately got my BP down from 145/90 to 120/80 within a week.  After about two months, it started to creep back up.  My Dr. upped the amount to 20mg, and that seems to do the trick.  I do get a dry tickle cough from time to time, but very minor.  Overall very effective med for me.  ",4,4,4
"Side effects that mimic a terrible case of flu, extreme fatigue, that ""I feel like I'm going to die, will this ever end"" sensation. I have tried to stay on this med and others like it but never make it past 2 weeks. If this one makes you sick, chances are others of its type will too.",1,1,1

The phlegm was horrible and I would cough so much I would get a head-ache.Coughing in front of my students is not good and makes them and myself worry. If you are on this medication and coughing is a problem, ask to be switched to something different",4,1,4

After two weeks of utter misery while taking this drug, I contacted my PCP and she immediately changed me to something else. The cough took about another 1.5 weeks to subside after discontinuing this med. I have friends who have taken it for years without incident, however. If you're prescribed Lisinopril, expect the worst, and if no horrendous side effects happen, then that's a bonus for you! Good luck!",1,1,1

I don't take any other medication, my BMI is in range and I weigh 175lbs at 6 ft, overall healthy but feel awful since I started on this medication.

"I have been on Lisinopril for about 7 years.  It has been very effective in controlling my BP.  I initally suffered from a mild cough for about 8 months, but it eventually resolved itself.  Nothing like what others are describing.  Based on the timing of when I started taking this, I can't help but wonder if it caused or contributed to my erectile dysfunction.   But I have seen nothing anywhere to suggest that this is a potential side effect, so probably not.  ",5,4,4

"I was started on this medication while also being treated for bronchitis, so didn't attribute the coughing to the medication until the cough didn't go away when the bronchitis did.

These side effects became more common as time went on.  I thought these side effects were the result of my diabetes (Under control) Doctor gave me no clue it was this drug.  I went to another doctor to complain about my nightly  leg pains, and he increased my dose 4x. The first day I increased the dose, my leg pain lasted into the day, and the hand/feet itching increased. So I stopped taking this drug , over several days (Decreasing dosage) myself. I researched this drug online and found thousands of people with the same issue.  I took this drug for about a year with these symptoms increasing over this time. I would complain to my doctor and explain in detail my experiences: and get responses like take Aleve, and anti-itch creams.  The day I was off Lisinopril my hands and feet never itched again, and my nightly leg pain stopped at once. Over several weeks the strength of my legs are getting stronger (90%).

I will contact my doctor and see if there is something else they can put me on.  It does help control my high BP. ",4,3,4
Very effective in bringing down moderately high BP,5,5,5

The drug seems OK but the packaging by International Labs is among the worst I have experienced. It is almost impossible to open. Child-proof?? I'll say! It's everybody-proof. My 30 year old son couldn't do it. No wonder International Labs do not have an email address to complain. I hope Walmart sees this report but I'll tell them anyway.,1,2,3
NONE,1,3,3
"works well, but have started to get headaches.",4,4,4
The doctor started me on this after my blood pressure was like 166 over 125.  The  nurse said they knew someone who died that had a better blood pressure reading (didn't help my blood pressure).

I developed a sever cough.  While having a coughing spell after church two women spoke up and said that it sounded like they did when they took Lisinopril!  All three of us had this severe reaction to this medicine.  My pharmacist and nurse practitioner both agreed that the cough is usually what makes them change from this med. to something else.  ,5,1,1

Started having unexplainable red rash on back, then another year appeared on head.  Doctors did not know what kind of rash it was.  Then numbness on thumb with dry skin, unknown why.  Then last year started numbing and tinging in the fingers and hands December 2013 it started in the arms and legs.  Went off this med and all the above is starting to clear up.

My husband started on this medication and after two months of use...He started an awful cough and nasal drip that is still persistent after stopping it for one weeks..He is going back to the physician and with hope he did not cause any damage to his lungs..I hope that every person who reads this will be scared enough NOT to use it..Side effects are very scary and certainly unpleasant.,3,1,2

Been taking for 6 weeks and it has lowered bp to 130/80 but just recently having severe lightheaded ness and anxiety for no reason. Read that both are common side effects but neither are ok to live with. Afraid to drive my kids around when feeling dizzy and anxiety when everything is going good sucks! Asking dr to change meds. Wish I knew which brand was most tolerable.,5,2,4
After sixty days on drug I was exposed to sun on beach in Florida for 1 hour. Had horrible sunburn to feet and lower legs. Most severe sunburn I had ever seen.  Found out that is common side affect of lisiopril. Also muscle cramps and other effects. Stopped taking drug will have to go to hospital as this looks serious,3,1,3
Lisinopril taken concurrently with hydrochlorothiazide has been effective with decreasing my high b/p has caused some mild intermittent dizziness but the benefits have outweighed this occasional mild side effect.,4,4,4
"I was put on this medicine after having my first child due to me being pre-eclamptic during my pregnancy. My blood pressure never returned to normal so I was stuck on this medicine. I continued to take this medicine over a course of 4 years. During those years, I was constantly experiencing, severe swelling of my ankles, hands, face, and not to mention, overly excessive urination! I was constantly dizzy and felt faint all the time. I had zero energy and all I wanted to do in my spare time was lie down and sleep. My blood pressure stayed elevated. Well, last year I changed PCP's and my new PCP hurried and took me off of this medicine. She told me that studies show that Lisinopril does not work in African Americans, it works against us! So she took me off of it and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide, and immediately all my symptoms went away, and I felt better immediately! I have a few family members that was on this medicine as well, and was experiencing very similar symptoms to mine. So, I told them to get off of it and their existing symptoms would change immediately! So I do not recommend this medicine for people of African/Black American decent.",5,1,1
"I recently started taking lisinopril and the first week i was very nauseous and throwing up, second week severe stomach pain, third week could not stop spitting up mucus, I have been sick from the day i started taking this medication.Females taking this medication should pay very close attention to your breast.

"I started out on 10mg dose,but pressure kept rising,so my ddoctor increased the dose to 20mg..still not effective,so doctor added a diuretic...BP still running around 160/97 so I will be asking her to try something else. This doesnt seem to be stabilizing it at all.",5,2,2
My blood pressure rises every time I received this particular generic manufactured pill.,3,1,1
"Lisinopril 10 MG controlled my blood pressure but made me tired, gave me headaches and made me dizzy at times.

I have more energy and am not tired all the time on new med.         ",5,2,4
Started taking 20MG of this 6 days ago. already my BP went from 150/115 to 122/91. I have noticed that I lose my breath fairly quickly now doing moderate activity and my heart beats alot faster since starting this drug. My resting heart beat is about 95bpm and when doing any kind of workout it gets above 200bpm. Happy with the lower BP but going to ask the Dr. to take me off of it.,5,3,5
it has lowered my moderate high blood pressure but I recently had nose bleeds,5,5,5

"BEWARE!  This drug put me in the ER...twice!!  The first time, I was experiencing severe upper-abdominal pain, which my physician assumed was my gall bladder.  After extensive testing at the hospital, it was decided that I had a 'virus.' (At this point, no connection to the Lisinopril as the cause had been made.)  The second time, three weeks later, I woke up with my throat and uvula so swollen that I could barely speak.  Off to the ER again where things finally started to improve after receiving high doses of depo-medrol (steroids) and benadryl through an IV.  It was then that the doctors concluded I was having severe allergic reactions to the Lisinopril!  I was taken off of it immediately and was back to normal within a week.  TAKE WITH CAUTION!!!  At the very least, you will likely develop the annoying dry/hacking cough, which is bad enough on its own and reason enough to skip this awful drug.",5,1,1
I have been getting hemoroids am wondering if this is a side effect but blood pressure has stabilized also get headaches,4,3,4
"i was in the ER for bp 223/127 and was given this drug to take home, I was back in the ER 5 days later as this drug reaked havoc on my system, my lips were on fire, I felt horrible and my BP was back to 212/116, am on other drugs now that work for me, scary",4,1,1

Within a week of starting this medication I noticed I was feeling very fatigued, having muscle cramps, and feeling lightheaded at times.  Today I could barely get up 2 sets of stairs!  I work out regularly and last night got dizzy in class and had no energy.  Maybe reducing the dosage would help - I am going to contact my doctor.  No issues with cough or nausea so far like others have mentioned, but I have definitely noticed some side effects.",5,2,3
"I took my first pill yesterday and I don't like the side effects already. I was so dizzy and light headed it scared me. Very lethargic.  I also had bad upset stomach, Dr. said try and recheck BP in 10 days. I am gonna take at night. I will continue to take and see what happens...",5,1,3

Then I started noticing that I was wheezing nightly about 45mins after taking. I always checked my bp while on med and it didn't lower enough to constitute continuing with the above side effects. Even went down to 10mg at bedtime, still same outcome. I also noticed shortly after I starting it, I would doze off shortly after eating.

For someone who has always had long & thick hair, this is not exactly the side effect that I want to experience. In the list of side effects, it lists hair loss as a rare side effect.

This might have been tolerable but when I would lay down to sleep - the coughing was so bad I would end up vomiting.  My stomach went into convulsions.  I continued to experience day time coughting even three weeks after discontinuing the use of this medication.  The pill is easy to swallow and is very inexpensive,1,1,2

"I have been this drug since August 2013. I have the worst dry and persistent cough, my skin is itchy and my feet are very dry. I was on Amlodipene before with Atenonolol, but when I was diagnosed with Diabetes, my doctor took me off the Amlodiopene and added the Lisonpril.

I'm going back to her because I need to stop coughinge and wetting my pants.",3,3,3

I've been taking this medicine a little over a year now and I've noticed a difference in my hair and my skin. My skin is EXTREMELY dry on my feet and hands. Also my hair has thinned and my texture changed. I often have odd pain in my arms when moving. It takes a lot of energy from me too. I'm really not a medicine user so it has to be this drug because I've never had these issues in the past  I'm taking 10mg for my bp caused by pkd but the long term effects of this drug are really starting to show.While it's lowered my bp a little I'm struggling with the issues its causing.,5,2,3
I am glad my doctor has put me on this medication. My blood pressure runs ungodly high and so far I can honestly tell a difference. I truly know when my blood pressure is out of sorts and that is a scary feeling for me.

"This medication caused me to have SEVERE fatigue and muscle pain.  Also, caused a dry cough.  Symptoms went away when I stopped the drug.  My doctor didn't believe it was the medicine causing my symptoms. So after 3 months of being in bed most of the day, I stopped on my own (against his advice) and was back to normal within a few days.  I then controlled my pre-hypertension with diet (low salt and lots of fruits/veggies).  It's been 4 years and I check my BP regularly and it stays within normal limits with diet and exercise.

At first I thought they were allergy related, but then figured out maybe it was the drug.  Called my doctor and they said to stop taking it.  It's been 2 weeks since I quit.  No more shortness of breath, but still having occasional coughing spells.  Hopefully they will go away soon.  Very irritating.",4,1,2

"For six months I suffered with a relentless cough, accompanied by weepy eyes and a waterfall of mucous. I had no idea that it was a side effect of the 10 mg of lisinopril that I took daily.  My doctor took me off this drug following a thyroidectomy last month.  The cough continued, except when I was in the hospital and a few days of convalescence at home. I couldn't figure out why I was cough-free for those few days until I needed to resume taking the prescribed pain reliever. I realized that the Tramadol HCL stopped the cough! I was stunned! This pain reliever is non-narcotic and non-addictive and easy on the stomach.   My doctor ordered a refill so that I could continue taking it for this horrendous cough.  I only need to take one pill in the morning and one at night, and I'm good to go.  On my next visit with him I will ask about the long-term effects of taking this drug as a cough suppressant.  Hopefully, this cough won't preempt my life indefinitely, but in the meantime I give thanks that I had that surgery when I did, and found some relief.  My heart goes out to all of you suffering from this affliction. Discuss options with your physician before  this insidious cough hijacks your life! ",4,1,5

I also have trouble swallowing. I believe this drug should be taken off the market or wouldn't be suprised if the FDA takes it off the market some time soon. I think the Family Medicine MDs and DOs are in denial on this drug. It works but the side effects seriously outweight the benefits.

I have been on it for several years, but my Dr & I need to chat about this as I cannot continue to feel like I am going to pass out when my BP 'bottoms out' like it has been doing!

Modified diet, lost 35 lbs. Walk/jog daily.  No longer taking plavix.  Cholestorel dropped from 240 to 140, other numbers improved considerably.

I see a neurologist for this.  I was concerned about the med. but began taking it 2 weeks ago.  First week I felt find, but this second week I am absolutely exhausted and have been having slight migrains.  I believe this exhaustion is due to the blood pressure medication and not the ALS.

After about 2 months I stoped taking the drug and a few days later my legs stoped hurting. My husband took this drug for a couple of years and almost cried his legs hurt so bad. We never knew the drug had this side effects untill after he died. I figured out what was causing my legs to hurt after I started taking this medcine. A friend of mine told me her legs had hurt for year or two and I told her my experience with this medcine she ask the doctor to take her off of it. He did and her legs got 95 percent better. This medcine will cause a big knot behind the knee also. This should be listed on the side effects but it is not. Doctors sometime will not beleive a person when they tell them about this medcine causing the legs to hurt. So far 3-4 people that I know of has proved it. Watch out for this side effect. You will hurt really bad in your legs.,4,1,1

"The side effects of this medicine are horrible.  Ive copy this from wikipedia on how the drug is made. An ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor) is a pharmaceutical drug used primarily for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and congestive heart failure.  Originally synthesized from compounds found in pit viper venom, ACE inhibitors inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (a component of the blood pressure-regulating renin-angiotensin system), thereby decreasing the tension of blood vessels and blood volume, thus lowering blood pressure.  Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril why would i want to take anything made from snake venom, however this explains the side effects.  They need to take this drug off the market.",1,1,2

Little did I know until today, that it is the Lisinopril making me cough!! The coughing has caused so much damaged to my body. It's a tremendous force and blow to my body every time I cough. Of all the cough complaints on all these forums and such, a warning label must be put on this medication that EVERY dr. cannot miss!! I have even cough until my bladder has came apart inside and broken a rib. I hate this medication and I am stopping it today.

Drinking water did not help however sucking on hard candy or chewing gum got the saliva glands going to alleviate cough and throat tickle. Lost a lot of sleep these last four years. Hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ (a diuretic) caused dry mouth, which contriubted to cough, and some cramping in the strangest places (jaw, scalp, back). I have been proactively working to get cholesterol within normal range and after doing extensive research, found out that HCTZ can also cause elevation in cholesterol by as much as 12%.

"This drug worked great at lowering my pressure but I could not take the cough , I tried everything to sooth the cough but it kept making me lose sleep , this drug is cheap and works if you can stand the coughing . I now switched to Losatan and the coughing stopped but not sure yet if it lowers the pressure as good as this one did . I now pay $80.00 a month vs the $4.00 this drug was . I wish I did not have to change because this drug really worked and other than coughing I had no other problems with it . Seems all these blood pressure meds have nasty side effects , I just hope that I found one now that doesn't , too soon to tell . I did find that when I coughed a lot lifesavers helped but who wants to be woken up all hours of the night and have to eat lifesavers ? ",5,1,4

It would start with a sharp pain in my throat (like a pin sticking ) then the tears would come--and the COUGH!!  It was truly the cough from H_ll. Couldn't sleep at night for it.  I think I kept Robitussin cough medicine stock up for a couple of months.  Nausea-horrible coughing!! When I read some of the reviews on this site, I stopped taking it immediately!!  I was so excited to know that I wasn't losing my mind or dying, I called my doctor's office that day and went in the next day.  My doctor didn't seem nearly as excited as I was about my discovery.

I have been taking Lisinopril for about 20yrs and have no side effects at all that I can contribute to its use.

I'm 27....I wish I never took lisiponril.  The side effects were to much.  I feel great now,  I feel brand new.  I feel young again.  Most importanly I feel healthly and no longer feel like I'm sick.  I feel great.  I'm glad I did the research about blood pressure medicines.  If it was not for that I would have never asked my Doctor to switch me to a Calicum Channel Blocker.  From what I hear though CCB work better in African American males anyway.

I needed to take 3-4 doses of Excedrin daily just to function. The coughing made it hard to sleep. My mouth and throat were constantly dry, which lead to drinking a lot of water, so bathroom visits also increased. I also felt lethargic - no motivation to do anything.  On the positive side, it did keep my blood pressure in check, averaging 117/74, which is the only reason I rated it three stars for effectiveness.

When I began taking it again I felt terrible, legs hurt, face and throat were flush. I felt as though something heavy was weighing me down. I also noticed joint pains which I had previously, but had disappeared once I stopped taking Lisinopril although I had not associated it.  I was only when I began taking it again that I thought the Lisinopril may be causing the pains and the cough is back.  I will have to change again I think.",5,2,3

"I cannot believe this drug is still on the market. Over 2000 comments here, about 90% complain of severe dry hacking cough.

I think the worst of it was when I called my cardiologist to report this and get some help, and I was told that this medicine doesn't cause the symptoms I was having.

Then my hands and back also developed a severe rash. After going to my doctor 3 times for the rash, I decided to get a second opinion. It was the lisinopril! they since changed my prescription, but the tissue damage from the rashes will take a long time to heal. oh, my 1st doctor blamed it on hormones then treated me for scabies. he is no longer my doctor!",5,2,5

My systolic blood pressure came down 30 mm after being placed on this drug and my diastolic pressure came down 20mm after being placed on this drug.  I feel so much better now.  Before being placed on this drug I used to feel little sharp acute pain in my chest but not anymore seen being placed on my bp med because my bp was to high.

Seems alright,4,4,4
"Have been on this several years, doc. recently doubled dose. Have suffered with sinus symtoms,post nasal drip, violent coughing, gagging, eyes and nose running. Several bouts a day, and also through the night. Doc. says its allergies, no help from several allergy meds. I have stopped taking and see some lessening of symptoms. Actually slept through two nights without the usual several coughing FITS.. I am monitoring my BP and have seen no increase since going off the stuff!! My coughing episodes are enough to cause a Stroke... I don't plan to take any more.",5,1,3
I have been taking this medication for the last 6 months and it is GREAT! I had a little annoying coughand it lasted about 1 month and now it is gone. I highly recommend this drug!,5,5,5
lowers bp but the chronic dry cough (which appreared only after 6 months of use) is disruptive and annoying.  I am done with this!,5,2,3
No side effects at all and I feel great!,5,5,4
"Starting having headaches so bad it was hard to go to sleep.(I take med at bedtime) I couldn't figure out why, and by process of elimination, I figured out its this medication. I won't be taking this anymore.",4,1,2
At 10mg/daily it reduced systolic 15pts. and diastolic 10 pts.  No side effects.  I was out of it for the first two weeks of use.,5,5,5
" I took one 10mg pill AT 9 AM BP WAS 170/105By 4pm my bp had dropped to92/60  felt like i was dying.headacks loss of energy.upset stomack ,and i feel like im in a daze. Have not taken drug in four days and my bp is 120/75  will never take again",5,1,5
"I was recently diagnosed with hypertension and this drug was prescribed. I was very pleased with the fact that I paid less than two dollars for a ninety day supply. It also reduced my blood pressure, but the side effect of coughing was too much for me so I reluctanly had to switch to another medication. If I didn't have coughing fits for hours I would have remained on this medication. Thank you",5,2,4
"my bp has been trending higher the last few years so when it checked 146/92, my dr again suggested treatment and i finally agreed after refusing for about 2 years. because when i check my bp at home it was usually lower, but often still in pre high range 130/80s. I eat good and exercice often and I am afraid of how dangerous high bp can be. Taking drug for 1 week and my bp close to normal, no side effects. 10mg. ",5,5,5
"Been taking it for 2 years, 20mg but doctor recently reduced it to 5mg.  Still effective and no side effects at all. ",5,5,5
Cannot tell if it has made any difference after heart stent.,4,3,3
woke up and my lips were swellen,5,5,5
My first time ever being on any medication on a daily basis.  My age is 53. I've been on medication for 3 months.  All of a sudden I have a continuous cough. May have to change med. Seems to keep BP in reasonable range.,5,4,4
This medication does not work alone I take 2 other medications to control my blood pressure.,5,3,3
"prescribed to ""protect "" my kidneys/ just want to learn more about it.",1,1,1
not a problem until I developed the cough. My doctor took me off it and put me on another prescription and no cough. Had to increase dosage but works fine now,5,3,5
This medication does not control my high blood pressure. My pressure still stay in the range of 130-150 and I take my medciation each and every day along with a water pill but my blood pressure still has not gotten better. Along with my pressure still not being good this medication makes me cough all the time. I hate it and when I see my doctor she will be taking me off of this because she was thinking that I had lung cancer or something. The coughing was so bad that she was sending me to get CT scan and xrays done of my chest and they found nothing. My mother has been coughing like this for almost 10 years and come to find out she takes the exact same medication for high blood as I do. I will no longer be taking this medication in about a week.,3,1,2
"Just started taking this med only about a month ago. It has worked wonders on my blood pressure!! It's perfect and I'm a diabetic. I still get some periods of dizziness, a little nausea, and my head feels funny sometimes. I can feel it working. Not sure if this is related or not, but I have been having heart palpitations,will tell my dr about that.  Overall, it looks like a wonder drug. I have to say, I see a lot of people wrote about this chronic coughing as a side effect. Honestly, I think, only the very first two days I had a little dry cough, but since then I have NO coughing at all!  This is a wonder drug if you are looking for one! Overall, very happy",5,4,5
i have to write a review on this medicine. I do not take it but my husband did. He is a truck driver and he developed a terrible cough that it got to be to dangerous for him to drive. His coughs got so bad that he was on the brink of passing out sometimes. So he had to get off of it a week ago still has cough but not as bad hopefully it goes away real soon. This is a dangerous drug for anyone that drives or uses machinery for a living. ,2,1,2
"I give only 3 stars for satisfaction because of the horrible cough I have to deal with.  The coughing racks my entire body, sore ribs, back and at time I feel as I will pass out.  Mr. Dr. said it was from post nasal drip, took various meds and cough syrups but nothing helps.  I cannot tolerate this drug because of the cough.  I sound like someone who smokes 5 packs a day.  If I'm out in public I have to leave the room.",5,3,4
"Dry cough is persistent and annoying. I have soreness in my chest, but overall it seems to work well",4,3,4
"I have taken this med for about 3 months and it has done wonders for my BP.  My BP was 235/115 and it is now 135/85.  At first I was on 20 mg and am now on 40 mg.  At first I had dizzyness, diarrhea and lightheadedness, but those have gone away.  I still have the cough which makes me gag sometimes, but that is the only side effect I have left.  I asked the dr if there was anything I could do about that and he said no.  I thought the longer I took the med, that the cough would go away as well.  I would recommend this med to anyone with high BP.  It has brought down my BP 100 points on top and 30 points on the bottom.  No other BP med has ever done what this drug has done for me.",5,3,5
Gave me severe indigestion & Heartburn,5,1,3
"numerous side effects dizzyness,",5,1,2
At first I did  have a dry cough but that went away in about a month.  The cough was not bad enough to make me stop the medication.  The best part is that I have experianced NO sexual side effects and that is great.  My wife and I have a great relationship and didn't want medication interfering with it.,5,5,4
blood pressure still elevate sometimes ,4,3,3
"i started with 2.5mg in 1995 then it increased to 5mg in 2001 and 10mg in 2007 finally doctor suggested me to change medicine, it has no side effect but it really never kept my bp in 120/80 range,it has remained 150~160/85~100 and lately it was above 100, partly i can blame my less sleep and over work and smoking (4-5 cig a day)",4,3,2
/took this for 1 month and briught my blood pressure down to normal,4,4,4
I have used it for year at least and I still high days.,4,1,2
it was prescribed for hypertension. ive been using it over two months and have had no changed to my blood pressure. i've followed dietary changes and lifestyle changes to no effect,5,1,1
Was unaware I had high blood pressure until I had a routine exam.  I hadn't been to the doctor in 5 years and am in great health.  My BP was 160/110! Felt immediate relief with the first dosage (10 mg 1x daily).  No side effects and feel great!,5,5,5

developed cough and bad sinus infection  lasting more than 4 months.  dr. denied lisinopril could be cause.  after talking to other users I stopped lisinopril and am slowing recovering.  ,4,1,4
"My mother had been using lisinopril for years with no problems, until last week.  She developed an allergic reaction to the drug.  She was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  Emergency room physicians made my mother and I aware that allergic reactions to this drug is common among black americans.  My mother's tongue was so swollen that she could not talk.  It was horrifying.  She called me a work to let me know what was happening. I could not understand her on the phone.  It's a blessing that she was able to get to the hospital in time for to begin an IV of benadryl. She was transferred to ICU to receive monitoring.  She was unable to drink or eat. She was in the hospital for two days.  Her medication was been changed.  I'm taking lisinopril too, but I will be contacting my doctor to change my medication asap. I strongly advise anyone taking this medication to think twice about taking it, because you never know if you will develop an allergic reaction. ",3,1,3
I started taking this about 2 weeks ago.  Doctor started me on 5 mg but my blood pressure went too low.  I now take 2.5 mg and no problems with side effects and bp stays good.  The dose is so low I may not feel any sie effects.,5,5,5
The side effects of extreme dizziness and light headedness were baffling.   I felt as if I was on a powerful drug and had no choice.  My quality of life diminished.  I hated the feeling of loss of control in my life.  ,1,1,2
blood pressure remains hogh,5,2,3
I have endured a lot of illnesses and injuries in my life but none of them were as bad as the constant migraine headache that this drug has given me over the past five days!!!  As I sit here writing I feel as though I am getting hit in the head with a brick.,5,1,2

"I've taken lisinopril for a number of years and about a year ago, it seemed that it was no longer effective.  My blood pressure was staying high.  I quit taking it, and have discovered that the cough I had, the tiredness and exhaustion and dizziness that all had been attributed to allergies, is now gone and I have more energy than I have ever had.  I cannot believe I've lived with this for so many years when I could have gotten rid of all the ""allergy"" symptoms by discontinuing use of lisinopril!",3,2,3
I was put on Lisinopril 20 mg a little over a year ago. I love it! No complaints. It may work so well because I'm young. Even being healthy didn't get me away from genetics. ,5,5,5

"I took lisinopril for less than 6 mo; it gave a dry hacking cough and was completely ineffective for high BP. My doctor thought I had COPD, but the cough went away within 1 week after I stopped taking lisinopril. I have taken many meds for BP over the past 30 yrs, this was the worst!",4,1,1

"Been on this med for 2 months and am starting to experience anxiety and knee pain, and have had dizzy spells since I started.  When I bend over, as soon as I stand up I become very dizzy.  I am continually tired.  Overall it's done wonders for my blood pressure, but the side effects are questionable as whether I can tolerate them.    ",5,2,5
"Extreme itching, hand pain esp. right hand, extreme left calf throbing pain like that of a nerve conduction test, headache, sinus pain in face, bad pain in kidneys, bone aching severe, feelings of ""dumb"" and detachment from reality, took the Lisinopril 40 mg tab for about two months suffering began within a week but could not figure out what was causing it as thoughts were eratic and ""dumb"" feeling, stopped taking pill by self for the past three weeks feeling better had a physical, sugar level increase, blood pressure increase, measuring blood pressure at home to give to doctor, I would not - ever recommend this medication for anyone.

"Taking this pill has brought my BP down to 125-130 levels but for the last 3 months I've been having headaches. Unusual because my head throbs painfully only when I cough, clear my throat or sneeze. Also this happens only when I am upright. If I cough when laying down, no pain. Any body else going through this?",5,2,3
I coughed day and night,5,1,1
"I took it for a while with no problems, got a kidney transplant and didn't need it anymore.  Once I lost the transplant and went back on it my tongue swelled up.  However, it was only half my tongue, one side swelled up so huge I couldn't talk and had to go to the er and get a shot. I can't take this anymore.",5,1,5
"After taking for a year, I noticed that I had a very dry cough. One morning, after taking my dose of 10mg, my tongue started swelling. I had to go to the ER where they changed my prescription.

"I'm 32yo and have recently been diagnosed with hypertension.  It runs heavily in my family for those family members that are obese.  I am active, fit and a healthy eater.  My doctor checked my kidney function levels prior to starting the Lisinopril HCTZ and they were normal.  Then my 2wk bloodwork after taking the med showed extreme high kidney levels but my blood pressure is great.  So my doc changed my prescription without the diaretic (HCTZ) and see how it works and do bloodwork in 2 wks.  I would advise everyone on any blood pressure med to make sure your doctor is checking your kidney functions.",4,2,4
"Since on this for 2 weeks blood pressure went from 190/? coupled with severe migraines and swelling, to below the nromal range.  I feel better, not taking ibuprofen for pain and swelling.

"I was given this medications for high blood pressure and took it for 2 weeks. I began to have intense cravings for salt and spicy food. I also severe from depression and take an antidepressant for it. Over the two weeks I was on the medication, I became more and more depressed. It got to the point where I couldn't control my emotions. My tears were unstoppable. My doctor told me to stop taking the medication nd he switched me to a calcium channel blocker and increased my antidepressant. I researched more the connection between diuretics, salt cravings, and depression and discovered the diuretic in Lisinopril was ridding my body of salt; hence, my intense salt craving. I also discovered that salt is considered the body's natural anti-depressant which explains my deterioration in mood. Also, discovered that intense salt cravings means that you are probably deficient in sodium and low blood sodium levels can be fatal so if you have intense salt cravings you should give your body what it wants and have your blood sodium levels checked. I would not recommend this medication to any that suffers from depression. I went completely haywire and couldn't make through any day at work this week. I am starting to feel better. I am excited about the Calcium channel blocker because it helps prevent chest pain which has been my major complaint. My blood pressure hovers a little over 140/90 with the 2nd number being the highest. I didn't notice significant drops in blood pressure with Lisinopril which could be because of the extra salt I was adding. I did notice some weight loss while on lisinopril that made me happy. I will miss the weight loss but it is not worth running around like a crazy salt addict crying uncontrobly. Depression isn't a recognized side effect of Lisinopril but it should be. ",1,1,2
blood sugar levels have dropped from high 300's to 150 or less since I started taking this drug with insulin.dont understand why.havent chaged anything else.i guess it is working.,5,5,5

"Wow, I am surprised, I came to research this medication becasue of the extreme pain, fatigue and hand pain, dumbness. I cannot believe all the others that experience the same exact thing. I had no idea. I have been taking this medication for over 5 years, the dr. has just recently doubled by dsg to 80 mgs 2x a day. No wonder I feel so awful. Thanx people out there without your feedback I would have never guessed that it was the side effect of this medicine. I can hardly use my right hand. I cant believe this. I take 80 mgs of lisinipril, .4 mg of Clonidine, and 100 mg of Metropolol, daily.",3,3,3
caused serious dozziness,5,1,2
"As I sit and write this I have intervals of coughing and gagging.  At first I thought I was getting a cold, blew my nose all the time and had post nasal drip which caused the coughing.  I never got a cold and the coughing continues. I have given this about 6 weeks so I'm going in next week and see if I can try something else.  I am tired of not knowing when I am going to have a ""coughing attack"" and I am sucking on throat lozenges all the time.  I hope this all clears up when I switch to something else. BP has been ""ok"" but I have had some times where it has spiked up but if everyone took their BP as much as I do, maybe everyone spikes throughout the day, especially during the elections or thinking of the many stresses of our lives.",5,2,3

I did have the dry cough when I started taking Lisinopril but that only lasted for about 2wks.  I have had no problems at all after that first 2wks. I had been taking atenolol 50mg and did not like it at all compared to Lisinopril.  Lisinopril does not have the instant rebound effect that atenolol has if you forget a dose. And did not cause any of the racing heart beat effect that atenolol would give to me.,4,5,5

"for 15 months my lisonpril dose was 5 mg and my blood pressure was constant at 125/65 (average per day per month). After Aortic Valve Relacement and Aortic Anuerysm repair, 4 months ago,  my dose is now 40 mg and my blood pressure range is all over the spectrum. The dosage increase has been incremental but doesn't seem to be treating the condition. This counter intuitive to me - get fixed and need 8 times the dose yet it hasn't corrected the symptom.",5,2,2

"I have been on Lisinopril (10 mg daily) for about 10 years. It has left me with a terrible cough, constant dry mouth, fatigue, depression, leg cramps, abdominal pain, headaches,  and neck pain.  It did lower blood pressure, for the most part, but I still got tightness and pain in chest and upper back making it hard to breathe from time to time (they doubled the dosage). The side effects ARE NOT worth it! My overall health has severely declined since being on this medication.  I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Asthma, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sjogren's Syndrome (dry mouth), and have gained about 100 lbs.  Doctors were treating me for so many other things, instead of just changing the medication, with the known side effects, but I guess that's how they make their money. I am no longer taking it.  I just hope it doesn't have lasting side effects, and I can get on with my life and be happier & healthier, now.",5,2,3

"I have been on this medication for a year. I have had severe side effects that the doctor says could not be the medication. I finally went to a heart specialist. It was determined I was over medicated. I started  taking 50mg. I had all of the severe side effects and more! I have been in the hospital twice this year. The last time was not a heart attack... it was a panic attack caused from blood pressure dropping to 80/34. I am now taking 2,5mg about every other day and it still drops to 90/54 in the evenings! I fight panic attack from the medication. I feel weak, dizzy and faint most of the time. I want to feel good again!",1,1,4

Azor effective, softer tinnitus, but zone-out in evening, bad sinus/ear infections, testosterone low, PSA up, some hair loss.  Diovan worse than lisinopril. IS there a solution without the grief?",5,3,4

"I have tried this drug before and all I do is cough, cough, and cough after two days worth.  It did lower my bp better than Benicar but the coughing is now causing asthma attacks, chest pain from the coughing and lack of sleep for myself and my husband.  The side effect of that alone is not worth it. ",1,1,3

My left foot started swelling in June and then my thigh in my left leg right above my knee has swollen. I had SEVERE pain in my knees caused by the Coreg and the pain is gone but my left leg is swollen still. Every since I started this lisinopril I have had my asthma flare up, and it rarily bothers me. I feel my chest in my bhroncial area tighten up and I cough until I use my inhaler. I am reading all of these others side effects to this drug. It's pretty scarey & my left calf is starting to swell too. Is any one else out there having trouble with just one leg swelling? I had tests ran & it's not my heart. Please email me at [email protected] if you have had these side effects.",3,3,4

I experienced seasonal allergy feelings, dry cough, heartburn, indigestion, acid reflex, urine frequency increased and then the stomach pains started.  Once that started then the urgency and frequency for bowel movements also increased.  The pain then started in my lower back and got more intense in my lower stomach.  It also felt like I had a urinary tract infection.  The pain kept getting worse.  This is the second time I was on this medication and I had the same effects both times after a few months of being on this. Won't take this medication again.",5,3,3

The day after the surgery I noticed my chest was red and hot to the touch, like a sunburn. As time went on I started peeling everywhere (even the palms of my hands and fingertips), some burning on my skin and itching. Could this be caused by this medication.? I can't afford to go to a dermatologists, I have no insurance.",3,3,3
"I have a persistent cough, feeling in my chest of heaviness and blurred vision.",5,1,1

I have been on this medication for around 2 years and had a severe allergic reaction. It was severe enough that I had to go to the hospital because of my tongue & throat swelled and I was unable to swollow & had trouble breathing. After reading all about the medication I believe I should not have been put on it as I have COPD a severe breathing problem that should have been taken into consideration before prescribing this medication to me.,5,1,5

I seem to have more energy, but the cough I have developed is very annoying and has me very concerned, because of constant chest pains, and when you have been diagnosed with cancer right away I am thinking the worse....these reviews has eased my mind quite a bit, Thank You... I am going back in to see my cancer Dr, just to make sure and then  follow up with my regular Dr. I rather this med than the Antenol. ",4,3,4

After a major stroke I made serious lifestyle changes.  When diet and exercise failed to lower BP enough the Dr. advised 10 mg daily. BP is under control.  I have had intermittant dry cough.  I drink at least 80oz water daily and this helps keep me hydrated and avoiding muscle cramps. ,5,5,5
"The cough.  Good golly, the cough I could NOT get rid of till I quit this med.  And I miss it because I think it was helping to curb my appetite.  I tried to take 1 lisinopril after being switched to Norvasc and the cough was back that very nite.  Now I'm on Norvasc and it seems to be working but I never take my b.p. and my appetite is coming back which is bad, I've gained weight fast.  Can't these companies make a drug that doesn't have side effects???",5,2,4

"When taking this medication (2.5mg)I have acquired extremely bad upper back burning sensation with pain and tranferring to center part of chest. The burning sensation in chest feels like a heart attack. I complained to my Cardiologist and was told to keep using it and as in fact, was told to use twice a day. I finally stopped using it and 3 days after I stopped, the pain dissappeared. For me personally, the cons outweighed the benefits. I wish everyone luck with this medication but for me it had very little to no effect.",2,1,2

"I was taken off Chlorthalidone, a diuretic because of a slight drop in my postassimum and sodium levels and put on Lisinopril. I am on some mdications that cause some bladder constipation and the Chlorthalidone took care of that problem completely. I could finally urinate completely. I also lost pounds of water weight.  When the doctor called about the potassium levels, which were not bad at all, but she said why deal with it all if we don't have to? I stopped the Chlorthalidone and began the Lisinopril. Within one day I couldn't urinate, I had leg cramps that frightened me and felt totally out of it and dizzy. I didn't suffer from a cough, but that is because I stopped the drug, went back on the Chlor.(which had gotten my B.P under control)and began taking supplements and eating bananas.  I feel fine after a week back on the 1st medication and now have to call my Dr. to tell her what I have done. However, no matter *what* she says I will NOT go back on Lisinopril.",4,1,3

"I have been on this medication for 6 weeks now at 10 mg. I have found that I have increased anxiety, rapid heart rate and trouble sleeping.

I am sensitive to medications and have been for the last 10 yrs. I have tried talking with my doctor about lowering the dosage, but with no success as of yet. I feel that my blood pressure problems are largely due to my hypothyroidism not being treated as it should be. I had no problems for 6 yrs when on a different thyroid medication. But its frustrating to get the doctors now days to listen to their patient, we know our bodies better than they do. But unfortunately doctors today are all about the lab results, and treating only the symptoms then they are about listening to their patients and finding out the actual cause of the problem. And for that, many of us suffer needlessly and are over medicated.   ",3,1,4

I think all meds have some side effects and I hate to take anything.",5,3,3

"although my pressure did lower within a week, I had an uncontrollable dry cough that kept me awake ALL NIGHT! I will never take this medication again!",2,1,3

It seems to be working on most days to keep my blood pressure down. ,5,4,4

"After taking 5 mg for over 15 years, I developed severe angioedema two weeks ago on 6/16/10.The emergency room doctor took one look at me and asked if I was taking Lisinopril. My face, lips, and throat were swelling up and it was difficult to breathe. I happened to be in a hospital lobby when it happened and a code blue was announced.I was informed this drug can cause these symptoms the first time you take it or after 20 to 30 years. I dealt with the dry cough all these years since the drug lowered my BP at low doses. I'm still recovering two weeks.  ",4,1,4
I take lisnopril and amlodipine for my BP.  I have been taking both of them for over 2 years and experienced some light headness plus several anxiety attacks.  I stopped taking the medicine when I developed swollen lips eyes and a rash.  My DR took me off the med immediately and I think my tolerance for this medication is now very low.  I would suggest everyone have their DR. go over the side effects of the meds they take periodically.  Lastly I was thinking I had a reaction to Mangoes when my lips swelled up but Dr. said he had seen patient in the past with this reaction from the medication,4,2,3
"The cough is like an uncontrollable spasm, much worse at night. Also my eyes water and am experiencing post-nasal drip. 6 days on this medication and above side effects are increasing, including impaired sleep due to chronic coughing. Will contact physician when daylight arrives!",5,1,4

"I started on the Lisinopril about about 5 months ago.  I knew one of the side effects would be coughing but it stated it should subside after the body become use to the meds.  Well 5 months later the cough was very light and now it has turned into a very harsh, strong and disruptive dry cough.  This cough causes others to have concern because of the severeness at times.  It disrupts my sleep every single night and can be painful to the stomach it is such a powerful type of cough.  I get no sleep with this med.  I will be seeking out another med because it is taking my pressure down but bringing it back up with the stress of not sleeping and all the coughing.",3,1,3

"my blood pressure was slightly elevated,lisinopril has kept it in a safe range for about one year",3,3,3
"maximum 40mg dose only slightly effective, then combined with norvasc did better. i never developed the dreaded cough. important to stay hydrated.  diuretics are not worth the other health effects caused by dehydration",5,4,3
I have been on this med for over 4 yrs and had no side affects. Tried several other types and found this one to be the best for me.,5,5,5

"This particular blood pressure medication is generic under my prescription plan, and it works just as well as the name brand, for me anyway.  My husband was on it also, but it made him cough, which could be one of the side-effects.  So my doctor put him on another brand.",5,5,5
My dr. prescribed me the 5mg Lisinopril for high blood pressure.  It did lower my blood pressure however I experience panic and worrying for no reason and I have been coughing severly to the point I can not catch my breath.  I emailed my doctor and she took me off of it right away.,4,2,3

I also noticed itchy scalp at the beginning, which also seems to be ok now.  My main issue is complete numbness in my left arm and leg during the night. Hopefully it will go away soon.

"Drug has horrible side effects - if you feel weak, tired, anxious, nervous, panic attacks, I suspect its Lisinop especially from all the posts on this website.

In the past few (6?) months, I have noticed  that my lips and tongue have been sore. I have changed toothpaste with no real change. For the past week my lips have been swollen and are now blistering. I thought it was from something I ate, but can think of nothing I have been allergic to in the past that could have bothered me. I'm thinking it is the Lisinopril. Does anyone have a similar experience? Please let me know",4,2,4
I really don't like the cough with this drug and its all day every day.,2,2,3

I am 73 years old male in excellent health and my hair never experienced such a detrimental condition. I am partially bald and I am worrying about this problem.  I also take Lipitor to control cholesterol, and Co Q-10 200 MG to suppress the muscle pain Lipitor has caused.   Please advice",4,3,4
"Immediately experienced lightheadedness. Became extremely tired and had to lay down for several hours. I stopped taking them and began feeling like my head would explode. My blood pressure went up to stroke levels. I began taking lisinopril again. My blood pressure went down but I began having a dry cough,exaustion, racing heart beat and panic attacks. What's worse, my throat became swollen and sore. Turning my head was difficult as a result of the swelling. Fearing that I may have cancer, I went to the emergency room; They were unmoved by my pain. I was told that it was more than likely, my lymph nodes and sent me on my way. I decided to check Web.MD and found that there were thousands of people who have had the same experience with this medication that I had! Some people can use this drug, I suppose, because some have sung it's praises. But if your first reaction to Lisinopril is not a good one. Call your Doctor!",5,2,4

I've been taking the lisinopril now for 2 months.  My heart palpitations are to a minimal finally!  I love this medication but the coughing and the horseness in my voice has become so annoying.  So I am now going to try micardis 40 mg once a day.  I just read the reviews on this drug and hope I dont experience the side effects other people have had.  I walk everday and have lost weight and feel great! I guess I will compare the two and if I have to put up with the cough instead of fatigue and back pain-then I may switch back.  ,5,3,4

"I recently added lisinopril to my other meds, (Multaq and Diltiazem HCL ER), and I am having terrible muscle cramps all over my body.  Any body else have multiple muscle spasms with this drug?  Maybe it's the other drugs complicating things.",5,3,3
"The side effects are not quite as bad after getting use to the drug; blurred vision, fatigue and lightheadedness upon standing.  I would like to get off this drug.  But, am not sure if there are side effects to quitting.  However, I have found a cosmetic side effect.  Ladies if you hightlight your hair blond, have well water and night sweats, your hair will turn copper red.  I have to strip my hair every 3-4 weeks at the hairdresser.  This didn't start until being on the drug for about 4 to 5 months. My hair looks stained red just where it touchs the nape of my neck and ears.  Anyone else experience this?",4,3,4

I have only been taking it 2 wks.  But it has changed my life.  My BP is finally normal and I can function again.  I have lost 11 lbs. and have no side effects other than the dizziness I experienced the first week.  I am surprised so many of you weren't aware of the possible cough.  That was the first thing my Dr. told me that a cough was a very common side effect.  I so far have not gotten one.,5,4,5

After reading theses blogs, I will try something else. I am a phone operator and this coughing does not help with my job!",5,1,3
"Terrible side efects. Prescribed after a stroke. Why any doctor would precribe a drug that can cause anxiety, swelling of the throat and tongue, fatigue muscle aches and panic attacks I will never know.

"Chronic Cough , very annoying ! Found similar complaints here . Will stop med today and see doctor soon . I also feel tired and have some dizziness . ",5,2,2
"What a relief to read other comments about this medication on here today!  While it has been EXCELLENT at lowering my blood pressure quickly, I've been attributing all the other side effects to allergies including:  persistent cough, watery eyes, runny nose.  But there's also been serious diarrhea, tiredness and 'growling' stomach.  I'm going to as for a change next time I visit my doctor in a few weeks.  Thanks for all the objective reviews on here for the 'wake-up' call!!",5,2,5

The dr immediately told me i had angioedema. This can lead to an airway obstruction. Luckily, I decided to go seek medical assistance. I can no longer take lisinopril. Be aware that this too can happen to you. Today, I am on steroids, benadryl, and pepcid. I feel fine overall just be aware that if you suddenly swell in the throat, face, lips, or tongue that you could be in big trouble. This also explains a big scare 6 months ago when out of the country and my throat swelled 5x its size both inside and out. Know the risks and act immediately. It could save your life. I was told by the DR that you can take lisinopril for years w/o any side affects then all of a sudden it turns on you.",4,3,4

"Was quite satisfied at first -- BP down, no serious side effects UNTIL I developed the dry, tickling cough which is pretty much 24/7!  The coughing doesn't stop the tickle, which can rapidly progress to uncontrollable coughs, gagging & tearing eyes.  The ONLY thing that helps is a constant ingestion of menthol cough drops along with a CARBONATED drink.  Water or non-carbonated drinks don't stop the tickle, but the bubbles seem to ""scratch it""!

"I've been taking this drug for years in combination with other meds. for my very labile hypertension. For some reason the other day I had a reaction which caused a life threatening episode. My tongue swelled it's called ANGIOEDEMA(also my feet were itching like crazy).I wound up in the emergency room and every medical personnel asked me if I was taking Lisinopril.I was told even though I had never had a reaction it can happen at anytime and that my recent prescription (2 days before) for prilosec was not the cause. In any case, as far as I'm concerned Lisinopril is a very dangerous medication. None of the pharmacy information lists this side effect.It is just listed with many other meds. that MAY require additional monitering. I think angioedema should be listed as a definite side effect.",4,4,3
"i've been having swelling of my face,lightheadedness/dry cough",3,1,3
"I had a chronic cough that would not go away.  My doctor said Lisinopril is notorious for cough producing, so he took me off it and put me on another drug.  The cough has gone away.",5,2,3
I have been on this since Oct 2009 when I went to the hospital my BP was 220/124 so at first everything was fine I now have a horrible dry cough/tickle in my throat. It is bad because I also have a bad back with a buldging disc so the coughing hurts. It does not stay but when I do get the cough I cannot sleep wake up all night May have to try something else although it has worked for my blood pressure.,5,3,4

"Took Lisinopril for a year or so and just totally suffered on and off.  Dizziness, can't walk well without holding on to something, severe coughing and blurred vision that is only suppose to be temporary.   Two doctors failed to acknowledge that it was the medicine so I decided to make the decision to quit taking it after searching for better results on other medicines.  Most people seem to think Cozaar works well with very little side effects for some.  I've been on it for a week and the severe dizziness is going away and I feel so happy and relieved.   But I get a slight achy feeling in my knees/joints which I can tolerate if that is one of the side effects and some people are experiencing this problem as I see in the reviews on here.  I can handle it as long as that feeling is going to be very mild and it beats the heck out of not being able to walk well and feeling so lousy every single day because your so dizzy.  Not sure if everyone has this problem but when I first take a new BP medicine and too high of a dose, my BP will actually go up for a few weeks.  I had it go up so high, I think the strokes I had was from the medicine and too high of a dose.  The doctor in the ER mentioned that this can happen.  They never found out that I had 8 strokes until weeks or a month later after an MRI.  The neroulogist showed me the scan.  I swear a volunteer doctor I had gave me too high of a dose and that is what happened.  Luckily I got better but it took almost a year, lots of exercise, very low salt, small portions of food and plenty of water to get better.  ",2,1,2

My husband was on this drug for his  heart and he complained of his legs hurting so very bad. The doctors never realized this drug was causing his legs to hurt.

Keep being told no difference between generic & brand name, but I believe there is something in the filler/binder the manufacturer (TEVA) uses since I am on 2 other medications from the same manufacturer (TEVA) and also have side effects, but the side effect is tolerable.

These few reviews each said they divided the 40 mgs into two 20mgs doses, one taken in am, the other in pm.  I tried, it worked!! Don't give up, this medication is the only one that works on my bp.

A week after I started taking this drug I experience a cough, sinus drainage, and sore throat.  I also experience a little insomia.  This went on for about 2 weeks, so I started drinking a lot of water with this medicine.

"I have been on this drug (10mg) for about two 1/2 weeks.  I have had this dry scratchy cough, and feeling the need to clear my throat often especially during the night.  I did not realize it could be a side effect until I saw all the people doing reviews talking about the same type of cough.  The first week I felt queasy, foggy.  I have noticed some additional blurring of vision, but not sure if that is due to the drug. It has lowered my blood pressure a bit.",4,4,4

"Nasty smoker's cough to the point of a deep dry heave. I guess the more affordable the medication the more misery you must go through. While this medication may work the miserable chronic cough it produces makes this product unacceptable and with so many other options out there it surprises me doctors push this one for there patients. Maybe they need to be required to try these medications before prescribing them so they will learn first hand how horrible the cost of benefits penality is taking these blood pressure medications. Avoid Lisinopril- again it may work but when coughing your head off regularly day after day it gets old fast. Too- getting dirty looks in public by women with children that you are a sick puppy and belong indoors and not outdoors thinking you may be making there children become sick since you appear so. A coughing mouth mask should come with this product upon purchase. Sincerely, W.S.",5,1,4

Symptoms of uncontollable dry cough showed up after I had a bout of bronchitis, and got progressively worse each day.  I finally went back to my Dr thinking I still had bronchitis, but was diagnosed as simply having allergic reaction to the drug, so she had me taking allergy pills to alleviate symptoms.  I had to swtich back to Diovan. ",4,1,4

"I had stage 2 hypertension, 10mg of lisinopril daily has brought that down to 120/80.  Before trying lisiniopril I was on a vasodialator and experienced some of the symptoms reported here by other people on lisinopril, ie:dry cough, migrain, body ache.

This lowers my blood pressure but after taking it for 6 months with coreg i started having extreme reactions to the coreg so my doctor put me on the lisinopril twice daily.

"I'm a 44 yr old male and was prescribed Lisonipril for high blood psi prevention. I do not have high BP currently. The first month I developed what I thought was a cold. Headache, bad cough,weezing lots of mucus. It was bad enough to get anti biotics from my doctor. The cold symtoms never got better, I saw a allergist and had all test done for every allergy. He gave me a breathing machine to take home as my lungs were full and I could not breath correctly. Night time was the worst, coughing started once I layed down, sometimes choking on the mucus. I noticed my sex drive was way down, I have always had a very healthy sex drive and this was distressing. I was always tired, depressed, irritable. My hair began to get dried out and dead feeling, I thought it was my shampoo or something. My mouth was so dry I began carrying a water bottle around with me. I have rashes on both legs that itch severely. I remember saying to my wife, I feel really sick, like all around bad. Something is wrong. I never get colds, I have perfect numbers cholest is 166. I know when something is wrong. I ran out of pills before the weekend and did not take any for 4 days. I began to feel less sick and could breath. I took my first pill in the 4 days and that night was feeling ill again. I looked up side effects that night and was shocked. I trusted my doctor, never thought this little pill was responsible for all this pain. 3 months of lost productivity. It been just one day off the pills, I can only hope I return to normal.",1,1,1
"Shortly after initiating treatment with this drug, I developed the ""chronic dry cough"" everyone talks about.  It has somewhat lessened over time but is still there.  After taking 10mg/day (doc had actually prescribed 40 mg!) for 5 months I developed Interstitial Cystitis (painful bladder disease) due to bladder irritation from the drug.  This is extremely painful and hard to resolve.  I would not recommend this drug for anyone having previous bladder sensitivity problems.        At the same time of being diagnosed with hypertension, I was also found to be hypothyroid.  The thyroid medication has brought down the B.P. to a much greater degree than the lisinopril.        My recommendation to anyone with high blood pressure or high cholesterol - rule out thyroid problems first before taking medications that may result in adverse side effects!!     ",4,2,4

Currently I take it about every other night.  I take it at night so when my bp is below 90/60 I'm asleep and it doesn't matter.  I have trouble functioning when it drops below this.  Had colonoscopy and my blood pressure went dangerously low.  If someone is having problems I recommend they double check with doctor before taking dose when anesthesia will be involved.

Very bad raspy to lose voice, severe stomach pain, bloating, and gas, initial dizziness that went away, and congestion/lots of phlegm.  Used to take 1st thing in AM & switched to before bed. This drug helped drop my BP but lots of issues with it.  Will see doc to soon to change med. Otherwise healthy person that now has severe gastro issues, creeping up potassium levels, cholesterol and sugar after taking Lisinopril HCI.

They have seen this reaction many times before from people who have taken it for a long time, and even after they have quit. He was admitted to Critical Care Unit overnight.  Very jarring experience as he's never had ANYTHING like that before. The med has been discontinued and he will need to get another one to help the diltiazen keep the BP down.

I am an 89 year old male...I seem to be loosing my voice since I began taking this medication.  At first I thought it was my thyroid (synthroid) medicine that was causing this because it has in the past but when I increased the thyroid medicine I still kept loosing my voice.  I quit taking the lisinopril and my voice became strong again and not shaky...I began again and there went my voice.  Have any of you had similar problems?,2,2,3

I would have liked to give a no star for satisfaction however.  I developed all the side effects after several months until I truly felt I would rather die of a heart attack than feel the way I felt on this drug.  I quit taking it on my own.  I feel a little better, but if my vision problems that developed because of it don't soon reverse, I will be extremely unhappy, more than I am now. ",1,1,1
"I took this medication for 2 months and saw very little change in my blood pressure; however, my pulse ratee increased.  Within a week of beginning this med, I started experiencing difficulties: A frequent dry cough;  I lost my sense of taste; decreased appetite (lost 17 lbs in 2 months; my mouth was extremly dry, especially at night, and I just felt plain sick for 2 months; very tired.

I have heart disease and am on metropolol plus statins.  I have had good success with Lisinopril.  The cough others have indicated was also a problem but I stuck with the meds and the cough is now gone after about 3-4 months with it.  I have leg cramps also but have had them for years.  the secret to dealing with them is to keep my legs and feet very warm at night. My blood pressure is never higher than 120/80 and my heart rate is about 62.  Previously my resting heart rate was 102. If you can stick with the meds thru the first six months I think some of the side effects will lessen.,5,4,5
i beieve it has worked for me i feel find i wonder if it can cause a cough,5,5,5
It seems that about and hour after taking I begin to become very tired and it lasts for most of the day.,5,4,5

Sucked on cough drops but did not help.  My throat has been sore for a month and now I know  now that all of this is from this terrible drug.  Thanks to all of you reviewers who took the time to write about your experience so it could help the rest of us!",1,1,1

Exhaustion, headaches, chills, sweats, loss of appetite, and feeling like my head is not screwed on straight. Dr. switched me to another med but if side effects make you too tired to exercise and take care of yourself what are we gaining ? ...very frustrating- but hoping to find a balance",4,1,4
Oh my god ! i have been gagging late at night and sinus drainage real bad and muscle cramps and it was the medicine. I'm still on medicine but no more side effects for now.

This is the third medicine that my doctor has tried on me for my blood pressure.  It works at lowering my bp but the fatigue and tiredness is intolerable.  I also can't sleep at night.

"Had been taking this drug about 2 months and developed a cough almost immediately.  Generally when I lay down to sleep the cough begins and persists for almost an hour.  Thought the cough was related to a cold I had just gotten over until I realized other people on this drug had the cough.  Also, started getting occasional ringing in my ears which now is almost non-stop.

The doctor put me on 10mg of lisinopril, it brought my BP down to 150/75, but brought my erectile ability to about 90% of what it normally is (still okay). Doctor increased to 20mg and then 40mg. At 20mg and 40mg (no difference between the two), my BP was around 135/75 and but my erectile ability dropped to about 40%...which is not okay. I am a personal trainer, and am only 25...too young to be dealing with impotence. Changed to cozaar, which lowers bp about 10 points and adds to sexual ability.",5,2,4

"Started at 5mg, then 10, then 20, then 40 (2 20s) and my BP improved but was underwhelming (middle 80s over middle 130s).  Then the doctor added 12.5 mg of a diuretic once a day, then 12.5 twice a day and still no change (except for more frequent bathroom trips).  I am not impressed with Lisinopril at all but it worked for my Dr.'s wife so he likes it.  If I am taking meds for hypertension, especially 2 meds twice a day I don't want just improved BP, I want GOOD BP.  I don't know what the change will be next month.",4,1,3

Also sneezing and sneezing in fits sometimes uncontrollable is another issue",5,4,5

On day I woke up, took my meds and in an hour I could not get the energy to get off of the couch.  My BP was 86/40.  After a couple more days of this, I finally stopped the med.  It was working too well with the other med and I was unable to function with that low BP.  I would say the med worked well but not to mix it with another without good follow up.",5,3,5
"I went to the doctor for an unrelated check, and discovered my blood pressure was high(154/90). The doctor prescibed this medication.I have been on it for 1 week and my B.P. has climbed steadily till today it was 168/112. I am discontinuing use till I see the doctor again in 2 days.",4,1,1

Right away the coughing started...all day and ESPECIALLY as soon as I lay down at night, non-stop.  5 minutues after I am in bed I cant breathe and I stay all stuffed up all night.  Cant used any decongestants.  Another stupid thing I noticed a couple of years back was incontinence.  Coughing all nite causes me to pee constantly.  I hate it.  I do have to say that the med does definitely work with my other meds to lower the pressure.  I went from 235/130 average to 116/70.  So it does work even if I pee every time I cough.",5,4,4
"I sometimes have dizziness and have a dry cough. My blood pressure remains low and stable. I can not take decongestants, but have found that Children's decongestants work. My pharmacist recommended it because the dose is low. I have allergies and congestion is hard to get rid of.",5,4,4

"Ever since my first episode of anxiety my blood pressure has been elevated and my doctor decided it was finally time to get on a blood pressure med. He prescribed Lisinopril. Hours after taking my first dose my upper abdomen hurt so bad as though I had some type of internal injuries. I began throwing up, fainting and ended up unable to walk much less even sit up for 3 days. I stopped taking it because I thought I had the flu and was too sick to even worry about my BP. When I got well I started the med again and my stomach had me doubled over in pain again for days. I finally read other reviews and learned from Lucky and Levettep it was this Lisinopril that was making me severely ill, like them. I saw my doctor and had to have an abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder problems. I ended up being treated for Gastritis and was told I had a bad allergic reaction to this drug. It's  been almost 2 months now and my stomach is still not healed. I have never in my life had a bad reaction to a drug like I did Lisinopril. No wonder it warns it can kill your unborn child if you're pregnant, I was so ill I felt as though it was going to kill me. Thank you to those who shared their experience with this drug, otherwise I don't think I would have figured out it was this BP med. that was making me so ill. The FDA should take a closer look at this dangerous medication and possibly recall it. I don't know if my stomach will ever completely heal!!!",1,1,1
"I've been having coughing and gagging with a tickle in my throat, also have sinus drainage which gets much worse when I lay down to sleep, if I can sleep with all the coughing and spitting up phlegm.

I finally went to a throat specialist and he told me about this drug and this cough being one of the side effects.",3,1,3

Although I do still have some anxiety left over from when I was taking Benicar...hoping that will go away soon.  It's fairly annoying.  But the good news is Lisinipril has been ok for me.",5,4,5
I have ben prescribed 80 mgss per day and they only come as high as 40 mgs,4,2,2
Effect of taking this caused me to have a hacking dry annoying cough as if I were a smoker.  Had drug switched to Atenolol in the evening 25mg and in the morning Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg.  Took over a month to rid the cough.  Much happier now and BP is averaging 120/80 - age 54,5,1,1
should i take this med in am or pm?  I feel exhausted all the time,3,2,3
Have just been diagnosed with Diabetes and HBP - last read at the Dr. Ofc was 170/104. Dr. put me on 40mg per day which I take right before bed. I workout 4-5 days a wweek and watch what I eat. Goal weight is 170 - I'm 5'7 176lbs now so 6lbs to go - on 1800 to 2000 cals a day. Also talking 1000mgs of Metformin a day 500mg/day - 500mg / night  - So far so good. ,5,4,4

Sometimes my BP goes dangerously low. I take 1/2 if over 140 and 1 whole if BP over 170 have been monitoring for Doctor for 2 weeks,4,3,3
Slight increase of cough at first. Other than that it's working just fine for me. I exercise and watch my my sodium intake which I'm sure is helping with my BP as well.,5,5,5
"I was taking Lisinopril for the past year now.  I started coughing soon after starting the drug but did not know it was a side effect.  I was coughing up to 100 times a day.  The cough got so bad that my dr. sent me to an allergist an ENT dr., plus chest xrays and lots of meds to try to control the cough.  I finally read about the side effects and got put on a med that is not an ACE.  My dr. never mentioned the side effects of this med.!!!  Even after a year of suffering daily and numerous appointments.  I feel like a fool for not looking this up sooner.  I still have the cough but it's getting less & less.",1,1,4
I have been taking this drug for a year and a half. Low dosage was not effective. Recently had dosage increased to 20mg form 10mg. Hopefully will lower BP more.,5,4,3
"I have had increases in this med since March with no change in BP, but increasing side effects. Doc said to ""be patient. Takes a while to work in some people."" I have tried other highBP meds without success, so put on lisinopril 10 mg. in May-mild dizziness and fatigue but no change in BP or 140/90 to 170/100. Increased to 20 mg in early August-chronic sore throat, fatigue, dizziness and balance problems worse. Increased to 30 mg. on Halloween. Sore throat became wet cough, insomnia, and draining nose. All getting worse and think these are from the Lisinopril. Money is limited, so have been patient in trying to get BP down. Have seen no change in BP and increasing side effects.",5,1,1
"dry coughs at nite. worse erectile disfunction. lot of sinus drainage when i lay down. ive also been having some weak muscles in my neck at night and a medicine head. ive been having some sinus issues, so i dont know how much of this is caused by the meds.",4,2,4
It is inexpensive which is a plus. I have had ddecent control of my blood pressure along with Bystolic. I have had a long term night cough that is very unforgiving and I just learned this medicine may be the cause. I hope not but need to know. I am loosing too much sleep from uncontrollable coughing.,5,3,3
Worked for a year then stopped.  Had a persistent dry cough while using it.  Many people have this side effect but it's not usually listed.,4,2,3

"This drug should be taken off the market.  My mom had to rush herself to the hospital at 3am on Friday 8/21/09 after the tonge and face had swollen.  Her tongue covered her entire mouth , I mean top to bottom and check to check.  The tongue covered her entire mouth.  Her face was almost swollen beyond recognition, and her tongue almost blocked her airway.  After she was admitted the Dr at the hospital explained that the mediation cause her tongue/face to swell and she probably needed a better medication. She thought she was having a stroke.  After a few calls from family members inquiring on her status.  I was shocked to see my grandfather (my mom's dad) and my great uncle (grandfathers brother) both has to be taken off Lisinopril after being rushed to the E.R for the same symptons.  I told my uncle since he and his wife are also on Lisinopril, he was shoked and said he would see his Dr. right away.  My moms morning nurse in the hospital told me to be sure when her pysicians follows up with her after being released, he doesn't prescribe anything in the "" Pril"" family of blood pressure medication.  Or any ACE Inhibitors, since they are know to have various side effects.  It also seems a lot of people have problems at or around 2+ years on Lisinopril.  It just a shame what is happening to so many people on this medication, I think the manufacturer knows this isn't a few cases, or random mishaps, it's a serious problem with this medication and I would avoid it at all cost !!!!",5,1,2

"After taking this med for 10 days, left side of upper lip began to swell at 0330. By 0800 upper lip was so big, it covered bottom lip.  Took Benadryl and received a steroid shot from doctor. 24 hours later, my lip and face are still swollen.",3,1,2
I'm no Doctor but I have been using this medication to control my blood pressure and for the last ten years my blood pressure has been better than normal. I also included physical exercise (badminton/yoga/walking) into my daily routine. I can only say that I believe my change to active lifestyle and this medication has had positive effects on lmy HBP restoring it to a normal BP.,5,5,5
"I sometimes have a dry hacking cough which is annoying at night.  Seems to also cause moderate erectile dysfunction after about 40 minutes of sex.  You can get your erection back to finish the session, but when you're not used it losing it, it can be a little disconcerting.",5,3,4
I HAVE A CHRONIC COUGH WHICH KEEPS ME AWAKE AT night. This is a side effect of the med.,5,2,4
"Took this med for 1 1/2 years worked great then one night I wook up with my tongue and throat swollen and right side of my face drewping. Yes I had a stroke!!! When I got to the ER the doctor asked me what kind of HBP med was I on, I told them Lisinopril and they told me that having this stoke was one of the side affects! I was taking a med to lower my bp so I wont have a stoke and the same med caused me to have one. I would look for another med. and research it before taking it.",1,1,1
only took two doses of 10 mil and started to sweat and had real loose bowls and stomach nausea and dark urine. stopped immeaditly and still have loose bowls and stomach aches. Will never take it again. it's pretty bad when the possibe side effects are worse than the origanl problem. Who wants to take somthing that can be fatal and cause severe liver damage.,5,1,1
Been on lisinopril and hafe of clondine 3xday for 1 week hart rate up over 100.,4,1,1
"I have been taking this medicine for three years.  This morning I woke up and my right upper lip was completely swollen.  While at the ER, the doctor said that it was a common side effect--even if the person had taken it for a prolonged period of time. I had to go back to the ER about 3 hours later because my mouth became even bigger! As I was checking in, a nurse looked at my mouth and said, ""Oh, you take Lisinopril, right? I see that reaction all the time here, plus, I had it myself.""  The second Dr. came out and told me my airwaves and oxygen were okay and that I was just going to have to wait it out (they had earlier prescribed me Benyadryl and a steroid). Then he explained he had to stop using the medicine himself because is tongue became swollen. This is a common occurance. And if you are like me, you assume if you are going to have a reaction to a medicine, it's going to be rather early.  This side effect can take time before it shows. Be careful, apparently it is a very common incident with this drug.  ",3,1,5

The treatment was two ER visits and two operations to the tune of $50,000!!!  I stopped the medicine pronto and found a woman doctor who is working with me to take me off of it slowly.

Dr. increased dosage (even tho bp had dropped) 3 days later I developed allergy symptoms; congestion,very runny nose and loss of hearing. Went to Dr. took cipro 10 days; no help; saw reports so cut med in half and seemed better; hearing better; May 27 developed severe sinus infection (never before had one) took Z-Pak 10 days; added 2 more antibiodics and hearing is still getting worse.  Beware of ototoxic drugs - ask Drs.  Am seeing Dr. in 2 days and have an appt. to ear/nose/throat spec. next week. Hearing loss may be irreversible.  It did help my blood pressure, but so did my prev. one. Worse part is you have these problems and impossible to see Dr. - and they dont always listen. Should have seen spec. earlier, but as one Dr. said ""you just need a hearing aid""  I told my new  Dr. that I will not take lisinopril again. Does anyone else notice hearing loss - I am very hard of hearing and can't hear phone ring and I was the one who ""heard"" a pin drop til this started.  Be careful of drugs!

In last 7 weeks been to doctor twice-I have had 4 shots, 2 breathing treatments, 2 z-packs of prednisone, 2 different antibodies, 3 cough medicines and two nasal sprays,2 blood tests and one chest x-ray. Nothing showed up in any of the tests. Each time I would get better on medicine, then relapse 2 days after completing medicine. I thought at the time I was dealing with two separate problems,side effects from lisinopril and upper respiratory infection. Last night I tried to attend my grandson ballgame and coughed so much, lost my breath couldn't swallow from mucous in throat, felt like I was drowning from fluid. After I got home got onto internet and read these reviews,and knew right away it was the Lisinopril, not upper respiratory infection.I have not taken one since Thursday night, will call cardilogist Mon. and report side effects and go onto something else.

After I would sit down for a while and try to stand, I would barely be able to walk.  My ankles would hurt so bad.  One Sunday while sitting in a recliner I had to put a pillow behind my back to ease the aching I was feeling.

Developed the night time, itchy back of throat cough, metalic taste, sometimes dizzy when first standing up, noticable reduction of libido, restless sleep and many times waking from sleep feeling very warm, sometimes sweating, and my heart rate very high.  After reading most of these postings, decided enough of this!  I needed to change my eating habits, lose weight and exercise.  I cut my dose in 1/2 for a month, then down to 1/4 for another month.  Check with your doctor before reducing your dose.  During this time I ate less and better, and began to exercise at least five days a week, 30 plus minutes a day.  I now sleep soundly, no waking up overheated, no itchy cough, metalic taste is gone, dizzy no more.  After four months, I weigh 30 lbs less with 25 lbs to more to go.

Make sure that you mention the cough, or the doctors do not link that symtom with Lisinopril.",1,1,1

I was searching for my mom actually, she been on Lisinopril for about 4+ years and she has been complaining about sore muscles and trouble sleeping, trouble swallowing and very fatigue. The doctor even gave her medication for depression so she can sleep. I even thought she had fibromi---- (can't spell either) but nothing, thank you very much for the comments I will have her check out. Maybe all those years of pain has to do with the high blood pressure medication.",3,2,3
I started taking this medication in Jan 09 and after 3 days my vision was blurry and ended up at the Opthamologist with a new eyeglass Rx not knowing it was this medication.  I also have body aches and coughing.  I thought the body aches were laying restless in the bed at night but now know thats probably from this drug as well.  I also experience the lightheadedness.

My pharmacist said the Lisinopril has an ACE Inhibitor ingredient and the Benicar does not. A lot of people have coughing, etc reactions.

I posted a self review yesterday but after reading some of the complants from people I realise I have had alot of the problems as well. After a day or two taking lisinopril I started tossing & turning in bed not able to sleep because my musles were sore. I thought I was getting fibromialgia. (can't spell) I will say it has gone away now but I still have this wad of flim in my throat I just can't seem to swallow. It does work for me if I can do somthing about this flim. My BP was 134/ 82 at the Dr's office the other day and it hasen't been that low for a long time. I also get very tired very quick and just don't feel like doing a thing. The DR dismissed it as being lazy but I think it is the medicine. I'm 62 and what I think is fairly healthy for that age. I was wondering if anyone has had the flim in the throat?,4,2,5

My vision is somewhat blurry at times too. If I forget to take it for a day, I get terrible diarrhea.  Has anyone stopped taking this and found a more suitable medication?",5,3,4
I have read 50 to 60 comments I seem to be getting along better than most. I'm having a problem with a what I call flim in my throat that I can't seem to swallow. I have tryed to gargle it away. I've tryed to eat bread but I can't swallow it. As I'm typing this there is a jag of it in my throat right now and it's driving me crazy. Other than that and getting tired really really fast I must be doing OK. Has any one had a lump of flim in their throat that no matter what they do you just can't swallow it?,4,4,4
I had the coughing when I first got the medication but after 6 months it went away. It does make me very tierd but I use it right before I go to sleep and this seems to help with that issue. Been on lots of bp meds this has the least side effects for me,4,4,4
"I was on this medication for approx 3 months, developed awful cold, then the coughing started.  Cold went away but the coughing attacks intensified, especially at night.

I was aware the cough was the most common side effect, but was unaware of the anxiety, sleep disruptions, low sex drive and loss of concentration until I started reading the other comments.

After taking this drug for one month(5mg)and my doctor taking me off Zebeta my blood pressure went up drastically. My doctor felt that I needed to up the dose to (10mg)- and it did not help! (160/113 p114)  This drug caused aweful side effects including a deep cough. I went back in to the doctor because I thought maybe something was wrong with my home bp cuff...it wasn't wrong - my bp was going up and getting worse.  She took me off and put me back on Zebeta (10mg) and the pressure this morning is back to 124/82 p 67.    I really believe if I kept taking this drug it would have led to a heart attack based on my body reaction.,5,1,1
"I have been taking 10mg 2x daily for about 1 year and it has lowered my bloodpressure, 129/89. Tonight in a desperate attempt to get information on my severe cough and asthma/bronchial spasms, I accidentally ran into an article linking lisinopril. It never crossed my mind that this could be the reason for my severe allergy and asthma attacks. Since the begining of 2009, I have been treated three times with the Z-pak and have to keep my albutorol inhaler on my person. One incident was so severe, I had to be taken to the ER. These coughing attacks usually occur at nights. I have an appointment to see an allergist/immunologist for next week. Reading about 100 of these reviews tonight have brought tears to my eyes because of how much I have been suffering with these symptoms over the past year. I will stop this medication immediately and will see my Dr on Monday. I do also experience extreme fatigue, extreme heartburn, weightgain and lightheadedness quite regularly. This is amazing.

From now on, I will check this website before purchasing meds. I suggest you ask your doctor for samples because it seems that bp meds all have side effects, and you have to choose the one that will affect you the least. Bad medicine! ",4,1,2
"Well I was very surprised after reading at least 30 reviews; but now I know why I have my coughing, especially at night. I have been on this med since Jan 2006.

THIS MEDICINE CAUSED ME TO HAVE EXTREME HEART POUNDING. AT TIMES I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WAS HAVEING A HEART ATTACK.,5,1,1
"This medication caused severe swelling of my upper lip after only one 10 mg dose.  Approximately 18 hours after taking the first dose, the swelling started.  At first it was just a small portion of my upper lip.  By the end of dinner, it was my whole upper lip.  It looked like a collagen treatment gone bad.  I didn't go to the emergency room that night, because I knew it wasn't an allergic reaction, but when I got up the next morning and the swelling was moving into the skin directly under my nose, I did go to an urgent care clinic.  Luckily my fears weren't completely justified.  I was told not to take any more of the meds and to take a steroid for 5 days to mitigate the effects of the Lisoprinil as it worked it's way out of my system.  Thank heavens the swelling went down.  I was getting all kinds of stares.  My boyfriend jokingly referred to it as duck lips once we both knew it was something that could be easily treated.  It's funny now, but scared the heck out of me when I saw how much swelling was present.  Be careful with this one!",5,1,1

I am presently about 30 lbs overweight and I pretty much know that's a good portion of my BP problem anyway so I also started walking again - about 2 miles a day and do some lifting of low weight dumbells about 3 nights a week and drink a lot more water to flush my system.  Maybe this is helping keep away  some of these symptoms.  Also have elderly father in home who cannot use salt so low sodium has always been a way of life here which also helps so we'll see how continued use gets.  ,5,5,5

"Have recently begun taking Lisinopril due to Insurance cutbacks on my Zestril. My co-pay was increased, which made Lisinopril much cheaper. I feel lousy on the Lisinopril, light-headed, spacey, not focused, unusual knee pain, and drowsy.  I plan to go back to Zestril immediately.  It did a great job for me, kept my BP down, without any side effects.  Lisinopril has not kept my numbers as low as they should be.  BP is elevated, and the air-headedness is ridiculous.

I felt horrible on the Lisinopril, very weak, extremely tired, muscle aches and several episodes of dizziness.  It wasn't worth me saving a few dollars a month to feel that miserable.

My doctor switched me from Calan to Lisinopril because I was retaining too much water.  In addition to being treated for high blood pressure I am being treated for asthma.  No matter what my doctor prescribed to control my coughing spells it did not help.  By accident I discovered that Lisinopril causes coughing spells in some patients.  I stopped taking Lisinopril and the coughing spells and asthma have both gone away.  I now take Telmisartan (Micardis) and my blood pressure is just where my doctor thinks it ought to be.,5,1,3

"About 4 years ago I complained to my Dr. that the Zestril I was taking wasn't working anymore,(I read my pressure at home),so she put me on Lisinopril,little did I know it was the same med. My pressure did come down but I felt tired.  I also suffer from depression and anxiety,so I contributed alot of the side effects to that. I started having chest discomfort,like a throbby heart beat and then skipping beats and the Dr. raised my antidepressants,but I still had that chest discomfort. I went through a battery of heart tests and all were negative,my heart was in good condition,BUT the discomfort would come and go.  Last summer I developed a pain in my left side and my vision was getting blurry. I saw the Eye Dr. and I had an eye infection,which seems to return each spring for the past 2 years.  The chest discomfort was really bad the past 2 years and I had no idea that this med was noted for this condition.  I saw my Dr. 2 days ago because I'm sick of feeling this bad,she didn't change the meds.just said that she thought maybe I needed some more tests on my heart.  After reading all of these reviews,I now know that the Lisinopril is responsible for them.  I trusted my Dr. to help me but when I point out that the meds are the cause of my discomfort and it is ignored,I have to wonder just how much she really does know. My BP is down and has been,but these side effects are killing me,as I can't sleep at night,I have the sinsus drainage,and a general feeling of unwellness,not to mention leg pain.  I love to read but everytime I set down to read I fall asleep and after reading a few pages,my vision is so blurry I can't see the words on the pages,I had my eyes examined and changed glasses last spring and I still can't see good.",4,1,3

However, each winter I would have extremely chapped lips, with a red almost kool-aid stain looking rash around my mouth and my lips would be swollen in the morning.  It was attributed to allergies, however after switching doctors, I explained this to my new doctor and she immediately attributed it to the lisinopril and switched me over to Cozaar.  Since switching my lips have not been extremely chapped swollen and the rash has not appeared.",4,2,4

"My Husband started taking this medication about 3 weeks ago. I have seen a noticable change in his health.

At first it was just at night but now has become constant during the day also. I called my doctor after talking to a friend and reading these reviews. I will no longer be taking this drug, if I need more than my atenonl we will visit this later. I have had heaviness in the chest, and feel tired all the time. I had been attributing this to having a stent placed several months ago. Spent a whole bunch of money on additional stress tests and nuclear heart testing since the stent. I am thinking this medication could have been causing many if not all of my symptoms. The troubling part is none of these side effects which I discussed with my Dr. and the testing personnel were attributed to this drug. Just more tests. To say I am somewhat disturbed by this is an understatement. ",4,2,4
"I used this medicine for many years(~15).  Then I had a times where my tougue swelled during the night and I had to have steroid treatments etc.  After three of these over a 6 month time frame, I was told by one emergency room doctor, that lisinopril was the cause and to stop taking it.  I did and was fine for a month or so but then had another tongue swelling episode.  Now total cofusion with this product and my condition.",5,4,4

One stroe I was getting my meds from gave me a report on each drug I had to take well, with the price of gas and distance I had to drive I changed pharmacies and they gave reports on drugs also.  That's when I found out this mediction can cause dry cough.  (one pharmacy report contains this info and the other doesn't)so all this time I have been coughing and gagging and now it feels like there is something caught in the back of my throat.

I was tired all the time, my heart would palpitate occasionally, and I had trouble catching my breath. After 3 weeks I called my doctor to complain of the cough only to be prescribed a cough medicine which didn't touch the problem.  I couldn't sleep at night because of the cough even with sleep aids.  I had trouble focusing on the simplest of tasks at work and had blurred vision.  I finally got online to research the dry cough (I was afraid it was throat cancer) only to find an abundance of sites associated with side effects of lisinopril.  I immediately stopped taking the drug.  It's been 5 days and the cough is still as bad as it was before.  I've never been more miserable in my life.",1,1,1

The second unplanned trip to the ER and the doctor there told me that this is a common side effect. I have an appt to see an allergist and the ER doctor says he's sure the allergist will agree with him.  Life threatening side effects are incredibly scary.

My I can say that as I continue to take my meds and treat my hair I have nice and thick hair again and haven't had any more problems with my hair again. I do notice that I cough alot and I was talking with a friend that take meds for her high blood that said she bet I'm probably coughing from the meds and I went to the doctor and mentioned it to him about all the coughing since he increased my meds from 10 to 20 mgs now he stated that it could be from the meds and he schedule me to come back within 3 weeks to see if I'm still having the cough he will consider putting me on another one. But overall I can say I haven't notice any other signs or discomforts with taking the med and my blood pressure is under controll at this point and the increase in my meds was due to stress when my grandmother was extremely sick with cancer before passing.,5,3,5

"Using this drug has lowered my BP. I have been on it for 9 months. A cough has developed which mostly happens when I get into bed. Other symptoms are no energy/tired, heartburn, constipation, which I never experienced before. I find my BP level creeping up 10 15 points lately. I plan to find another BP med soon. ",5,2,4
"Lisinopril does a great job of lowering bp, however, if you are among those who develop a cough from this drug, you and your doctor may need to consider other options.  I developed a terrible, hacking cough that kept me up at night and is very difficult to quiet.  For me, the cough did not respond to water, cough drops or cough medicine.  I have been off this drug for almost a week and the cough has only abated slightly.  I cannot wait to get a good nights rest again.  I'm back on my beta-blocker and somewhat fatigued, but at least I'll be able to sleep again!",5,1,5
"I had no idea that my horrible cough was being caused by this med. My MD said if I quit smoking my cough would go away. I'm glad i quit smoking, but the cough is worse than ever. I'll have to get on something different. thanks for the reviews!!!",5,1,4
I've been on this medicine for 1 year and have repeatedly been in the hospital for  severechest pains because of this drug. Its helped only little.,2,1,1
Have been on this med for over 2 years and it has been great for my blood pressure. It is not pricey and does a wonderful job. I only need the low dose.,5,5,5
i guess it has lowered my bp but the cough is horrible i can't stand it anymore it is so embarassing especially when i start gagging from couging so much and i get nausea. I'm going to ask my pcp to give me something else,4,2,3
what the doctors dont tell you about this drug is that it does cause a couch that will never go away. It took me a complete year and I still have the couch alittle. it work wonders but the side effects where bad.,4,2,4
I WAS RECENTLY HOSPITALIZED FOR MY BLOOD PRESSURE BEING SO HIGH (235/173). AND THE NURSE WHO WAS ASSISTING ME GAVE ME THIS MEDICATION THROUGH THE IV AND WORKED FOR ME INSTANTLY. IT ALSO HELPS ME FROM GOING TO THE BATHROOM OFTEN.,4,5,5

"Started on clonidine .02, 3 years ago, but it was too short acting, BP kept see-sawing. I started taking Lisinpril Nov. 12, 2008. 20mg, once a day. It keeps my BP at an average 117/75 to 125/83, MUCH BETTER than the clonodine.  Side effects: No coughing but allergic type reaction, area around my sinuses and sensitive upper gums/teeth roots is swelling, a dull numbing feeling. Especially when I inhale. I try to live with it, but sometimes it's very annoying, uncomfortable. I get into depressive moods because of it. I want to ask my doc to let me try another type of drug. ",4,2,5
"I started taking lisinopril in August and by Thanksgiving I wound up in the hospital with such severe coughing that my lungs got damaged.  I could not go out in public because I did not know when I would have a coughing fit.  When I quit taking the drug, my lungs got back to normal.  Don't take this drug.",5,1,1

"I have been plagued by tiredness, can't sleep, itchy swollen ear canals, dry cough, pounding heart with occasional skipping of beats, and esophageal problems. I had no idea it could be because of this med. Thanks for all yourreviews and I am calling myMD.",5,2,4
Lowered my pressure,5,5,5
"Med lowered my BP from 160+ down to 130 - 140 level in conjunction with my Doxazosin, but created what apears to be sinus drainage and a cough. Staying cool eases cough and being warm worstens cough. Realy disturbs sleep at night. Stayed off drug for a couple days, sinus drainage stopped and cough cleared up. Will advise Dr. and ask for a change.",5,3,4
"I stopped taking lisinopril 10 mg because I had heart palpitations ,then my doc gave me 2.5 mg of amlodipine and am still having palpitations going to see a cardiologist today to make sure there is nothing wrong.I take my bp at home now and it rarely ever goes above 130/80 I think with diet and more weight lose I will be fine without the meds.make sure you ask your doctor about all possible side effects!",5,1,3
is good ,5,3,3
"So far this medication has worked for me to lower my blood pressure. Be on it about two weeks. The first night I took it, my head felt clogged as if I had a bad head cold and I couldnt hear to well. After that first night things seemed to be okay. I noticed I urinate alot at night, but I am also taking a water pill. I exercise alot and noticed some pudginess around my waist that wasnt there before. Another thing is a loss of sex drive, I just have no interest. I will stay on it, most important is for my blood pressure to stay down. ",5,4,5
Experience dry cough and throat irriation with this medication.  I had asked my doctor to change my blood pressure script to a less expensive generic.  Not worth it I am going back on Hyzaar.  Although lisinopril worked on my B.P. it's side effect is very bothersome to me.  My doctor told me that other patients have also reported these symptoms.,4,1,4
I WAS PUT ON THIS DRUG WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS AGO. IT HAS WORKED FOR ME SINCE DAY ONE AND I HAVE NEVER HAD TO INCREASE THE DOSAGE NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN ON ANY OTHER DRUG FOR HTN.,5,5,5
"My bllod presure went down to a god rate, but my limbs (arms and legs) began to feel heavy, don't know if it wad muscle weakness or fatigue.  This after 2 weeks, alittle dizziness, at work and in bed.  Don't know it it caused nose bleeds, but I had them twice.  Today I went to my doctor, I also told her about a cough that I've seemed to have for the past 3 weeks.  Today I got a new medicine prescription for Diovan HCT 12.5-80 mg, let's see what this does.  Did not like this drug at all.",3,2,4
"Seems Less effective in lowering blood pressure as usage continues. Blood pressure goes way above the level for which treatment was initiated if you stop taking it. BP was in the 140s when I started  Lisinopril treatment, but became short tempered and experienced ED so I stopped taking it. Within days, BP was over 160 and I started gaining weight so I started taking it again. ",4,3,3
"It lowered my blood pressure but made me sick. Heart palpitations, nausea, anxious, loss of appetite. I thought the cure was worse then the ailment. I have started taking 1/2 med. ",5,1,5
"Mother was admitted to hospital on 12/31/08 from a severe allergic reaction to Lisinopril which caused swelling of tongue.  I could not believe a human tongue could swell to the magnitude my mother's tongue swelled to.  We were informed while in ER that it would be a possibility she would neet a trach may have to be inserted, but thank God, she did not need one.  Mother was in ICU at local hospital for 13 days and then was moved from ICU to another room in the hospital.  While in ICU mother was not aware of anything and was being assisted by breathing machines and tubes for feeding.  While reading the different reviews, I am amazed at the various reactions this medication causes and yet it has not been pulled from the shelves of pharmacies and medical facilities across the USA. As of this writing she still remains hospitalized with having to eat pureed food because of the tubes inserted in her. I feel the makers of this product needs to know the severity this medication causes and should be held accountable for their actions. We pray that our mother is left with no other illness caused by this medication and recovers fully from it.",5,3,3
"Brought down BP, thank Jesus, was very happy. Almost 3 months later I feel like someone else... BUT NOT AT ALL IN A GOOD WAY! I did not read the side effects when starting so not to preconceive anything. I now experience... BLURRED VISION, DRY HACKING COUGH, URINATION DARK FREQUENT & URGENT, INCREASED LOOSE BOWEL MOVEMENTS, LETHARGIC, DEPRESSION, DIZZY, TREMORS/NERVOUSNESS, JOINT/MUSCLE PAIN & NUMBNESS IN LEFT HAND, SLEEPLESSNES, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, FEELS LIKE MY HEART IS POUNDING & FLUTTERING SOMETIMES (ESPECIALLY IN EVE/NIGHT), NAUSEA, BAD TASTE, FULLNESS IN RIGHT EAR, LOWER SEX DRIVE, MY HAIR APPEARS TO BE THINNING AND EVEN A FEW MORE STRANGE THINGS. I know this may seem like someone with a mental issue is writing this, and I've been very reluctant, but if this will help others that's what counts. I have felt like someone very opposite of myself. Thank God I do not drink alcohol, smoke or do drugs. I am a businessman with a wonderful family and have a lot to live for. Yes, my BP did come down, as I feel was a direct result of this drug, but so would cutting off my head. I hope this has been a help. I just do not understand how dangerous drugs get passed thru the FDA. I agree to no testing on animals, but even more so for us humans! Best Regards           ",4,1,3
"Effective in lowering BP. Side effects include cough, itching ears, draining sinus, ED, itching on upper body, fatigue/listlessness, frequent urination, and inability to sleep.  Thought I was just getting old until I read comments on this site.",5,2,5
I feel much better but an suffering from wild nightmares since taking.  I wake several times a night from some manner of wild almost childlike nightmare that has never burdended me before taking this medication.,3,2,3
Had every side effect with no information from doctor or pharmacist.  Almost ran off the Interstate when I almost passed out while drfiving.  Scared me BIG time.  Researched it here and got highly upset I was NOT informed of the major side effects it can cause. BEWARE!!!!,1,1,1
"BP still climbs from time to time, but not to stroke level",5,4,4
"I have had unsteadiness and feelings of faint- ing or dizzines upon standing which is very reppetitive during the Catholic Mass. The most common thing has been frequent and urgency to urinate which causes nausea that usualy subsides after urination. On some occasions, my nausea requires a half a pill of Promethazine (Pho quiet the Phenergan)  to stop the nausea. I have reduced the dose from a half a pill to a fourth of a pill a day but the nausea continues, I also take Lithium Carbonate, Mirtazepine, and Hydroxyzine for Bipolar Disorder and Panic Attacks/Phobia/PTSD from VietNam and am a 100 % Disabled American Veteran due to some traumatic experiences leading up to a  medical discharge after 13 months with the 3rd Marine Division as A Navy Hospital Corpsman. I am also taking Clonazepam 0.5 mg 3 X a day for severe anxiety. I feel  pretty good for a 70 year old man nonsmoker and non drinker who is concerned abbout the nausea and dizziness.  I stopped taking the HCTC at the doctor's request and wonder if  the lisinopril in such a low dose can be causing the nausea, etc?",2,2,2
Works for HBP but within 2 days of taking developed a night time cough that was miserable!!,4,1,3
started on 20mg had low sex drive after starting through diet and exrercise have control of HBP dropped to 10mg sex drive improved on 5 mg now dosen't effect it  I take it at night no problems have issue with hearing in left ear feels like blockage any one else have this MD keeps me on it for kidney protection for type 2 diabities,4,3,3
I am a 38yr old male and have been on 20mg once a day for nearly a year. Brings bp down slightly but I feel run down alot and have no interest in sex at all. Also my hands and feet are cold alot and sometimes my fingers appear as if they are getting no blood to them at all. They turn yellow and purple. Due to go back to the Dr. in March.,5,2,4
"Of course the ideal is to have no side effects, but finding that probably impossible I started taking this drug as a replacement for Diovan which didn't work at all for me.  Lisinopril was prescribed for me at 40mg once a day to start.  My b/p was ranging around 160/100.  Scared to start this drug at such a high dose especially after having bad reactions to Diovan and reading other patient reviews that Lisinopril was derived from snake venom (not true according to my Dr. and pharmacist), I started at 10mg once per day.  No side effects except for a tiny bit of light headedness and feeling inconsistent itchiness.  After 2 weeks at 10mg, I upped the dose to 15mg per day for another 2 weeks.  Now at 20mg once per day and blood pressure down to approx. 125/79 and side effects not any worse (in fact, the ""itchy"" feeling has let up).  I do feel extra tired when getting up in the morning (I take this drug at night), but overall feel a lot better because my blood pressure is dropping.  I've also lost a little weight since being on Lisinopril which is great because I had gained an atrocious appetite while I was on Diovan. I only wish that people that write reviews on drugs would quit exaggerating and imagining side effects that don't really exist and be truthful about their experience.  ",5,4,5
Lowered my blood pressure somewhat. Still too high after 6 months useage.,4,3,2
"Has worked well in controlling my BP, but the side effects are NOT worth it! I have been on 10mg 1x daily of this drug for 29 days and ever since, my quality of life has suffered. I stay tired, I'm constantly light headed. I'm 38 and have the sex drive of someone twice my age. All of these side effects seemed to happen immediatly after starting this drug. I see my doctor this afternoon for my 1 month checkup and will demand that she change my medication. I felt better when I had high BP! God Bless",5,1,5
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll                                It has been easy taking this medicine.  I do not think it is heping.   ,4,4,3

"Have been on lisinopril 10 mg for two months. Have developed dry hacking cough, dizziness, dry eyes and blured vision. My heart sometimes pounds and it is hard to catch my breath. Feet and hands are always cold. About a week ago I developed severe lower back pain. Now hips are hurting and almost feels like I have bad cramps.

first week on this medicine i gained twelve pounds.  had to eat before taking it and once takin it would knock me out and the whole day i would be groggy and tired.  needless to say that i am no longer on this medicine.,2,2,4
A couple days after taking this med I broke out with hives covering my entire body. I took benedryl for the itching and it made me sick. Is this med at all related to the Sulfa drug family?,5,1,1
"I am HIV POZ take this drug for  kidney problems not any more swelling of face  and hands pins and needles all over,burning sensation , on face and hard time swallowing food, like a bubble stuck mid chest and food would get stuck and hard to swallow. so i am off this drug for good reardless of what my dr says  ",1,1,1
At first I was taking this medication during the night and it did not work.  I had to go to the hospital because during the night my blood pressure was still going up.  What the doctor recommended was to take it during the morning and 80 mg.  Now the medication is working.,4,4,4
I'm not dead yet.,4,3,3

I believe that this has helped me but I have had some hair loss. But the hair did come back. The back of my head near the cente3r had a bald spot bu it is back. Stress which is gone may have been a factor.,3,3,3
"After a heart attack at age 57, my Dr. put me on lisinopril. I was on it exactly 3 weeks, when I felt like I had stood in a pile of fire ants. My feet itched, then my hands itched and  swelled. I took Benadryl to ease the itching. The next day I developed raised, red welts in my groin and a cough. Also sinus congestion. I called my Dr--he said to stop the drug, now! Later the same day it felt like I was having another heart attack---pressure in chest, short of breath, so I went to the ER. It was not heart related. I am allergic to the drug. It's been a LONG week since I stopped the drug and I still feel like crap. Itching, and GERD symptoms persist. The Dr. said it will take 7-10 days to get the drug out of my system---meanwhile I'm on Benadryl every 4-6 hrs.  After reading many of these comments, this drug should be outlawed!!!!!",2,1,1
"I took Lisinopril for 7 days only.  After 3 or 4 days, I had discomfort in my left arm and wrist almost constantly and periodic pain at night.  Developed a small rash on left forearm and then it turned into something that looked like a bruise.  Had no energy.  Stopped taking it after 7 days but side effects continued to get worse for next 4 days.  Frequent urination - one night had to get up 6 times.  After being off medicine for a week, starting to feel normal again.  Left arm still has some discomfort but no periodic pain at night and no more frequent urination.

"My high bp is caused by kidney disease, stage 3. I take 2.5mg, lowest dose and have ringing in ears, dry and wet cough 24/7, hot flashes(menopause), frequent nose bleeds, tingling feet, but Dr. says this med. will help to slow down kidney disfunction as well as lower bp. A low sodium diet is necessary for anyone with hbp, but is so hard to do. Our processed food is full of types sodium, not just salt.Dining out is a hassle. Now I hear daughter has kidney disease, it runs in families, have yours checked, it could be in yours.",4,2,3
Just started using this drug after being diagnosed w/hbp...Now i'm reading about hair loss..whats up w/that? My hair is already thin and fine. Will I lose it in clumps?,5,4,3
I  developed a cough and esophagus problems after taking this drug.  i have not gotten rid of the cough and wondered if it would ever go away.,1,1,1

"I have headaches every day which I also experienced with hydrochlorothiazide.  It is a piercing left temple headache.

There was just to many cons and not enough pros about the side effects. Thanks for your info, this should be able to get back to the drs, when they have more time to spend w/you, then rush you in and out oh she did give me a Rx for my Strep Throat that I will take.

"I take 2 meds (vitamins too).  Lisinopril and tricor.  I CANNOT sleep.  Legs twitch at bottom, go numb at top.  If I manage to take a nap because of lack of sleep at nite, I wake with heart pounding so hard it's unbelievable.  Slight bouts of depression.  It's hard to know which is the culprit tricor or lisinopril.  Have horrible cough too.  I'm thankful for this website.  Dr. recommended it.  From all the comments it seems we're all guinea pigs and even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while (it may work for one thing, but cause something worse). I feel like throwing all prescribed meds in garbage and taking my chances with what God has given me.",5,2,2

I'm taking 40 mg. and my pressure has decreased to a borderline range. I am concerned with a possible side effect of thinning of my hair and lack of body texture of my hair ,2,2,2
I felt really well after taking the first few days of this medicine with visible side affects.,5,5,5
I was on this medication for over 6 mo. when I complained to my dr. that I had a very dry cough and ringing in my ears. She said that it was probably allergies. I never had an allergy in my life. I also became very dizzy while turning in my sleep. My dr. gave me pills for vertigo. I was getting ready for hip replacement surgery when my dr. said that my potassium levels were very high (6) and I should stop eating bananas or she won't clear me for surgery. I don't eat bananas. Did my own research told her that the lisinopril was causing all my symptoms and she finally switched me to atenolol and had the surgery. Thought I had a very good dr. from UCLA with honors and I had to diagnose myself!,4,1,4
"I had a very bad experience after the use of Fleet Phosphosoda as a bowel prep for a Colonoscopy. If you are age 55 or over, please read the FDA report on the use of Lisinopril and this bowel prep.

"Side effects, numerous, dry cough, itchy eyes, dehydration feeling and tired feeling.",4,3,5
"I began taking this medication in August 2008 at the lowest dosage. It was fine I had no problems and no side effects. But I recently went back to the doctor because I thought I was retaining water and he increased the dosage. It has been a little over a week since he increased my dosage and I have started out being really lethargic (which I knew was a side effect).  Then i became light headed at times.  Now a week and a half after the new dosage I have this horrible cough that I can't seem to get rid of.  I've been taking the normal allergy medicines that usually work for me, but this cough is consistent--dry at times and other times it is full of mucus.  I can't sleep because I'm coughing, I can't have a conversation with someone because I'm coughing.  After reading everyone else's posts, it falls in line with the same symptoms.  Definitely calling the doctor on Monday for a new prescription or will find a new doctor. Besides, BP is still high.",4,2,3
Brought my BP down from 175/110 to 125/83 in two weeks. Amazing? Also keeps my me coughing like I have the whooping cough - day and night. Nothing seems to help relieve it for more than a minute or two. Went off drug after three weeks of hell; now on Amlodipine (Calcium chnnel blocker) - but I am still coughing almost one week after ceasing Lisinopril. I understand the cough can linger on for weeks. I think it's best to exercise and diet to get to a healthy weight if your high BP is affected by your diet & weight. At least one might be able to reduce their dosage a bit.,4,1,4
"The first day that I took Lisinopril I had no side effects and my blood pressure was down, but the next day I was dizzy and my heart was racing and my pulse was over 100. The second day I still have racing heart/pulse. I called my doctor to put me back on my old medicine.  I found that It doesn't mix well with celebrex.  I also have the cough, but I didn't know that it was from this and the sinus.  I will not take this medicine anymore.",4,1,1

No job can't get help when you do must waiting until you are almost dead to get it. Big companies make money on your behalf make them pay when a drug they put on market almost kills someone or does kill someone.

Doc acts like he doesn't know what is going on. Maybe it's not an act. I am changing both the meds and the doc. Taking no more of this trash. I am glad to have found this site! his is my 3rd BP doc.

I use cough-drops and throat losenges, and this seems to help most of the time.  Especially at night.  I do feel fatigued alot, but this could also be from a combination of other problems and meds I have.  I have had no other side effects, and this med is working well for me so far.",5,4,5
I've developed a dry cough since being on this drug.,5,3,5

The first 2 weeks I had horrible headaches, but those have stopped. Now I am experiencing abnormal numbness and poor circulation in my arms and legs. Has anyone else experienced this?",4,1,1
"Have not noticed many side effects, but, after taking it a month or two, I had a blood test for my cholesteral, and my liver was slightly elevated, so I was put on Omega 3 for the cholesteral, instead of a drug. Now, a year later, when I went in for a blood test for my thyroid, they also checked my liver count, and it has gone sky high, way over what it should be. So now I have to find out if the lisinopral is what is causing it. And I believe it is. Has anyone else had this problem?",5,1,4
"I took this as a preventive measure for diabetes as its supposed to be good for the kidneys.  Additionally, I was starting to get borderline HBP.  I had to stop when a got a NASTY cough.  It was unrelentless.",2,1,3
I started taking lisnopril about a year ago and had some serious side effects.  The main problem was the dry cough and heaving that I developed.  At night I could not sleep without having a glass of water by my bedside.  During my normal work hours I couldn't hold a conversation without a hard piece of candy.  The condition got worse until I changed doctor's and medication.  Now that I don't take lisnopril there is no more dry cough and heaving.  My advice get another medication before that one kills you.,1,1,1
"I have been on Lisinopril, 5 mgs., for nearly a year now. I did have some dizzyness, headaches, and sinus pressure but recently developed ""burning mouth syndrome,"" which is sometimes caused by Ace Inhibitors, which this drug is. I experimented to see if getting off the medication helped with this, and it did. The first time I tried even half a pill, it came back immediately. I was lucky to have read about this side effect as I did not know what was causing it for a couple of months. I did like that the drug is one of the $4 drugs around town. I am being put now on Norvasc with no health insurance, and I understand it is pricey. I am very sensitive to medications with lots of drug allergies so I hate taking any kind of medication. ",5,1,4
"I've only been on this med for 4 days.  Dropped my BP from 150/105 to 117/78.  My BP has gone as low as 96/74 on this stuff.  I feel very lethargic, hard to get motivated to do anything but sleep.  Aches and pains on my left side particularly in my hand, leg, hip and collarbone.  A little bit of nausea and funny taste in my mouth.  No cough, but my sinuses are acting like I have a head cold (thick yellow mucus).  I am taking 10mg a day.  I think maybe 5mg would help - will ask Dr. to drop dosage or maybe I'll just chop my pills!",5,3,5

I started this drug recently and never got to see if it lowered my BP because the side-effects were so bad.  After 3 days taking the pills I experienced extreme bloated feelings with gas and abdominal pain. It lasted for 3 days in which time I didn't take the pills. I was also nauseated and couldn't swallow them.  Symptoms then resolved and I thought it was a stomach flu. I then started to take the Lisinopril again and after 2 more days became sick with the same severe stomach cramps with gas and this time vomiting. I immediately stopped and got better after a day or so.  I am now going to try something else.  Apparently my side effects only affect 2% of those taking it..Lucky me...=),4,1,1

Since I am on peritoneal dialysis and need to have uninterrupted sleep as much as possible, I plan to talk to my Dr. about taking another medicine.  I have taken many others without side effects like the cough.  It is embarrassing to be out in public, since I cough so hard that I sometimes leak urine.

"I went into the doctors office not expecting to hear that I have stage 2/3 hbp, and was very grateful that my doctor immediately took steps to put me on the medication. I've to say I always feared taking prescribed medications because I often feel as if they push you closer to ""the light"" but I'm happy my dr put me on the 10/12.5dose. I'venot tracked my bp, and i know i should, but i feel so much better since i've been taking itover the past 3 weeks. He did tell me about the possible side effects, and i've experience an occasional headache, but hey im in the land of the living. i also know that i need to do my part while taking this medication and start an exercise plan and make better food choices...oh and drink more water. I've not experienced the cough or the scratchy throat that i've often heard lots of people experience.

I also had mild muscle aches, blurred vision and dry coughing spells that I wrongly attributed to a cold or allergy but my doctor says this is a common side effect when the dosage is too high and he immediately lowered dosage to 5mg and sure enough most of the above symptoms went away.

Why can't I continue taking Lisinopril at a higher dose?  I don't want to start all over again trying to find out what dose is right for me or fearing to take this medication based on the side effects which really freaks me out.  Is changing my medication really necessary or it's their way of promoting a  product?",5,5,5

Before starting Lisinopril, my Dr. had me on Toprol XL which made me very tired and I was almost falling asleep in school.  Then I was put on another medication that gave me a bad cough.

"I have been on Lisinopril 10mg every morning for about one month.  Just recently got a refill for another month supply.  Noticed generalized itching over all my body and tingling sensation around my lips.  Feels like ants crawling over my body!  Did not connect symptoms with Lisinopril until today and reading the previous posts from others who have experienced similar symptoms. Also having muscle aches, leg cramps etc.  Called my insurance company and spoke with a nurse -- sounds like a typical allergic reaction -- why it did not surface and become more severe prior to this is a mystery to me, but I know I won't be taking any more of this medication or any other ACE inhibitor!  The itching is horrific!",5,2,3
"Was taking Coreg for elevated BP and because I had a stroke in a vein in my eye, but it wasn't lowering it enough-then added 10mg of Lisinoprol daily, which helped. My blood pressure was around 145 /90 with a pulse of 80-83.  In retrospect, I should have known something was wrong, but I have such bad airborn allergies that it didn't occur to me that the horrible coughing spells could be caused by something else. And, all I want to do is sleep. The headaches were so random that I thought it was because of my allergies.  We even bought two large room air cleaners for our bedroom and living room!  The urine leakage has been a nightmare,but I thought it was because of my age--my gynocologist suggested exercises to strengthen my abdominal muscles! Getting to sleep is hard and then the coughing wakes me up--so I thought that was what was causing me to feel tired all of the time. Lack of sleep. Because of an accident, I have been having physical therapy--and got seriously winded after only 6 minutes on the stationary bike.  If I bend over for too long I get so nauseated that I have to sit for awhile 'til it passes.  Today was my three months check-up with my Dr.and told him how I felt and that I had a cough that I couldn't shake, a weight on my chest, lethargy and that I felt overall terrible. That my mouth gets so dry at night, that I wake up gagging, if I'm not coughing! He stopped the lisenoprol--and I finally looked it up when I got home and found this site. I am in shock! I should have read the material more thoroughly when I first got the prescription. This is a lesson I won't have to learn twice! I have also had another stroke in my eye a week ago!  My doctor feels badly but all I want is to feel like my old self, the sooner the better. I am only 15 pounds overweight and 65 years old--but I feel 100 right now and depressed.  ",5,1,3

During the rainy season, I check out exercise DVD’s for “Baby Boomers” from the library to keep up my exercise regimen.

"Please bare with me as I make my case about Lisinoprol>>>Five days ago my doctor represcribed Lisinoprol and increased my dosage to 20 mg. He also changed an anxiety medication to Xanax XR. My doctor suggestted I lose a few pounds so, I started following a strict diet, exercising, gardening, etc. After 5 days, I've GAINED 5 POUNDS. I was sick of looking at my weight increase (despite my efforts), so I started doing research on all the prescribed meds I'm taking. I started with the anxiety med. While taking regular Xanax (which is addictive, but I have peace in my life again), I didn't gain any additional weight. I started reflecting on my time gardening today. After about an hour of gardening, my legs were so weak I could bare stand up, I felt lightheaded, my body was weak and my ankles were swollen.  When searching for the side effects of Lisinoprol, I was so disturbed. I was experiencing up to five symptoms at any given time. Also, I've been leaking urine without a full bladder and/or not having to go to the bathroom. My blood pressure has been elevated for over 10 years, but my doctor have some explaining to do. The side effects of this drug are serious and may have caused me to begin having anxiety attacks; I began having them about 2 - 3 years ago around the same time my doctor first began prescribing this med. I'm learning to question my doctor not only about the benefits of a drug, but also the possible side effects. Doctor's make mistakes. There was a serious mistake in my medical records in which he had to write an addendum for. I DO NOT recommend this drug.",4,1,1

"I was using Diovan & went into respiratory distress (also swelling of lips, face, neck & throat) and was then switched to 2-3 other drugs and now finally to Lisinopril 10mg for about a year.  Initially I had coughing during the day and night (not to the extreme where it kept me awake at night), but enough that I thought I had an allergy or common cold etc. and then after reading the information on this site I found that coughing is a common symptom with this drug.  I also had some muscle cramps in my feet and hands and some headaches too, but after including an hour of combined aerobics and stretching exercises 3-4 days/wk most of the symptoms have been reduced to the occasional headaches.  In a year’s time, I have lost about 35lbs, blood pressure & cholesterol levels are normal, and my doctor has recently lowered my dosage from 10 to 5mg.  ",5,3,4

"I've used this medication for about a year. At first I was on 10 mg. Then 20 mg, now 30 mg a day. Now it has lowered my blood pressure but after reading about others problems, I'm wondering if some of my other problems may have been caused by this medication. A year ago I had pains in my chest and had tests done including an angiogram. Showed some blockage and 1 leaky valve. Since than, I now have 3 leaky vales and heart rate was so low I had to have a pacemaker put in. I'm 54 years old and thought I was in basically good health. As far a Lisinopril, I had usual cough from it, started snoring, jaw cracking, irregular heart beats, depression that worsened with increased dosage and foot and leg cramping. Now I don't know how much Lisinopril had to do with that, however I cut back to 20 mg. and I'm starting to feel better. Now I will cut back to 10 mg. and then I'm going to get another medication.",4,1,3

Target is closer to me so I asked Target pharmacy would they “match” Wal-Mart’s offer and they accepted.   I now pay $10 for a 90 day supply of Lisinopril 10 mg which averages $3.33 per month.

"I am taking 10 mg once per day.  The only side effect I had was mild to modest headaches and mild vision blurring.  In an effort to reduce the headaches, I split the pill and took twice per day for about 6 months but my blood pressure lowered only a little.  But once my body became accustomed to the medicine, I can now tolerate taking it once a day per the doctor’s orders.  I am now on a modest diet plus 60 minutes of exercise 4 days per week, and the combination of all three is bringing my blood pressure down at a more modest pace.   ",5,3,4

"Although this brought my BP down quite well, I too experienced the problems with coughing that others have. On 2 occasions, I have woken up in the middle of the night, struggling to get my breath. I thought the first time, since I had a cold, that for some reason I closed my mouth during sleep and that's why I couldn't breathe. However, last night, I had a dream about not being able to get my breath, and woke up feeling that I had stopped breathing. I was gasping for air. I also noticed that my neck was swollen. Has anyone else had the problem of feeling like they have stopped breathing during sleep? This is really scary. ",4,1,4
I live in Michigan and recenly (12/07) started on generic lisinopril 10 mg from Meijer's (blue gray pill) manufactured by Watson LA with no side effects. Spent Jan 08 - Mar 08 in Florida and switched to Walgreen's lisinopril (pink pill) manufactured by Lupin.  Immediately within 1 week after beginning Walgreen's lisinopril experienced dry cough.  Upon returning to Michigan and switching back to Meijer's lisinopril dry cough stopped within 1 week. My recent visit to my doctor confirmed that lisinopril has lowered my BP and is working and I continue at 10 mg dossage. I talked with the Pharmacists at both Walgreens and Meijer's and neither could explain why one had dry cough side effect and the other did not.  The only difference is the pill color and manufacturer.,5,4,4

GROSS!! My Dr. had put me on Flagyl for the diarrhea, thinking I had an intestinal bacterial bug, but it made me completely stop for days. I stopped taking it for a day and later (literally) the water was back on. But, after seeing that that is one of the side effects, I'm stopping it and am now waiting to get in to see my Dr. I've never felt so aweful! ",5,1,3
After being on this medication I have had a very dry cough. I was first treated with other medication it did not help. They have finally but me on a different medication.

"This is a follow up to a previous rating I gave where I described my severe coughingas a result of taking lisinopri. This condition went on for over a month and has now subsided.  The doctor gave me allergy meications but apparently I never took them long enough.  She said you have to keep with it for a long time, maybe over a week to get relief.  So for those of you still afflicted by the cough try staying with some of the allergy meds.  For those of you who think you might have the coughing side effect be aware they last a long time.  I stopped taking lisinopril for three days thinking the coughing would stop and it didn't, so I resumed the dosage.  If you have that itchy throat you should probably stop right away.  ",1,1,1

Libido is non-existant. I will not take this medication any longer. This drug needs much more study in my opinion.

"WELL IT DID LOWER MY B/P ALONG WITH ATENOLOL BUT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON LISINOPRIL I HAVE NOTICED, MUSCLE ACHENSS, MUSCLE CRAMPS, RASH AND HEAD ACHES. SO I GUESS I WILL TALK TO THE DOCTOR TOMORROW AND SEE IF THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE HE CAN PUT ME ON AS THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE REALLY GETTING TO  ME... I WAS ON 2 ATENOLOL 200MG BUT IT DIDN'T DO THE JOB SO NOW I AM ON 100  AND 20 LISINOPRIL. SO WE WILL SE WHAT  HE HAS TO OFFER.  AND WHO SAID GETTING OLD WAS FUN..  ",1,2,3

"This medication is helping the high blood pressure,but I am diabetic and it has thrown my blood sugar out of whack so bad that I can't seem to keep it at the level it should be. Is there anything that will work and not spike my blood sugar?",4,1,4
"My dosage was extremely low at 5 mg, as my Dr. put it ""just a tiny little pill"". After using this for 6 weeks it has lowered my Bp to 128/73 from 138/90. Not a great accomplishment, but better. It seems to act as a diuretic. The problem has been that I developed strong pains during the night in my chest, very alarming. Also, discoloration and weakening of nails. Lastly, I awoke the other night with a bad chest pain and shortness of breath. I thought maybe having a stroke? EKG showed no circultory system damage, thankfully. The Dr. swithched my meds to Diovan 160 mg, and after 4 days I am experiencing lower back pain- I think I am stopping it. I've been on Biovaxine which has phitonutrients and Bp lowering nutrients. I will continue this holistic treatment as I have had only good effects using it for  10 days- same with everyone else I know.",4,1,4
Dramatic difference with virtually no side effects.,5,5,4

MY HEART KEPT BEATING HEAVY SO THE DOCTOR TOLD ME TO CUT THE PILL IN HALF, (HALF THE DOSE), BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT MAY BE LOWERING MY PRESSURE BY TAKING THE FULL 10MG. I AM ALSO EXPERIENCING A LACK OF SEXUAL ABILITY WITH THIS MEDICATION. I HOPE MY DOCTOR CAN TRY ME ON SOMETHING ELSE WHEN I GO TO SEE HIM. HAS ANYONE ELSE READING THIS EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS MEDICATION AND SEXUAL ABILITY?",3,3,4

ran out of medication due to shortage of money and didn't take for 4 days and I had a very very painful lower back ailment.  I am a insulin dependant diabetic.  Two days after resuming this medication my back ailment started getting better.,4,4,3
"Have had no problems with the medication, however, I have begun to have serious excema and I read a recent report of the med journal that said that calcium blockers can make this condition worse.  I never had it before, so I'm wondering if this medication falls into this category. Taking for high blood pressure.",5,4,5
seems to be working well,5,4,4
"It managed my blood pressure, but the coughing at night was terrible.  Didn't associate the two until I talked to my doctor about the cough.

"The medication was very effective in controlling my blood pressure.  However, I experience an uncontrollable cough at night and during the day. I have been switched to Diovan and I still have the cough after about 4 week.  I read that it can take months to get out of your system.  If you don't have the cough I would recommend the drug.

"Have Type 2 diabetes and started taking 20mg Lisinopril to lower BP. It immediately lowered BP. I have not had any problems with coughing like 7% of users do. However, I have immediately noticed a dramatic decrease in libido. I am in Weight Watchers and I have not had any difficulties losing weight while taking Lisinopril.",5,3,4
The medication is controling my blood pressure but I am experiencing a nagging cough during the daytime and at night.  I will ask the doctor to suggest another drug without the side effect of coughing.,5,2,3
"Since i got pregnant with my last son my blood pressure was really high like in the 180/100 range continually. Since i started on this med about 1 1/2 yrs ago its been really good. Down to the normal range. I have noticed a change in my libedo though like someone else had mentioned. I occasionally have a cough and never connected it until i started reading these reviews. I have also noticed a vast increase in weight gain and no matter how hard I try to lose weight, it just will  not come off. Didnt realize this was due to anything to do with med....thought it was just getting older and lower metabolism... hmmm got me thinking now.. but my blood pressure is great! ",5,5,5
"Lowered BP to normal within days. Mild coughing at night, but not constant. Worst side effect was weight gain/ plateau. Have been on weight watchers for a year and was losing @ 1 lb per week, until this medication. Because it lowers metabolism (I think), I have hit a plateau and am no longer losing like I was prior to meds.",5,4,4
"This man-made substance is chalky and hard to swallow, and makes me sluggish and dizzy.",3,1,3
"It has effectively lowered my bp to a safe normal range.  My ""only"" side effect I've experienced seems to be swollen eyelids, to the point that I have trouble putting on mascara. Don't know what to do about the swelling in the eyelids.  Any suggestions?",5,4,5
NEW DRUG FOR ME,5,1,1
"Am taking  10 mg once a day for BP- it worked okay, taking it down from  160/100 to 130/85. It's been about 6 months now. For me, the occasional cough isn't that bad. My libido seems  a little weak however. ",5,4,4
"My 75 year old mother began using this medication and after approximately 2 months she suddenly experienced a serious swelling of her tongue and throat.  We rushed her to the hospital where she ended up in ICU.  Has been difficult reducing the swelling.  Very scary.   About 5 years ago, I also was on this medication for some months when I experienced losing ability to taste and then acute swelling of my face.  Ended up in emergency.  Very allergic to this medication even though it seemed to be effedtive for my blood pressure.  ",5,1,5

I have been taking lisinopril for 2 and one half years. Started on 10mg but was very lethargic and was falling asleep in the mid-afternoon. Started to daily monitor my BP; very low 85 over 60. Had dosage changed to 5mg and BP is now normal. Sometimes a dry cough but not often. Also sometimes itchy skin at night. No pain in joints.

This med is not working for me.  need new prescription.  Am glad to hear from other people and to know that the coughing could be due to lisinopril and that there is hope.  i have been dreading sleep for weeks now.  ",4,1,2

This lowered my blood pressure immediately and got rid of my headaches.  but now i am so tired I can't stay awake. Not sure what to do. Also have dry cough at night. ,5,4,5
"I took one dose of this drug at about 5:30 in the evening. I felt fine until I woke up the next morning (5:15 AM) lightheaded, nauseous, and extemely tired. I slept until 2:30 PM. My prescription was changed to Benicar. I've been on Benicar for 4 days with only a dry cough.",5,1,1

So please be advised. Wishing you better luck.",4,3,3
I was taking another drug for B/P but with no insurance was very costly so my M.D. switch med to lisinopril 40 mg. not as effective and until I read the reviews wasn't sure why I suddenly developed a deep dry cough with no other symtoms NOW I KNOW>>> guess I will be trying something else!!!!!!,5,3,3

Once the skin in scratched or rubbed in any way, huge welts appear.  Not sure if this is from this med, but seeing md to have it checked out.

"Two weeks after my heart attack, I took this medication without eating.  It caused me to ""crash"" or ""bradying down"" and I was rushed to the ER and underwent another angioplasty.

My doc either didn't care is too underpaid to notice that apparently these are all some pretty bad side affects. I would rather have high b.p than cough all day and night-I work in a hospital too, so everyone i come in contact with thinks that I'm spreading sickness, when it's just this bothersome side-effect.

This med. did make my blood pressure decline after two weeks.  I was on lisinopril for three months as a teenager. I had to go back on lisinopril or enalapril a few times after starting college because it was hard to keep my bp low without the med. Guess I can't beat my genes without ACE Inhibitors.",5,4,4

Then WHAM --late August or early September I began this dry, hacking cough which has progressed to TERRIBLE gut-wrenching spasms, occuring at least every 2-3 hours during day, and getting me up several times through night; cough so hard I almost vomit..Also--Muscle spasms & cramps below rib cage, abdomen, legs & feet.  Ankles & feet swelling when I sit or stand any length of time---Runny nose that Claratin, etc. do not help at all--so weak & tired can't do my exercises as needed...and to top it off, am having extreme body heat & cold sweats practically all day and till late at night....I see my doctor again next week and I am absolutely refusing to take any more of this medicine.

"I started taking 50 mg of Metoprolol daily in February 2016. Back then I was a 68 year old male in good health except for high blood pressure. In March 2017 I began to develop the first signs of PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s disease. They were painful erections, curvature of erect penis and the presence of a structure inside the penis. The structure was plaque and I could feel it inside the soft penis. I went to three urologists. They all said I had PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s disease and to do nothing because it might go away. It slowly got worse up to the present time. I googled Ã¢Â?Â?PeyronieÃ¢ 94;?Â?s and MetoprololÃ¢Â?Â and came up with two scientific articles linking PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s to Metoprolol. I then examined the the WebMD data on Metoprolol and saw as one of the side effects of Metoprolol Ã¢Â?Â?PeyronieÃ¢ 94;?Â?s diseaseÃ¢Â?Â. I immediately stopped taking the drug. That was yesterday, October 12, 2018. I am hopeful that the PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s will disappear. I will report back here in three months.",3,1,3

After 1 month I started 1.5 for 5 minutes 1.8 for 5 minutes 2.0 for 20 minutes.  Everyday. After 3 months the palapatations stopped.  I walk everyday for this 30 minutes. I cut back on sugar, stopped Tylenol and anything I was taking at night to help me sleep as o read these effect the heart also.  I think itâ??s the steady treadmill that works and not sure just walking outside would . Ask your doctor if healthy enough to walk on treadmill.

Recently my pharmacy changed their supplier for metoprolol and within 4 days I became symptomatic- extreme fatigue, breakthrough tachycardia, irregular heartbeat.  Had to locate another pharmacy that carries the original supplier of my med.  Has anyone else had this issue?  Iâ??m guess Iâ??m just real sensitive to the manufacturer of this product.  ",4,4,4

First it was nausea and loss of appetite, then wanting to sleep in the daytime (I never do this), no energy at all, couldn't accomplish anything, anxiety, and felt this way for 3 weeks before it dawned on me it might be the change in blood pressure meds. Wheen I looked up side effects of this drug I knew it was not for me. Am back on Atenolol which had been discontinued manufacturing and already feeling better.

Awful. After that it seemed to help for a few months...and then didn't. And then my hair started falling out. My doctor thought I was iron deficient, I was not iron deficient. Turns out it's this horrible medication. So now I have even MORE anxiety and have to fix all the other problems it's caused me. My doctor switched me to Amlodipine and Celexa, stopping the Metoprolol cold turkey (although I questioned it and was told it would be fine). Big mistake. Huge. Got to work and thought I was having a heart attack. Ended up in urgent care and then the ER. Now tapering off like I should have in the first place and it hasn't been pleasant. I can't wait until this poison is out of my system. I'm already noticing my hair isn't falling out like it was. I don't know if this works for other people but I will never go near it again.

Have reduced to 1X day, and will start half tab, then stop.  I had been doing 2 1/2 mile walk daily, and had to completely stop due to foot pain. Will see Cardiologist in 1 wk.  I blame symptoms on addition of metoprolol. Also 3 years have been on Arimidex and  2 weeks Xarelto , which can cause similar side effects.

Can't use the right word for things when telling someone about it, even though I know what it is. It comes back to me later. Same with people's names.

At 1:30 I took my regular dose of metoprolol 25mg and within 30 minutes coughing my head off again.  I find it very upsetting that the cardiologist and primary drs do not talk to each other and put us in the middle going back and forth. Metoprolol does cause severe cough in some people!!!",5,1,5

"Lethargic, hard to focus memory problems, much reduced energy and I am ordinarily a high energy individual. My son-in-law took the medication and said he had the same symptoms. I had a stroke!! I was convinced it was caused by this drug. I did some research with my pharmacist and my endocrinologist. This drug crosses the brain.  I asked my neurologist to change me to atenolol which does not cross the brain and all of the above symptoms have gone but it took a year to get it out of my system and I began to feel normal again. I am doing fine on the atenolol but it is not slow release. I am taking the drug because I was diagnosed in my 30's with premature ventricular contractions. I took no meds for it until I was 65 and the symptoms became more pronounced, 18,000 dropped heartbeats within 24 hours. My sister has been diagnosed with the same thing so I think it was inherited. The medication controls the pvc's but I have trouble with a slow heart rate, the case all my life,  and I can only take 25mg. THE CROSSING OF THE BRAIN OF THIS DRUG WAS VERIFIED BY MY ENDROCOLOGIST.

Seems like just can not clearly think anymore. Very scary. I am currently 63 years old and everyone telling me I'm just getting old, it's normal. Maybe, but I just requested my doctor take me off of the medication. Going back to Bystolic 5 Mg ASAP and will pay the extra cost. ",4,1,4

I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape. I steadily gained weight, assumed it was age. Exercising felt impossible. After a year or so, I was also having afternoon hypotension upon standing quickly. I developed symptoms of asthma, wheezing and chest tightness   severe fatigue. Reported my symptoms finally, and I was switched to Diltiazem. After 8 days of body adjustment (w/small amount of Ativan a few nights to control anxiety), I again felt human. Exercise is now more efficient. In my case, It was a direct switch from one med to the other. Yes, I think I had some adjustment coming off metroprolol- headache, chills, uneasiness, muscle cramps, a little heart pounding, slightly higher pulse rate (no pvcs however), and bp went up about 10 points (not a big issue for me). All the symptoms of having too much adrenalin. I took it easy that first week- low exertion, low stress (well, that is debatable- election week), .25 to .5 mg Ativan at night the first 4 nights or so. By 1st day, better breathing. By 8 days, I felt much better overall. 120 mg Diltiazem ER has not produced any noticeable adverse effects for me, at least, at this point. I'm 41, a divorced mom of 4, I usually walk now about 10,000 steps every day, and I'm about 40 lbs overweight (so happy to be able to work on this now :) Good luck! Hang in there. Talk to your doctor and ask for help when you need it.",3,1,3

Worst was insomnia almost every night. Also had gastro-intestinal issues, flatulence, confusion, memory issues, increased sweating.

I am otherwise healthy and active.  Upside: Symptoms are largely gone now.  Also has a calming effect.  Downside: less energy, hair loss and change in hair texture, occasional numbness in fingertips when cold.  Don't like the side effects, but better than scary rapid heartbeat.",5,4,5

I never thought of this coming from this medicine but I know it has caused my memory loss, which is so darn bad I was thinking I have dementia.

I didn't have high BP till I took this medicine now if I miss a pill within a couple hours I will have a 139/70 reading with a 100 pulse. I am going to try to get off of it if it doesnt kill me.

During these episodes I constantly felt lightheaded, was very tired, my ankles would swell up, and constantly had to urinate. No matter how I complained about it I was not taken off of this drug. Of course, I'm with the VA. They never listen to the patient. It wasn't until I got off of Metropolol and began taking d-Ribose that everything began to calm down.

I get worried when I 'm getting low on pills. Your body gets used to blocking the adrenaline effects on your heart so when the drug wears off it causes a rebound tachycardia or a very fast heart rate to occur.

Now after taking it for a month I developed major constipation and chest congestion. So now I'm having to bite the bullet and go back to the real Toprol XL.

Never had any major health problems short of a torn ACL/MCL few yrs back.   I'm a normal, healthy guy.  Doc put me on this stuff couple wks ago since my BP had been creeping up the last few visits.  I FEEL LIKE I'M LOOSING MY MOTHERFRAPPING MIND!!!!!!!  Constant ringing/""static"" in my ears...  calves/thighs been cramping (aka ""charlie horse"") like crazy... head's been kinda... ""swimmy""???  Kinda light headed or foggy???  But by far the worst, most maddening side effect is the GOTDAM TINGLING IN MY TOES!!!!!!!  Jeeeeezus, I can't stand it.  It's like my toes/feet and falling asleep and there's that tingling, numbing, sandy feeling.  ALL.  THE.  TIME.  I think I'd rather be impotent.  Yeah, that's how bad the tingling is.  To clarify the one 5 star rating, of course it's ""easy to use"", it's  a pill.  Gulp it on down.  Bottom line, me and this med don't get along.  If you're having similar side effects, you're not loosing it, they're for real.  Me, I'm get'n another HBP med.  ",5,1,1

Increased to 25 mg.for past year I am extremely tired can't walk daily which I love to do.  The 25 mg. also brings my blood pressure down too low as I had no real problem with blood pressure to begin with.  My doctor thinks I should try a calcium channel blocker instead but they have the same side effects.  I have been to cardiologists and electrophysiologists and no one can tell me why I have pacs.  Very upset with the medical profession!!!!!!!,4,2,4

No advice every given by cardiologist about diet, exercise, stress, no monitoring of other health problems other than heart which affect her taking such meds.

"Take 200mg at bedtime.  Started at 100mg but was moved to 200.  At that level it controlled my BP very well with consistent readings of 120-125 over 69-72 & pulse of 69.  Dr. added Benicar HCT 40/12.5 to get ride of ankle/feet swelling.  No change in diet required other than to be reasonable.  However, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about a year ago, so I started taking Metformin 500 mg.  Needed to increase that to 1000mg--taken after dinner.  Diabetes is under control but the Metformin has raised my BP dramatically so Lisinopril has also been added.  The best we've able to do is readings of 137/52 fairly consistently but at times is in the 140s with bottom # still in 50s.  Top # just won't come under control. My cholestrol went through the roof as did my triglycerides--all bec. of the Metformin & diabetes.  We've now added Tricor and Pravastatin to control these two new conditions which helped.  I'm frustrated bec. all these new health problems have come about bec. of the diabetes and Metformin.  I don't know what to do.  It's very depressing.  Maybe all the medications contribute to that.

"Have pacemaker, cardiologist said there showed a glitch in the heart rhythm on 2 occasions.  Switched from Cardura to Metoprolol.  Advised doctor that because of allergies, I cannot take generics. He insisted that I start with it, and could switch to Brand if a problem.  11 days into starting it, muscle pain, joint pain, went from driving car to walking with walker and assistance.  Could not sleep at night, had violent dreams, woke up feeling distressed.  Switched to Brand name Toprol XL, after 5 days symptoms were worse. Legs had reduced in size about 1/4. Muscle pain getting worse. Went back to doctor, he took me off by halving the tablet for several days, then started back on Cardura.  I have researched the fillers used in drugs that I have had problems with, and am convinced that the fillers are the main problems for me.  Once I get this out of my system, I might try the Brand Toprol XL again.  For right now, I'm trying to get back on my feet and be able to drive and start walking again.  Still have a lot of pain. I've been told that there is no difference in generic and Brand by doctors, nurses, pharmacists.  All one needs to do is get the ingredients in generics and Brand, and compare the two.  You may have allergies to fillers in generics.",1,1,1

"Although ToprolXL lowered my BP the over riding comment I make is  the side effect...hair loss ...there is no mention made from the doctor when prescribing it, NOR the pharmacist...nor from the mail order provider.  This is an outrage.  I  contacted the pharmacutical company , received no answers to my question such as ""is this side effect reversible?""  Will my hair ever grow back?  Who can answer this question from patients?  Don't we have the right to receive an answer? This is not life threatening...but it is pathetic. ",3,1,3

"I have borderline HBP and an irregular heartbeat.  Started with one 25mg pill a day, then a pill and a half, and now I'm up to two pills.  That seems to be controlling the irreg hb and my bp is good.  Main side effect is I sweat like a pig all day long, which I didn't do before starting on it.  I also am not sleeping as well now that I'm up to 50mg a day.  The other side effect is weird dreams.  They aren't nightmares, just weird stuff.  I'm gaining weight too.  Will talk with my dr at my appt this month, but I was wondering if anyone else had the sweating issue, and if so what did they do about it?

I am now taking Norvasc which lowers my blood pressure better than metoporal did and I seem to have no side effects.   After reading about all the other people who have had problems with this drug I don't know why doctors still prescribe it other than the fact that it's cheap. Watch yourself very carefully for side effects when taking this drug.  Be aware and be careful.  There are lots of other drugs out there that also lower your blood pressure and are much safer to take. ",5,1,3

"Been taking this medication for about 3 weeks and into my 2nd week I started feeling, I think, some side effects will confirm with my doctor. Been having slight diarrhea, a little tingling in my hands and sinus drainage, mood is down. Overall, my BP has been excellent, below 120/80, average 116/75. I'm taking 25mg, 1 time a day. I was diagnosed in the prehypertention stage and my goal is to drop weight, eliminate stress, and change my eating habits to focus on my salt intake. I hate taking meds and would rather change my lifestyle, meds come with too many side effects that slow me down.",5,3,5
"I went online to research the side effects and found many people taking this medication have similar side effects, and am asking my doctor to switch me off of it. About 1 week ago I started taking 50 mg time released formula everynight for high bp 160/100.  I began to notice a single slight pinch type feeling in my upper chest area about 15-30 minutes after taking it, along with a feeling of fullness in chest around bra strap thought it was my bra being to tight but when I paid attention several days times later it was shortness of breath which remined me of how I felt when I had phnuemonia (sp?) a long time ago I didnt pay either much attention, until I also noticed occassional blurred vision when eatting supper, got up next morning my leg muscle ached like I'd run a marthanon without any excercise. Since starting this medication I havent had a good nights sleep I  found  myself laying awake at night unable to go to sleep although I was so sleepy I couldn't hold my eyes open, until I got into bed. I also have noticed my facial skin especially cheeks,chin, although I use lotions scalp and inside of ears are itchy dry and flakey reminds me of psorasis (sp?) I had as a child. Along with stuffy nose which seems to hit about the same time everyday. Last night when I couldnt sleep I got out my patient advisory sheet from the pharmacy and read about many of these symptoms and that to go off this medication it must be tappered am calling doctor.

"Hi,  I am a 26 year old female that was diagnosed with severe heart palpitations, high blood pressure and tachachardia all at the same time...it was nothing for my heart rate to get up to 140 b/p/m SITTING STILL! Any physical activity at all and i felt like i was going to pass out! My heart was also palpitating just every few minutes. I was SO SCARED i was gonna have a heart attack or worse. I am also an insulin dependant diabetic since I was 8. The drs put me through EVERY test in the book, holter monitors, lab work, ekg, echocardagrams, stress test and even a heart catherization in July of this year. They could not find ANYTHING wrong with my heart! My cardioligist said I had the heart of a 16 year old! I changed from a very active person to a couch potato because i was so scared something was going to happen to me! I developed severe panic attacks and depression and was afraid to be alone even for short periods of time. My blood pressure was also running high like 140 or 150 / 90's to 100's. They started me out on Diltiazem which did me absolutely NO good and caused me to feel very tired and sleepy all the time! Then they tried me on bystolic which i had an allergic reaction to and thought my throat was going to completely close up! Then they put me on Metaprolol 50mg tablets once in the morning. I have been on this pill since October. So far the ONLY side effect that I have is that my ankes are swelling pretty bad. It has dropped my blood pressure to like 117/60 or 70 and has dropped my pulse rate to like 70-80. It has also made my heart palpitations very few and far in between! I have NOTHING bad to say about this drug except that is has made my feet swell but I can deal with that verses living every day being petrified that something is gonna happen to me! I am supposed to go to my family dr. to probably get put on a low dose water pill for the swelling! This drug has REALLY helped me! ",5,4,5
If I forget to take my daily dose.  I develope a headache which reminds me real quick that I forgot to take my pill.  :),4,4,4

"I take 3 BP meds. Amlodipiine, Lisinopril and this one Metoprolol.I am narrowing it down to this one right now because I have developed painful, swollon toes and feet, with some swelling of my ankles. I thought I had or have Gout. So Dr. put me on 2 other meds for Gout now. I am going back to the name brand to see if that has the same reaction on me. A close friend of mine also takes this med. and developed Gout in her ankle and couldn't walk. One day we were discusing our meds and we decided it might be the Generic side effects. So we did our own resurch and found these happenings between the both of us.",4,2,4

I've been on this medication for 3 months and I'm now gaining weight even though I'm continuing to exercise at the same rate. For the first 2 weeks after starting this medication I had horrible muscle spasming in my back, legs and arms, but this has stopped. After reading all of the previous comments I think it might be better to try naturopathic medicine.

Lisinopril was so fantastic, and my doc is so convinced that my little cough which was already proven to be from asthma during the winter-so she won't let me have it anymore! Dumb. I'll change doctors and tell them I'm taking Lisinopril just to get what I need!  Plus, the cost of this is a $30.00 copay vs. the Lisinopril at $4.00 a month--who's kidding whom doc?

It makes it extremely difficult for me to focus & concentrate at work (I have a very high-level position)and also wipes me out completely so that I'm nearly falling asleep at my desk.  It doesn't matter when I take it (morning, noon, night, whenever) I still experience the same thing.",5,2,4

I checked all other possibilities and finally reverted to the Atenolol, and the taste and feeling has gone away.

Called my doctor for a new pill and I am now on Toprol XL (brand name not generic)50mg twice a day.  Still adjusting to this medication with some side effects but a tleast no nausea.

First, The mfg. has issued a recall on this med due to ""problems"" in quality control and mfg. standards. Google this med for full details. Sounds like this med was made in the peanut plant to me!

"My doctor added Metoprolol Succ XL 50 MG as a second drup to my Diovan HCT 25 MG.  I was  feeling fine with the combination my blood pressure is controlled. Stress/anxiety/tiredness/lack of sleep sometimes contributes to a spike in my blood pressure. In the end of February 2009, Walgreens had a shortage of the drug.  Walgreens called my doctor that I will be getting Metoprolol Tartate 25MG which I have to take 2X a day. When my doctor's nurse called me of the change in the drug, I did not think anything about it. I picked up my Metoprolol Tartate 25MG from Walgreens and try to take 2X a day. The problem is taking the second pill. I take the first pill at 6:30AM by 3:00PM I am feeling tightness/discomfort on my left should all the way down to my arms.  I then take the second pill. The discomfort I am experiencing continues and my diastolic is way up 100. I ceased activity and rested but the discomfort continued. I called my doctor and she tells me to come in and get a stress test.  I was expecting she'll make the connection to the change of the drug - but NO. My doctor said there is nothing she can do because the drug is unavailable. I get a call from my doctor's nurse and instructed me to go to OSCO.  Sure enough only Walgreens supplier is having problems.  My problem here is this.  What is Walgreens Ethical Responsibility in telling Walgreens customers that the drug is available in other pharmacies.  What right does Walgreens have in making arrangements with the Doctor to change the drug just because Walgreens does not carry it anymore and does not know when they will have a supply available.  Could Walgreens have just said that the drug is not available at Walgreens but that the customer can check other pharmacies in the area?  My doctor is not even informed of the shortage/recall-etc. I had a bad experience with the change from Metoprolol Succ XL 50MG to Metoprolol Tartate 25MG in the 2weeks I was taking it. Physicians should be more informed of the drugs.",3,3,2

"I was taking a generic form of this drug for over a year as a beta blocker for an irregular heartbeat.  The pharmacy's supplier changed generic companies, and I ended up with a different pill.  This pill caused massive side effects.  My shoulders started feeling as if there was a weight on them, and my large muscles in my body started feeling as if they were perminately cramped.  I had to stop taking it for three days, and the sysmptoms slowly subsided.  I called the pharmicists and explained what was happening. She filled my RX with the generic I'd been taking, and within two weeks my muscles are almost back to normal.  In short, if one generic causes a side effect... try another.  It may be fillers that cause the doseage to effect you differently no matter what the manufacturers say.  (A friend of mine had an allergic reaction to a generic of a medication she'd been on for three years.  They gave her the generic she'd been on, and she was FINE.

"I was taking Toprol XL 25 for palpatations. When the generic came out made by Par, I switched to that for 5 years. I recently moved & had to get my prescription at CVS.  After picking it up, I called CVS to ask why the shape of the pill was now round instead of oval.  They said it was because it was made by a different manufacturer, Ethex.  After take the Ethex pill for 3 nights, I woke up in the middle of the 3rd night to go the bathroom, walked a few steps, got very dizzy and fainted.  I lost consciousness for maybe 2 seconds.  I hit my arm against my dresser & my leg & was black and blue for a couple of weeks.  I fell very softly.  I went back to sleep & when I woke up in the morning, my blood pressure was 90 over 60, very low.  I then called CVS & asked them about the Ethex pill.  He said it differers from the ones made by Par 'cause it has fillers.  I spoke to my pharmacist on Long Island where I had moved from & he said that sometimes the fillers that are in some pills make the pills a bit more potent, & if that's the case, I was taking more than 25 mgs. of the medicine.  CVS doesn't carry Par so now I had to go to another drug store & since Par was on back order, I had to order the non-generic Torprol XL 25 & pay a lot more.  I want to know why there isn't a warning on the Ethex drug.  I did research on line & there are many Ethex drugs that are being pulled from shelves not by the FDA but by patients that have complained about them. Now I have 87 Motoprolol pills that can't be returned.  I think something should be done about this to avoid future problems.  What would have happened if I were driving? Thank you!

"Run as far away from this drug as you can!!!  I thought I was going to die on this medication.  My dr. prescribed it after several meds were not effective in lowering my BP.  Not only did this medication raise my BP to 200 over 110, but there were so many side effects that I became a different person.  I was severly depressed, cried for no reason, could not walk without being out of breath, my heart actually hurt, all I wanted to do was sleep.  However, when I woke up one day with burning in my chest like my inside was on fire, I knew it was time to get off of it.

I have not taken the medication for the last two days and I have all of a sudden realized how bad I was feeling while on the generic.

As will any medication, some people cannot tolerate the side effects.  I have gained 15 pounds, and it's difficult to loose.  Being 50 years old doesn't help weight loss either, although it is still possible.  I have read that for some people the Toprol XL works better for with fewer possible side effects.  Toprol XL is the brand name for the generic metoprolol.  It is more expensive and insurance companies may give resistance.  Overall, metoprolol has worked very well for me.",5,4,5

"My first medication for my high BP was Toprol XL, whick I had been taking for some years. Insurance switched it to Metoprolol SUCC ER.  I have gradually noticed my BP increasing and am having mild depression.  Yesterday, during an ENT appt. the nurse took my BP and it was 160/100.  I was shocked, and then I started my research.  My pharmacist said she has recently seen patients having problems with their BP increasing and had to go back to Toprol XL.  I am convinced that is my problem also.  This change occured over many months.  The pharmacist said the difference is in the ""binder"" they use for this drug. I will see my Doctor first thing Monday, to get me off this, and back on Toprol XL. It will take a letter/call from him to convince insurance the drug is failing me.",3,1,1

I'm also having trouble with the generic brand.",4,1,2
I started the generic form 2-3 mo. after mitral valve repair surgery. During cardiac rehab my resting heart rate was in the low 100's. I have been taking 1/2 of 25 mg. for 1yr. hoping my heart rate would slow down as my heart healed. I have tried several times to not take it and noticed an uncomfortably high heart rate at rest. No problems with it except that I have not been able to lose 15 lbs. that I put on after surgery even though I have been watching my caloric intake and excercising with a personal trainer 3 times a week for 8 mo. I also hoped my energy level would have been a bit better by now. I am 48 and in perfect health otherwise. I will call my cardiologist and try hard to get off of it.I hope that does the trick because summer is coming.,5,4,5

I use to feel ""reved"". I do have some nausea, but it doesn't last long. I was on it last summer and my doctor's did not tell me to decrease it slowly and in the heat of summer I had the potential of fainting. Well, that happened. When the bottle was empty, I did not know it was to be filled, my doctor was not monitoring me well enough, even though my BP's were through the roof. It caused me to go into severe tachycardia and arryrhytmia's. So BEWARE, be your own advocate. Talk to your pharmacisit, or look things up on Web MD. That was a too close of a call for me and I am only 46 years old.",5,4,4
"Since taking this drug, I have been obsessed with thoughts of death, dreams of death and dying, sweating, pulsating in my head non-stop, and headaches.

"I have been on metoprolol for about a month. At first, my muscles hurt and was fatigued in the afternoons. That went away and has helped my BP but I have almost daily I have headaches and light-headness. I hope it goes away soon...Any ideas that can help with headaches or light-headness?? PDQ",5,3,3
"The generic versions of metoprolol are not the same as the branded Toprol XL.  The time release mechanism does not work properly, causing extreme fatigue cycling with chest palpitations, increased blood pressure, and headache.  All of these occured when I was switched from the genuine Toprol to the generic.  When I returned back to the Toprol, these severe side effects went away.  Please beware of the generic versions of metoprolol.",3,1,1

I have been on the generic for about 2 months and will see the Dr. again and ask if anything is supposed to happen? I still feel faint when I stand up, dizzy when I lean over and tired all the time.

I have been on Metoprolol since June 07 for severe PAC's and PVC's.  To the point I wanted to dig my heart out of my chest to make the bugs stop crawling.  I have had tremendous relief. My BP has dropped a lot but it is still within low limits range of 90/50.  The PAC's were so bad I was a danger to drive as things would go black momentarily.  This has been a blessing to stop them.,4,4,4

I also have had times when my heart races as though I'm not taking any medication at all. The increased sweating has also caused fungal problems like athletes foot and jock itch.,5,1,1
"I am another victim from this drug...this time Walgreens too.  I was in tropol for a year, week ago I went to Walgreen for my refill and they gave me this new generic.

This pill defenitly is not good at all. My doctor asked me to stop it inmediatly and today I have to see him.  One  of my co-workers told me that she is in tropol...when she tryed the Metoprorol Succinate started having arritmia and the doctor have to talk to her insurance to put her back in Tropol. So think about it before taking this medication...I don't want nobody to go thru this situacion.,1,1,1
"Walgreens switched my tropol for metoporol er...I don't know but it doesn't work the same. I think the ER should means eight release (hours) because the effect only last 8 hours on me. before the change i used to take half tablet of 25mg of tropol and I was doing good, now I'm taking the whole pill (25 mg) and i feel fatigue, tired...must be something wrong with this new metoporol...try not to switch....try to stay with the brand one.

Back to my old routine of feeling fatigue and just wanting to sleep on the couch after work nothing else. Going to call the Dr. in the morning to complain. That is why I went online here to check it out. Now, I see all these other people complaing of fatigue just reinfores what I felt all alone that the pills were negatively affecting me.",1,1,2

Now on Diovan which has been less syptomatic, but still have some reaction ( Diarheaa).  She tells me that all meds cause some reaction. But glad I am off Metoprolel.  Topryl XL was good but kept having to increase dose..",2,1,2
I was given this medication when I had a triple by-pass and aortic valve replacement surgery.  It controls my rapid heart beat.,5,5,5
"I was on ToprolXL for years, with no problems. The pharmacy changed me to this Rx and I began having depression, nightmares, heart palps at night and fatigue. I went to my doc; after several tests/screens/blood panels, my heart is within normal limits, my BP is normal, but because of the palps at night and the fatigue, he is switching me back to Toprol. He said the Met is metabolized differently than the Toprol which makes it less effective toward the end of each cycle. ",3,1,2
This drug is terrific at lowering my B.P. but has made me depressed & fatigued bigtime.  Guess the benefit has outweighed the side effects but I don't feel like my old self anymore.,5,3,5

I couldn't figure out if it was something else I had changed, like detergent or lotions.  My eye lids also have been very irrated and red.

"I was on Toprol XL. My pharmacy starting giving me the Metoprolol XL. I started having the same fatige problem I had several years ago with the standard Metoprolol. Also, I did not feel it was controling my BP thru a 24hr period. I went back to the Torpol XL and feel 100% better.

"When I first took this drug Micardis HCT I cut it in half, which worked well for me.  It was too strong at 12.5.  My doctor agreed because my blood pressure went down.  I have been on it for 4 months and now am experiencing joint pain in my hips which radiates to my knee, calf muscle stiffness,a rash on the outside of my armpits and itchy skin on my thighs.  I have been on many BP meds.  My Dr. said I have to over look the side effects.  My Bp is 122/64 most of the time. It is driving me crazy!  Everyone has different reactions to this drug, but I am seeing a pattern through the reviews on Web MD.  I am glad I am not the only one with these problems.",5,2,3

"Have been on this med for a number of years.  It has lowered my bp from approx. 145/90 to 125/80.  Not great but not bad.  I take 80/12.5.  But as some other reviewers have said, I've had many symptoms that I hadn't been attributing as side effects of this med, but may well be: nagging dry hacking cough (the worst symptom), sleep problems, lethargy, depression, weight gain, vision deterioration, sinus and nasal congestion, closed throat (when I get a cold, I can't breathe through my mouth when my nose is clogged up and I'm afraid I'll suffocate), hair thinning, diarrhea almost every morning.  And one big thing.  I had never had a problem with my kidneys in my life, and last year I developed an enormous kidney stone - the Urol. said it was the biggest he's ever seen.  So beware of anything with the kidneys. You should also know that there is now a so-called ""generic version"" of this: telmisartan-hydrochlorothiazide, but my side effects have gotten much worse in the two weeks I've been on it. I will have to get my doctor to change my medication, because now that it is available in generic, the insurance company probably won't let me go back to the name brand.  I hate the individual blister packs too.  Why can't they just put them in a bottle?",2,2,2
Was on this medication over ten years.  My hair start falling out in the last two yrs.  I c/o to my Dr. about palpitation that I believe was related to this medication. I even went to ER.

"HBP was the first of my ""old age"" conditions diagnosed. I have been taking it about 10 years. It seems to maintain a steady BP for me. If I have any side effects it would be occasional dizziness, and occasional diarrhea. These are tolerable compared to others.  The concern I have with this brand is that there is no generic equivalent so it is the most expensive of my drugs; even with company paid insurance, my cost just went up another $25 per 90-day supply and I am considering changing drugs because of the cost.",5,5,5

I developed hives while on this drug.(40/12.5 mg twice a day) Also short periods of very low BP. I felt ill each morning after taking the first dose of the day. This ill feeling would last for 3 hours or so. Discontinued all BP meds and controlling BP through exercise. Current average is 126/80. My fasting sugar level increased while on this drug and it has not returned to normal after nearly four weeks without using it. I will not use this drug again.,2,1,4
"Since I have been on Micardis, my blood pressure has dropped drastically....My numbers have gone from 150/104 to 118/77....and I have lost almost 8 lbs. in about 4 weeks....",5,5,5
"I've had high blood pressure for about 25 yrs.  in early 2007 a 6 1/2 cm tumor on left adrenal gland was found and removed.  The adrenal gland has a big influence on blood pressure.   Over the yrs I have found that: 1 - if on more than 2 differnet BP drugs, see a kidney specialist.  They are the true BP experts. 2 - If you develope a cronic cough, it can be your BP meds, expecially Ace Inhibitors. 3- I'm on Coreg and Micardis now and they are working for me.  I've tried the generic Coreg twice and BP went up, so generics don't always work.  4- Micardis, the small pills are very  hard to open.  I've recently been switched to the larger 80mg time release pill and they are much easier.   However, not sure they are going to work as well as the 40 mg twice a day.  Insurance co made my doc switch me.  We may have to fight it, if my pressure continues to be higher from time to time.    5 - It's important to take your BP medicine.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor to try something else.  Not all drug work for everyone.  It's often trial and error at times to find the right ones for you.   Also what works great for a while may stop working.  ",3,5,5

Doc first prescribed 25 mg hydrochlorathiazide and had severe fatigue/muscle weakness. Switched to Micardis with 12.5 mg HCT and now BP is under control and energy/muscle strength is good.  I'm taking an electrolyte/potassium supplement.  Doc needs to submit extra approval for insurance to cover this.,5,3,5
"Overall, ""benefits outweigh side effects"" for me. About 1x/wk, I experience numbness in middle three fingers on both hands (turn white) and fingers/toes lose sensation quicker in cold weather---but not a big deal. Also, I have NEVER been able to rise early but I am popping out of bed 2 hrs earlier than my previous wakeup time! I do experience fatigue later in day. I might try something w/o diuretic as I can't seem to pass up a bathroom now.   Packaging: I had brain lock at first but now find it easy to open.  Price: recommend you get ""Mycard"" discount card from Dr if you don't have; saves me about $40/mo, I think. Pain to enroll (15 min on phone for me) but worth it.",5,4,5
My pressure was high and I could not get it under control. This medication quickly got it under control and me in control of my life again.,4,4,4
"Dr prescribed this drug for BP. I took this for 5 months did not like what was happening.  I advised my Dr. that my hands were always numb and tingling when I woke up.  He attributed this to my many years of computer work.  So I continued for 2 more months until I could not hold my cup, bowl or anything until about 2 hours after I was up and about.  I am only 53 not 93. I told him I am not taking this drug anymore.  After 3 months the numbness and tingling has gone.  My bp is very good.  I only take caduet and that is working just fine.  Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands.",3,2,3
Was taking Norvasc for years and had 3 surgeries on my gums.  Now starting micardis. Hope it works,2,2,4
Complaints about the packaging are surprising to me. I just lift the back from the corner or push the pill right through it. Can't think of how it can be improved. The medicine is great. I have been on it for at least three years and my bp has been consistently normal. Other meds have had side affects and my bp was up and down with them. Hope there are no long term side affects. Time will tell. ,5,5,5

My family doctor has been very impressed with my numbers since starting this med., I also take Atenolol(2x/day), and Lisinopril(2x/day). So far so good, and I have tried walking more often so with the combination of the meds and a healthy lifestyle, my numbers have come down.",4,4,4

I have tried taking it several times since them only to end up with a sinus headache, fever, chills and then I feel completely drained and sleepy.  Is anyone eles having any problems like these.",5,5,5
I have high blood pressure for several years. My pressure is under control well now.  I have suffered 2 miscarriages and just now reading the effects of the medicine. I now need another medicine to try so that I may try to  have a child before it is too late.  I have started to have  leg and hand cramps to the point of needing to take potassium daily.  My glucose level usually runs from 95-110 am to 135 highest after last meal.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone else.,4,3,5
I am wondering if Micardis makes a person cough.  I've had a nagging cough since being on it.,5,3,4
been taking for three years. if i dont take it blood presure goes up. hairloss very bad. hairloss causing much stress.  ,4,3,5
"I have taken other medications that were not effective in reducing my bp numbers. I'm particularly glad that the one pill does the work of two.

"caregiver for 76 yr old aunt.  You had better be really careful taking this med.  Aunt totally passed out, white, eyes rolled back, hospital dr said very low sodium due to many years on this drug.  Hospital dr. took her off it.  This was 2 years ago.  After few months regular dr. put her back on it for ankle swelling.  She has had dizziness, diarhea, confusion and kidney disease!  Last week back in hospital - very low sodium again!  This can cause death!  Hospital dr. took her off Micardis HCT again and told reg. dr. NOT to put her back on it!  Also many of you said to drink lots of water, but if you do you are FLUSHING the sodium, potassium etc out of your system and making the problem worse.  If you continue to take this drug drink sports drinks with electrolytes as well as water and have your sodium levels monitored.  In my opinion this is a bad drug!",2,1,2
"I have been taking Micardis, 40mg.  and a separate hydrochlorothiazide pill, 25mg. I was taking the HCT before the Micardis was substituted for other drugs that were causing problems. Took the combination for about a year, and suddenly my blood glucose shot up very high, after always having normal readings.  My hair began to thin extremely, and my vision became blurry.    I thought I had read on the Micardis package insert that diabetes was one of the possible side effects, but my dr. denies this, and I cannot find this information again.    However, the side effects of HCT are listed as dehydration, dry mouth, thirst, hair loss, blurred vision, which I had all of.  I stopped taking the HCT, and shortly after, the dry mouth and thirst disappeared completely.  The hair loss seemed to be lessening, and hair might be growing back in again.  In the meantime, dr. will not stop the Micardis because he swears it has nothing to do with the glucose levels.  So I am still taking it, but worrying every day that I swallow that pill.    I am writing on this board to caution you about the diuretic portion of the Micardis HCT.  These symptoms sneak up on us and as for me, it took me awhile to figure out what was causing them, if I have.  I prefer to take the diuretic separately from the bp drug, as it gives me more control over the dosages and necessity for them. I will go on another diuretic and see if I can avoid those problems.  If anyone has information about a Micardis package insert stating that diabetes is a possible side effect, please let me know.  The Micardis is very effective in lowering my bp, but since I stopped taking the HCT, the bp has been a few points higher, but still in a pretty good range.  I will start Lasik, which I hope will bring the bp back down.  It was running about 110/70 or thereabouts.",3,4,4
I have taken this for 10 years.it reduced my blood pressure great. but started having joint stiffness. calf muscles. feet. and lower back. felt tired all the time.

There have been no adverse side effects to report. There has been an increase in the amount of urine produced and frequency to eliminate.

"EXCELLENT RESULTS, BUT EXPENSIVE.",5,5,5
Taking a 3 in one once a day makes my pill popping regime far simpler.I also take minipress twice a day. It worked from day one and is still effective after 3 months. It is the first blood pressure medication that seems to work for me and so far there have been no apparent side effects.,5,4,4
"This medication is good in the sense that I take one pill instead of three, I have high blood pressure that is chronic, but since I have been using this medication there was little improvement, my BP is always high and couple with side effect of dry mouth, I have to take several sips of water in the night due to dry mouth and heart burn almost every night also i went to clinic the other day i was told my potassium was loss they had to quickly gave me juice. I am tired of taking three pills at the same time that is why I stick to this medication but I don't see any changes. Also I have to pay co-payment because it s brand name, but when I was taking amplodipine and other medication they were all $0 co-payments.",5,2,2
"I have been taking Valsartan for years. It was one of the two BP meds I was on. Things were good. Then it was recalled (Scary)!!! My Doctor replaced it with Olmesartan Medoxomil 20mg. I was experiencing neck pain periodically. At first, I blamed it on working on a computer all day at work. My heart rate was different. Then my shoulders started hurting as well and the pain would radiate down my arm to the point that I was not able to carry my pocket book or groceries in the house. I would need frequent breaks when completing household chores or stop if I was walking. I blamed it on being too tired. I scheduled weekly massages and would ask the masseuse to concentrate on my neck, shoulder and upper back. Some nights, I was not able to sleep comfortably unless I used heating pads. My family and I went on a fun trip but I could barely enjoy it. I was taking pain killers everyday to get me through. I also brought some heating pads with me to use at night while sleeping. One day, my husband made a comment that he thinks it was the new med because I was never that sick. I went online and was shocked from the reviews. A lot of people taking the same medication were having the same issues. I wanted to stop immediately but because of the risk, I decided to wait until I was back home. As soon as I returned home, I informed my physician and asked him to put me on a different one. Since then all the symptoms and pain associated have vanished. My advice is, if you are on olmesartan and experiencing some of the same symptoms please talk to your physician because it could be related to the medication. ",2,1,2
"Strike one: Was taking Valsartan and I did start seeing more hair in the shower drain however I continued the prescription. But it was later recalled because the ingredients included a suspected carcinogen Strike two: Placed on Olmesartan. Though it seemed effective in reducing blood pressure.  Within a a week or two of taking I suffered from severe lethargy, neck and shoulder pain which lead to difficulty swallowing. Will there be a strike three?  No, I would rather live life fangs out hair on fire for a year than be depressed, in pain and couch locked for twenty years.",1,1,4

"I have used the Benicar brand as well as the generic for 15 years. Due to insurance changes I had to purchase generic out of Canada, not real difference. It may have worked better than Benicar. Went on Benicar with manufacture supplied through Lake Pharmacy. They stopped that program. Back to generic for much less since the patient ran out. It has worked well for me in the part and I have tried other options. I have notice slight sun issues, not sure if it is medication. Started on this during some medical issues requiring other medications. ",5,5,5
Massive hair loss from this stupid drug! Was on Benicar with no side effects and doctor decided to give me the generic. Wow! This same thing happened when I took Atenolol and I had to fight to get another drug. Doctor kept saying it was probably hereditary and I argued until I got the Benicar. Then they went and changed it. Going back on Benicar now. ,3,1,3

This medicine along with other beta blockers (at separate times) caused me to have angina so bad, that I had to take nitroglycerin several times a day for about six months.... Also had a bad cough...no sex interest...  I was also so tired and no energy..... all while the Pindolol caused me to have insomnia, and I had bad dreams when I was able to sleep.  Doctors were rude and mean to me when I tried to tell them what I was going through.  It's been a rough year, but I finally got a doctor to listen and change the pill to a different med.  Within 3 days, I can tell a big difference, and am now getting excited about the fact, I may get my life back.",1,1,1

"I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at the age of 24 with no family history.  Pindolol was prescribed, and I have been very happy with the results.  When originally prescribed I had bouts of dizziness, but with my doctor's consultation, I cut the dosage down to once a day.  I've had no problems since.

BP still running in the 140 to 160 range so Bendroflumethiazide 2.5 added which was the drug from hell made me impotent, somewhat indifferent to life in general and I could not venture out without knowing where the nearest urinal was and it did nothng for my BP. Now on Lisinopril 40 mg and 20 mg Amlodopine no side effects and BP below 135. Thinking about just Lisinopril as it works for me but I have to have an annual check for kidney damage. OK so far",5,5,5

My BP was high, but not severe. My BP now is around the 120/80 range give or take 10 on either. I guess I'm one of the success stories. I felt like a new man once I was put on Lisinopril.",5,5,5

"60 yrs old F - Had borderline high BP and have been taking 5 mg of Lisinopril per day for past month. I feel much better & it has controlled my BP, but the cough/post nasal drip may be the deal breaker on this one. Too bad, because othewise it has worked great for me. I also wonder what it does to the lungs over time.",5,3,5
For over a year the drug worked very well. I had a SUDDEN  SEVERE allergic reaction. My tongue began swelling and within an hour I could not talk or swallow. I spent an afternoon in the ER getting IV prednisone and benadryl followed by prednisone and benadryl orally for a week.,5,1,5
"i take 50 mg of atenolol twice daily, 10 mg. of norvasc, and 40 mg. of prinivil and still have hogh bp",3,2,2
"I was taking the minimum dose of lisinopril and developed a dry, hacking cough will chills and muscle aches.  My doctor told me to go home and gargle salt water! I changed doctors and the first thing he said after asking why I was there and what I was taking, ""It's the Lisinopril.  Let me give you something else!"" My husband is a diabetic and has really bad high blood pressure. He's been on Lisinopril for nearly 3 years.  Last Sat. I woke up to find him feeling his face and looking at his tongue which was swollen to nearly 5 times the normal size.  He couldn't swallow and could barely talk. I took him to the ER immediately - the triage nurse asked if he took lisinopril - we said yes and she said, ""We see this a lot!  About 50% of the people who come in with this problem (angioedema) are on the lisinopril.  He also has trouble with swelling in his feet and hands; has balance problems and has fallen several times.  I want to watch him to see if being off the lisinopril helps with these other problems!!  They should take it off the market!!",3,1,3
"All doctors insist that I take meds to prevent kidney failure since I am a type I diabetic.  Lisinipril made me very tired all of the time and foggy headed.  I could not concentrate at work, and eventually ended up quitting my job because I thought I couldn't handle it any longer.  I also experienced tightness of my muscles and tendons in my legs while taking this.  Everything improved when I finally realized it was the medicine that caused this and stopped taking it.",4,1,1
"I work in a high stress professional field. I was put on 30 mg of lisinopril, and within 2 months had gained over 20 pounds with my regular 3 mile a day walk and work out. I felt as though I was working thru a thick fog and lost a lot of ability to concentrate. I dropped off the foul stuff, and feel like I am re-involved with life again. A good cigar with an after dinner drink is better to control things with than not being able to work or function properly. Horrible stuff.",4,1,3
"I had severe anxiety after taking this drug once.  When I slept I had nightmares and awake I had panic attacks about completely illogical things (what to wear, etc.)  The doctor and pharmacist said this was a rare reaction.  I'm someone who normally worries about stuff, but this medicine amplified a casual worry till it was fear beyond reason. Doctor took me off the medicine and gave me something else.  It did lower my pressure for 24 hours, though!",5,1,4
"nagging, choking, cough",1,1,4
"Worked pretty good for over a year, absolutely zero symptoms.  Recently though can't tolerate.  Developed very severe fatigue and brain fog - as if my battery (power source) was pulled and I just wound down.  Stopped drug and symptoms stopped.  Restarted and they reappeared after 3 weeks.  Wish I could keep taking it as  it's very low-cost but the side-effects I'm encountering have rendered it intolerable for me now.",5,3,3
"I was on a generic version for 2 years of misery. Tried other drugs (beta blocker) but had terrible side effects. Went to a combo of generic lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide + generic form of norvasc. The lsinopril was the most effective component but side effects built up over time (severe anxiety, palpitations and muscle cramps). Dr. said I could be reacting to the filler in the generic version or to the drug molecule itself. The molecule in the generic is slightly different from that in the name brand. Since it was so effective at lowering BP she suggested we try the name brand version. It's like night and day. 95% of the bad side effects went away within 1 week with equally effective BP control. The only disadvantage is the extra cost ($38 per mo vs. $6). ",5,4,5
 extreme sleepiness,5,3,4
Was on lisinopril for several years.Developed a hacking cough that was almost uncontrolable. Had a retinal detachment that was NOT caused by trauma/diabetes ect. Read up on possible causes of retinal detachment and severe caughing was one cause listed When I complained about my hacking caugh my doctor seemed to know Lisinopril was the cause. He changed my meds to eliminate Lisinopril and I do not cough nearly as much. I blame Lisinopril for my de-tachment. My operation to re-attach my retina is another issue...my doctor NEVER told me to stop taking Plavix before my eye operation and of courst my operation failed! I am blind in my right eye THANX LISINOPRIL AND PLAVIX,1,1,1
"I am also taking a beta-blocker and the combination is causing me to overheat and profusely perspire for no reason. It has helped bring down my BP, but the aches & pains, coughing and lethargy make me wonder if it's worthwhile to keep taking it.",5,2,3
"I am now on my second bottle of lisinopril, which entails about 3 months.  I noticed a few weeks ago that I started with an alergy, or I thought it was an alergy. I started coughing, a tickle, then sneezed, then watery eyes.I felt nauseated and had very thick clear saliva that felt like I was choking. I had no idea it was from the pills, but decided to look it up anyway and was shocked to find out that other people had experienced the same symptoms.  Since it was July, i really thought it was an allergy. I also have swelling of my ankle, although that is why my dr. put me on it because I was presenting with high B/P and swelling of the ankle.  I will stop taking it and ask my dr. for something else.  I am also having joint pain and will mention this also to the dr. ",4,1,2
"I have developed the cough, especially at night time. Have developed allergy symptoms (watery eyes, stuffiness, itchy throat) that i never had before.  Very tired and like another reviewer said, my sciatica also has been acting up worse than ever.  Cannot wait to get something else.",5,1,5
I have been taking 10Mg a day for 5 weeks. Developed dry coughing about 2 weeks into taking the pills. Will have to request getting off this drug.  Coughing is worst at night.,3,2,3
Has an adverse effect upon sex life,5,4,5
"i have hypertension,,,lisinopril, both with and without a diuretic are effective at the proper dosage,,at least 20mg/daily,,,sometimes, 10mg 2xs daily is better than 20mg once, but the effectiveness of 10mg at a time vs 20mg is not great,,,",5,4,4
"After a month on this prescription, I developed coughing when laying in bed.  Doctor switched me over to COZAAR and after using it, the coughing not only stopped, but my BP dropped considerably to 106/70 (and maintained that BP).",5,2,3
"Mom's med Prinivil; ACE-Inhibitor. Side effect of all meds in group can cause extreme/severe lip, mouth, neck, throat swelling that cuts off air supply. Can lead to death; my mom almost DID die from this med.  If you take and experience any swelling, discontinue and see your dr!!!",4,1,3
Had ankle swelling and a very bad cough after taking for a couple of weeks.  Took for 6 weeks and cough kept getting worse.,5,1,4
"Dr.added this to my other bp meds.20mg once a day,first day it lowered my bp to 71/50. I could not keep my eyes open, heart was pounding.dr. said it takes 1 week to fill full effects. i quit after first day.",1,1,1
Does a very good job of lowering blood pressure.,5,5,5
Quickly corrected a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Have been taking for 9 months at 10mg daily dose.  No side effects. I am very happy with results. My last BP was 114/70.,5,5,5
"I have been on this medication for less than two weeks and was experiencing rapid heart beat, extreme fatigue, joint pain and other overall scary side effects.  I have discontinued, no matter how my much doctor ""promotes"" it.  Took me off something that was working for me 100% and put me on this roller coaster ~ no thanks!",3,1,1
"huge tongue, had trach",5,3,5
"I am a health care professional. I have been on Lisinorpil for about 3 weeks. I have a dry cough, sore throat,Chills, dizziness, stomach pain, Fever, Muscle cramps, heavy sweating  and Sexual dysfunction. And it has done nothing for my blood pressure.   I wouldnt touch this stuff with a ten foot pole again!",3,1,2
"At age 63 just found out my blood pressure was high, started this drug with 20mg daily, got terrible headaches, sleepy, and dizzy. Cut back to 10mg daily only helps lower pressure at a minimum. Still dealing with ocassional dizzy spells and fatigue.",5,2,2
"I took 20mg for 8 days and when I got up from a sofa and started to walk I passed out and hit my head on a stair picket and cut my forehead severely. Was rushed to the hospital where i received 8 stitches and had to spend night in hospital for observation.  Was x-rayed, cat-scanned, etc.  After being examined by three MDs was told that the problem was the dosage of Lisinopril (20mg)as it had lowered my blood pressure to low to fast. When I passed out the second time my blood pressure was 6o over 40.  Now I have a permanent scar on my forehead and a $6,000 hospital bill.  I have been in perfect health for 65 years (I jog, do yoga and tai chi)...but when I turned 65 I went to get my ""free"" welcome to medicare checkup where the Dr. found that I had ""border line"" high blood pressure and he prescribed the 20mg of Lisinopril. If I had fell in a different direction, I wouldn't be writing this review, I would be in a cemetery.  When I visited the MD who prescribed the medication he showed almost no conern (he has three offices and sees one patient every 15 minutes); hence, how can he keep track of each patient.  Yes we have a health care crisis but, at times, the Drug Companies and MDs can make matters worse.  I stopped taking the medication.  The bottom line is that the medication can lower blood pressure...but an unintended consequence may kill you.  You are better off trying to lower your blood pressure by changing your lifestyle as opposed to taking this medication.  The MD never warned me that I may get dizzy and pass out...I guess I am lucky that I am still alive as it could have been worse.  Whatever happened to the motto ""first do no harm""",5,1,5
"I have found the 'prinivil' by name has been great for controlling the BP,but, the 'generic' gave me many stomach problems, can't explain that, wish the generic(s) worked as they are much less expensive.

" About three years ago i was on three high blood pressure medications (lisinopril, atenolol and hydrocholorthiaziade).  After starting a rigorous exercise program and adding more fruit and vegetables to my diet, my blood pressure dropped so low that the doctor stopped all blood pressure medicine. I am now only taking 20 mgs of lisinopril a day which also keeps my kidneys clear of protien, and i feel great!!",5,5,5

"Side effects were terrible.  Drug was discontinued due to incapacitating abdominal pain and tenderness, insomnia, fatigue & muscle aches.  BP came down nicely, but what good is this if you're miserable?  ",5,1,1
"Have been on this med for 6 months now and am tired of the dry cough, especially when I lay down (i.e. at night).  I've noticed my sciatica has worsened but am not sure it's related to this medication.  My Dr. decided to switch me to Cozaar but I didn't go that direction since it is extremely expensive and is known to cause the dry cough, too.  All in all, the lisinopril that I'm taking is working OK...and is kinder to my diabetic kidneys than the previous med, Tenormin, that I took for many years.",5,3,4
"Over a period of 6 months I slowly developed severe joint pain, cramping and muscle pain to the extent that I could not walk more than 1/4 mile. All symptoms dissappeared 3 days after stoppage. ",5,1,5

My blood pressure did not come down and I suffered from nausea all day every day that I took it.,3,1,1

I have been getting the generic from Canada to reduce my costs, but it is still is very expensive.  About a month ago, I ran out and was without it for about 3 weeks.  Lo and behold, the almost crippling pain in my toes and joints and back decreased dramatically and I suddenly had energy!  I have spinal stenosis and diabetic neuropathy, so I had never attributed any of my severe nerve and joint pain to Tekturna, but now I think it must have been the cause of a lot of my pain.  I'm going to ask my doc to try a different medication.",3,1,3

"The first time pill I took, within 1 hour I was feeling weak.  The doctor office said to keep taking it so my body would get use to it si I stuck with the program even though I would feel weak like I was going into shock.  I made it two weeks and I threw the stuff out and called my doctor and said I quit.  I only have one kidney.  I was urinating less and felt weak on Tekturna.  After a couple days of being off of it I started feeling better.  My creatinine(sp) readings are normally around 1.5 to 1.6.  I'm a big guy, bones and muscle so...I have a little bit of kidney damage before Tekturna ad the weakness and less urine made me panic so I tossed it out.  I only have this one kidney to live on.

"Found myself with a sore throat, tired more so than usual, cough that is dry and never goes away, blurred vision and fair amount of watering eyes. This medication has done great bringing my pressures down from 162/110 down to 106/78. I am sure my body likes these numbers but I cannot tolerate feeling so crappy so much of the time. I already have fibromyalgia and spinal pain, so the additioal painfullness from Tekturna is not a welcome feeling.",5,1,1
"Tekturna has been a bad experience for me. Because ARBs and ACE inhibitors were not working so well anymore, I was switched to Tekturna. The first day I took 150 mg of Tekturna with a small rise in BP. The second morning, I took 300 mg of Tekturna and quickly developed a piercing headache (and I rarely get headaches for any reason) and felt very ""unwell"", and by the afternoon, my blood pressure had risen from 140/90 to an ALL TIME RECORD HIGH for me - 170/100! I woke up the third day with a very sore throat (which eased after aspirin). My waking BP on the third day was 138/89 (after taking 2.5 mg xanax to lower my dangerous BP the night before), but after 150 mg of Tekturna, my BP soared to 159/92 and is still rising.",5,1,1

Only side effects experienced have been an unproductive cough and occ pain in kidney area, as well as decreased libido. It is expensive--$3+/day, as compared to the generics, which run $10/for 3 mo.

My Dr. cut the dose in half, which alleviated the fugue state but left me with unusual daily fatigue, and then came the diarrhea or the constant urgue to go to the bathroom.

"I have had borderline hypertensive readings for over five years: up to 140/90, down to 94/72. But over the past year, the readings have been at the high end. So my GP prescribed 150mg Tekturna per day for six weeks. My blood pressure went down to 127/80, but those were six miserable weeks.  It was as if I never quite woke up. I was sleepy and in a dream state all 'waking' hours, every day, except twice when I deliberately did not dose in order to get some urgent work done. My supervisor and I had words regarding my suddenly lackluster performance at work, and this was after I took up a Starbucks habit just to get through the day.   I was so sluggish that my blood sugar readings rose nearly 100 points, on average, so that I had to increase my insulin dosage. My blood glucose levels are sensitive the the amount of activity in which I engage, and I am usual moving constantly. I didn't move unless I absolutely had to while taking Tekturna. It was a major effort just to type an email.  Then there was the hyperhydrosis. I have never sweated so profusely in my life. Co-workers were alarmed when the least bit of movement caused me to sweat profusely. I sometimes soaked through an entire set of clothing within fifteen minutes just by walking (slowly) for three minutes.  I'm glad some people find benefits with this treatment. However, I am loving life now that I've stopped the treatment and moved on to a diuretic.",4,2,4

"With Tekturna I feel nauseated, and have serious diarrhea.",1,1,3
"I was on Benicar, Diovan, Altace and they all worked for about 3 months then my pressure would go up and I would have to increase my dosage until It juststopped working. After taking Tekturna 300 my pressure went from an average170/102 down to 122/72 and remained there. I also had 0 side effects. Best medicine I ever had for HBP.",5,5,5
i like it but the results are not there,2,3,3
"Started on 150mg and was increased to 300mg... been on it for almost a year... Yes, it did bring my blood pressure down but did not realize the problem I was having was from the meds. till I started reading reviews here.. was embarrassed about having fecal leakage thought something might be wrong with me.. have stopped taking the tekturn and am now back to normal.. plus, pain in left arm & shoulder had been increasing ..felt like it was in the muscle & bone .. that has also has eased up but am hoping for it to completely go away in time.  No more tekturna for me....",3,2,3

I'm tried, dizzy, itching, feel sick to my stomach, heaviness in chest, and a lot of pain in my feet. I agree with the person who said bp is a very scary thing when nothing seems to work. I also take 2Lisinopril/HCTZ 20-12.5,Isosorb Mono 30mg. ER, and Atenolol 25mg. 1/2 tablet a day. Also, I have been just the opposite of most patients, instead of putting on weight, for now I'm losing. (Good side effect for me)To go along with everything else I also have irregular heartbeat. Anyone else?",5,1,2
"On Tekturna - side effects after taking for 2 months gained 12 lbs, watery eyes, lower back pain, bloating, severe headaches and swollen gums. Can't sleep more than 3-4 hours at night on this med. Stopped taking two days ago to see if this clears side effects up. Looking for natural bp relief!",5,2,3
"Taking 300 mg of Tekturna caused too much fatigue, dry mouth, itching, weight gain,back and joint pain, watery eyes and acid reflux so bad I went to ENT to correct it.  Had none of these symptoms prior to BP meds. Now taking 150 and am considering discontinue med entirely.  Lowered my BP to 117/but side effects especially weight gain is not worth it.  WIll try exercise, eating right and taking no meds for awhile and see how that works.  I also take Simavastin which I may continue if no side effects.",1,1,3
"My BP has come down & I am satisfied with that.  However, I have some kind of a skin condition on my hands...dry, cracking, bleeding, hurt, etc which I have not had before. It started shortly after I started taking Tekturna & I don't knonw if it is related or not. Anybody have a similar experience?",5,4,4

I am taking 150mg of Tekturna for about a month. My blood pressure has come down a bit but I have a very bad cough. I cough day & night.also causes watery eye and runny nose. Going to dr to get a different medication asap.,4,2,3
Tekturna has brought my blood pressure closer to controlling it better than any other medication I have ever taken.,5,5,5

"I started on 150 mg Tekturna  with good results.  However, my BP increased to around 140/100 after 7 months.  The medication was supplemented with 25 mg HCT and I started feeling dizzy with no improvement in lowering my BP.  Recently, 300 mg Tekturna was prescribed and I am now experiencing lower back pains and tenderness in those same areas.  I stopped taking the  pills for now until I see my doctor soon.  ",4,2,3
"No side effects for me, BP is well mamaged now after failing 2 other medications previously. My biggest concern for this medication is the cost of one month supply of 300 mg. tablet's. I learned it would cost me $107.00 a month. I am on samples now, but my doctor will have to Rx something more cost effictive for me. I find the med to be more than a scam on the price, shame on you Novartis. This is only medication, not a medical procedure. There are more meds out there than your's that I can afford. Maybe you could cut down on your advertisement and stop taking all those costly meals and gifts to medical professionals to ""sell"" your products!! Yes I am a nurse and I know much about you Pharmaceutical companies, been there, done that!!  Yes, SHAME on you!!",5,5,5

"I immediately developed a toxic reaction to the drug.  I only took 9 doses.  I had a fever(104.6)first and took aspirin for that which exacerbated the toxic reaction and that led to renal and liver failure.  I was hospitalized for 5 days.  BUN, creatnine, and bilirubin finally started to come down and I was able to avoid dialysis.  Effects have lasted for months.",4,1,1
I still have high blood pressure 160/90,2,1,2

"My Family Practitioner prescribed 1/2 of a 150mg Tekturna once daily, as an adjunct to other BP meds that I was already taking (Atenolol, Verapamil,Terazosin, & Indapamide), in an attempt to control an elevated systolic BP.   The first night that I took it my nose started running and my eyes watered all night. The watering eyes had stopped by mid morning the next day, but my nose was still running. I called my MD, and he was a little surprised that I had suffered the side effects with such a low dose. He said, however, to stop the Tekturna. The runny nose was better by evening but took another day to essentially resolve itself.",1,1,2
"I've been using this drug for about a year now but I recently started getting an itchy rash on my shins & inside my arms.  I also take Diavan HCt 320/25, Folic Acid 2mg,Plavix 75mg, Lipitol 20 mg, Coumadin 5 mg, Norvase 5 mg.  Could this be interacting with any of these to cause the rash?  I have an appointment with a dermatoligist next month per my primary physician because he doesn't know what's causing it. ",4,4,4
reading the other reviews I thought it was just me with the problems concerning my vision and feeling tired all the time. I have been on this medicine for 1 month and I am wondering if it is also causing me the lost of focus and attention. they really need to have an alternative or better generic drug. pricing to high,4,3,3

"I have been on this medication for a few months, My docotor included Amlodipine 5mg, now I am up to 10 with 300 mg Tekturna..My legs are swelling now with itching and extreme exhaustion. This is the fourth drug combo I have been on. Other drugs worked for a while, then.. side effects..I am changing my lifestyle; exercise,I have eliminated most meats, eating more fruits and veggies.. It has to be a better way to control this.. Why is there such an increase in this medical problem? Everyone cannot have high blood pressure without reason?, even if it is hereditary. what is happening?.  ",4,2,2
"Difficult to control HBP runs in family. Started Tekturna 300 mg when side effects from both CCB and ACE were not tolerable. Drug worked okay (BP 130/85) for first year then lost effectiveness. Along with decreased effectiveness came worsening side effects most notably pre-ventricle contractions (about every third heartbeat) and fatigue. BP readings as high as 151/121 recorded on Tekturna. Three weeks after switching medications, my BP is 110/80, fatigue is gone and heart rhythm greatly improved. This was not the drug for me.  ",4,1,1

"Have taken many prescriptions for BP with poor results but finally hit on a combo that seems to work. Have taken Tekturna 150 along with Bystolic 10 and HCl 25 for about 4 mos.  this is the first combination that has successfully reduced my BP to below 140/ 90, so I feel I am stuck with it.  However, was on Bystolic alone at first, so, other than fatigue, all symptoms seem to be from Tekturna, ie: dry caugh, occasional acid reflux, continuous runny nose.  Noticing some hair loss.  Has anyone experienced sore teeth and sores inside the mouth from biting the inside of your cheek while sleeping?  ",5,3,4
"A new product from Germany I am taking every morning: Tekturna/(aliskiren)150mg, with 8 other prescriptions. Start with it 4 months ago with other one for cholesterol: Crestor 10mg.

"I have experienced hair loss, intense muscle fatigue, and brain fog.  At times the nerve endings in my body feel very tender, almost like a burning sensation.  This drug does stay in my system longer than 24 hours, so I am trying to reduce my dosing to every other day. I began at 150 mgs. and am now taking 300 mgs every other day. I have tried every other family of blood pressure medicines, so I guess I could say this is the drug of last resort for me. ",4,2,3

Been on drug 300-25mg over one year. Worked wonders on my BP. But I was found to have numerous kidney stones in both kidneys. Had to have two surgical sonic blastings to break up the bigger stones. Just be sure to see a Renal doc to check your kidney functions while using this med.,5,3,4

Bad medicine!!! ",1,1,5
The diarrhea is not good for a working person; it is unmanageable when it starts.,5,2,5
"I am glad it helped you.  How long have you been taking tekturna?  It was working for me for about two years before I started getting real sick and found out it was tekturna hct causing me all these health problems like crohns disease, low sugar, gallbladder removal, fibroidbialgia,I spelted this wrong but also other severe problems.  Don't take it too long or you will be sorry.",3,1,1
"I had uncontrollable high blood pressure, and had tried many combinations of BP meds to try to control.  When Tekturna came on the market, my internist suggested I try it.

Tekturna gave me back my life.",5,5,5
"Blood pressure lowered from 190/98 to 117/73 within three days of starting this drug.  Was totally amazed and quite pleased!  Then, weight gain of 5-pounds within seven days of starting this medication.  (Please note, I actively watch and keep my caloric intake to less than 1000 calories per day and have an exercise regimen that has maintained my ideal weight for the past year.) Legs, arms and face showed signs of swelling on day five.  Lips began swelling on day ten.  Lightheadness and a feeling of disassociation with sporadic blurred vision occured almost daily.  Generally a poor physical feeling (heaviness and bloating) that I am not accustomed to. Have stopped this drug in the last three days and the feeling of bloating and heaviness are diminishing.  A sense of well-being has returned and my scale is showing a reduction in ounces daily.  Was truly amazed and pleased with how quickly my BP lowered...so very sad to have experienced these side effects.  Just not the drug for me.  Am checking my BP daily until I can see my doc again...so far, so good: 148/81 is the highest it has been in the last three days and that's continuing with the other two meds I have been on for years (clonidine & verapamil).",5,1,5

My BP seems to be higher Than usual,5,1,1
"Seems to have lowered BP, but losing a few pounds would probably also work.  Main difficulty is that for about 8 hours after I take this drug, if I crouch down and then stand up, I am so dizzy, I can barely keep my balance.  this lasts 30-60 seconds and then goes away.  It is annoying, but manageable.  That is the only time I experience a difficulty.

"Following a 14 hr. Spinal Fusion surgery with considerable blood loss, I began having a rapid heart beat, but ONLY when trying to stand up from my hospital bed. It had been an issue in the past as well, as I have undergone MANY (20+) spinal surgeries,and I felt dizzy & light-headed following those procedures also.I had NOT been treated with medication, in a few cases I simply required a transfusion to restore my lowered blood level and some additional rest. This time, the hospital's cardiac Dr on call put me on Toprol 25, which helped, but in general, my symptoms went away after about 3-4 days.Afterwards, at my follow-up with my Primary Dr., I was found to have hypothyroidism, and he started me on Levothyroxine, and continued the Toprol as he felt the thyroid replacement could cause rapid heart beat in the beginning. About 8 months later I began to have severely increased fluid retention in my legs despite being on a long term diuretic. They felt puffy and weak, my walking was extremely limited with barely enough energy to walk down my driveway. I have NEVER had to watch my weight,and I very rarely gain due to over eating. Suddenly I began to pack on pounds despite no change in my diet, though it seemed the additional weight was restricted to my legs and feet, while the rest of me remained the same. (I am on the smaller side, 5'1"", and 100 lbs.) Reducing my intake was of no help at all, and I was tired, lacked stamina, and had little interest in my usual hobbies. I slowly began to take fewer and fewer Toprol tabs and immediately saw a reduction in the leg puffiness, and feeling of excess fluid in my legs and feet. My stamina is slowly returning to normal, and I am hopeful I will be back to normal soon in the near future.Sometimes all that's required is rest and letting nature take it's course to heal to return to my old self. Medications are not always required no matter what the issue is.Many times, less is best!!",3,2,3
After a few months I noticed I was having edema in my feet. It got worse and worse. Difficult to walk. Also had shortness of breath after very slight exertion.

The second day I felt even worse and by the third day after taking 4 doses I was so miserable I could not eat or sleep. It was like I had gorged myself and could not burp or belch and just kept getting worse. I called my doctor and he pulled me off of it and is going to put me on something else. Within 48 hours the bloating went away completely.",1,1,1

My doctor says it's all in my head.  I feel he is too quick to give meds and not finding the reason for the HP.  ",1,1,3
"My mother has to take 50 mg 4 times a day to get the blood pressure coverage. No matter what the dosing was, it doesn't last all day. She is presently taking the generic.",2,1,3
COUGHING AFTER TAKING DRUG,4,4,4
Works well for BP; in conjunction with other heart meds increased ED.,5,3,4
"46 yr old male. Highly stressful job as a  Personal Injury Trial Attorney. Began developing severe migraines (diagnosed w/out auras) about one year ago. My Neurologist put me on Amerge for acute migraines which works fantastic (as opposed to Maxalt which caused me to be very tired and helped for only 2 hours resulting in my migraine coming back stronger). Amerge is great. I started Torpol 50 mg extended release as i developed some moderately high blood pressure. Been on it for one month and have NO migraines. Yes, it does strangely enough cause strange dreams and after I take it, I am knocked out 60 minutes later. However, the benefits outweigh the minimal side effects. Very tolerable thus far and I am extremely pleased. Would definately try it. Dont listen to everything you read. It worked for me and you too, should give it a shot! ",5,4,4
I have taken this for years and it worked very well in controlling adrenaline rushes and atrial fib. However it slowed pulse rate to high 30's to mid 40's and doctor said it wasn't good and he wont prescribe it anymore. I will now be subject to the high anxiety which was the main reason he put me on it in the first place. Need to find something else I can take with Lisinipril.,4,4,5
"After taking Toprol XL for three years the pill is now a different shape. Each day I took the Toprol XL for six days the chest pain increased with strange dreams at night, joint pain, shortness of breath, exhaustion, general feeling of something is wrong. I stopped taking the Toprol XL and I feel great, except for high blood pressure with headache. If this continues I will go to my doctor. The manufacturer changed the formula and the medicine is making me deathly sick. What is an option for me when Toprol XL was the only option I could take????? I will report this to the FDA consumer line in case others are suffering side-effects similar to me.  ",4,1,2
"Lowered my pulse to 31, Diastolic to 64... felt cold, weak, tired, dizzy... bad stuff.",4,1,1
"I have gained 30lbs since beginning this med bp is on rise again, feet are swelling and joint pain, but depression is the worst. I am due doctor visit, I will be asking for new med",5,1,2
this medication does exactly what it's supposed to do.,5,5,5
"I have been on this almost a week. I used to be easily winded and always tired. I am only thirty years old at the moment I am writing this. Today I woke up with ease for once, didn't feel exhausted all day, and could run around at my job without feeling winded. This is the best I have felt in a long time. I am taking a low dose too because I have naturally low blood pressure 110/60 so there was not room to mess with it and I am not have problems managing as long as I keep a steady salt intake.",5,5,4
This is the only medication I can handle for my high blood pressure. All the other drugs my doctors tried for me caused way too many awful side effects. I can't take the generic as it causes me to have chest congestion.,4,4,4
"I have only been taking this drug for about a week,but everything is going well.",5,4,4
"I have been taking this for tachycardia and PVC's and resulting anxiety. 25mg. No side effects, it just works. I feel very calm and relaxed, yet energetic and ready for whatever life throws at me. I'm back to my old self. There is one pleasant side effect. I know I am in the minority here, but this stuff has a viagra-like effect on me. Maybe its just because I'm feeling so good. Whatever the reason, I'll accept this 'side effect' and make the best of it.",5,5,5
"This med has been very effective keeping my BP in check, however, more recently I have also been taking amiodarone for an afib condition.  I remained on the same dose of Toprol XL, 100mg, and now I am concerned that I have occasional low BP conditions that are causing dizziness.  I will be discussing a lower dose with my doctor at the next visit.",5,4,5
"Almost as soon as I started taking this medicine, I experienced horrible joint pain. My doctor said I must have picked up a bug but I knew it was the medicine. I felt fine until I took the first dose. I also had extreme dizziness to the point I couldn't get out of bed and missed 2 days of work. My doctor advised me to stop taking it and then 4 days later, start cutting the pills in half and taking half the dose. I was only taking 25 mg. It took 4 days before I started to feel better and I told my doctor that I refused to take it anymore. Thank goodness I only took a low dose for a short period of time. After reading some of the other reviews, there is definitely a connection to joint pain. I was taking it for high blood pressure and there are so many other options out there. Beware this drug!",1,1,1
"I take 200 mg of Metoprolol. I have a hyperthyroid and Atrial Fibrillation with RVR along with an enlarged heart. Plus on top of that I take 240 mg of Diltiazem. I do not believe that Metoprolol works that well.   My side effects are the same for the Metoprolol as well as my conditions. I feel like at my age Doctors will not be aggressive in treating my heart condition. One specialist saying it is another specialist problem. I am so young and I feel there is an issue when my father(who is in his 70's with quadruple bypass and I are on the same dosage of heart meds. I cannot get help beyond taking pills but people in their ""golden years"" can have it taken care of immediately. ",5,1,2
"I am taking this for prevention of recurrent atrial flutter. Until my doctor upped the dosage to 37.5 mg a day I still had symptoms, now I am symptom free. I was bothered by dizziness when I took it, but taking the meds just before bed now has me side effect free. It has turned out to be an inexpensive and effective maintenance med for me.",5,5,5
Every time I take this medicine it raises my blood pressure. ,4,1,1
"My insurance company switched me to this medication.  Upon taking it and within 2 weeks of start my blood pressure elevated drastically and my pulse shot up.  I started having headaches, shortness of breath and occasional angina, depression and generally felt awful! I will never take  ",4,1,1
Taking 100mg. Good except pulse low now 31 beats pm. ,5,3,4
"Heart skipping beats occasionally. No chest pain, no other physical reactions. Rx was for Toprol, but pharmacy dispensed generic Metoprolol.  Heartbeat has improved. No negative side effects. Doctor ordered an echocardiogram just in case.",5,4,4
no side effects ,4,4,4
Insomnia,5,2,3
Sorry to hear so many are having problems but to me this drug is great. I started having severe panic attacks about 25 years ago when my son was born and I decided to stop drinking and doing drugs cold turkey. After stopping the things that were keeping me sedated the panic attacks came on full force.  My Dr back then prescribed me Xanax and it helped some but after about a year it stopped because my body had become used to it so instead of raising the dosage I again just stopped taking it. I decided to battle these panic attacks on my own with no drugs.  About a year ago I went for a check up (first one in 20 years)and they got a BP reading of 191 / 99 not once but 4 times. I went to my Dr and he gave me Toprol 25MG and  Ativan 1MG. He told me to take 1/2 of a Toprol in the morning and take the Ativan 3 times a day.  I can say I have had no side effects at all and after 3 months he dropped the Ativan to .5MG twice a day and the Toprol to 1/2 a pill every other day. My BP for the last 8 months has been 130/84 at its highest and 118/75 at its lowest with a resting heart rate between 59 and 65. I have not had any panic attacks for the last year and actually feel great.  I do smoke and drink about a gallon or more of Tea daily but even with the caffeine and nicotine in my system those pills keep my BP down. I also admit I am a junk food lover and have been known to eat pizza. burgers and hot dogs 7 days a week but no weight gain so its all good.  I hope you people with side effects find a cure because getting everything under control and back to normal feels great and Toprol + Ativan do the trick for me. I admit my dosage is very small so that may be why I have no side effects. ,4,5,4
"Started generic form of Toprol XL, Metoprolol Succ Er, 50 mg a day.  No change in BP readings.  Doctor increased dose to 100 mg a day.  Side affects are horrible, tired all day, sleepless nights. Throat closing up, coughing to breath.  Thinking foggy and dizzy, dropping things, forgetting things.  Feel like I have the flu.  Called Doctor today because of side affects and no change in BP readings.  He told me to stop taking immediately.  Will see him Monday to get new medication.  I see were a lot of people are saying the generic is bad but the name brand is okay.  I really do not want to take a chance on the name brand.  This experience has me questioning this medication.  I have been taking the name brand Norvasc with no side affects.  Maybe increasing the dosage of Norvasc can lower my BP readings.",4,1,2
"back in 2005,prescribed this for high b.p.- in a short time( 3 weeks) i was into heart failure,failing heart pumping, fluid in lungs,,mitral valve issue,finally after heart cath put on lasix and off the ToprolXL-took months but gradually improved greatly-almost 9 yrs and was doing well-  about 6 weeks ago, took 2 Aleve( new to me)next day, back into heart failure again- fluid in lungs, legs swelled, pain in chest, not coming out of it-now on lasix again, seeing a cardio at Hopkins- anyone else had this reaction from meds prescribed like beta blockers or over the counter? diagnosed w/ congestive heart failure, told i now need surgery- all this now from Aleve/naprozen. anyone else have this happen? allergic reaction?",1,1,1
it's really hard to measure it because i am taking it with so many other drugs,3,2,3
"I have slowly developed moderately high blood pressure but the most irritating thing I had was a 'flutter' in my heart beat.  I could feel it but the doc said it wasn't anything serious, just an extra half beat.  He put me on minimum dose of Toprol (25mg) and my flutter is gone, BP is perfect.  Can't detect any side effects.  Been on it for about 3 yrs.  Works great for my purposes.",5,5,5
"I developed high bp after developing trigeminal neuralgia 13 yrs. ago.  I am furious at docs now, because I suffer from depression, that is the first side effect of this drug!  That, and i was a gym rat before I got sick. Have tried cardio for the past 5 months and cannot get my heart rate up.... so finally checked more into this drug.  No wonder! Am going to doc tomorrow for new rx on something, but honestly, shouldn't someone know about this drug, given my propensity to depression and fatigue due to pain??",4,1,2
I HAVE USED THIS FOR 8 YEARS WITH FEW SIDE AFFECTS BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN CAUSING SOME ED! I AM 65!,4,3,4
Originally I was on 12.5mg Carvedilol 2X daily. BP then averaged 115/75.  BP average with Metoprolol XL (50mg 2X daily) has been 122/83. I'll monitor BP for the next couple months and then decide if it works for me.,3,2,2
"I have been on Toprol XL for 10 years now. Since the beginning had weight gain, hair loss, aches/joint pain, chest pains, swelling of ankles/feet, low sex drive and ED as well as saying ""that I had to think of having to breathe"" no one would believe me of any of these side effects. Now the DR. claims I have COPD (and no COPD meds work to help my breathing - something's wrong with that, could it be the Toprol)? tingling in toes most of the time, now irregular heartbeat and still have low sex drive, ED, swelling and tired all the time!!! Hummm Just switched to Metoprolol for cost purposes this week, first thing I noticed heavy chest was hoping for better breathing!!!  We'll see if anything changes?",4,2,3
"Works well for controlling episodes of rapid heartbeat, but has done nothing for migraines. I'm always tired from it, and cognitive function is impaired. ",3,1,1
"I wish my doctors would have never put me on this med, sex life is gone and they do not care. I hate this drug I hate it.",1,1,1

"After an episode of atrial fibrillation my Dr. changed my medication from Tenormin, which I had been taking for 35 years to Toprol.  I have been taking Toprol for 3 years now and have had only one side effect - fullness around my middle. Heart rate is 42-55 but do not feel fatigued.",4,4,4
lower stomach pains,4,3,4
"I have been on this drug for 15 years. I was on Toprol XL first, and then went on the generic metoprolol 50mg. I am really surprised to hear about the ""weight gain"" complaints, because my weight has stayed the same, the whole time. Another complaint was ""sluggishness"" I am tired for about 2 hours after taking this drug, and then it passes, and I am 100% ok.  I also take Yoga classes 3 times a week, and do some treadmill. I am on this medication because of Mitral valve problems, and I have been very satisfied with the drug.",4,4,5
"This med has brought my BP down but I have been to the doc several times for a severe itch, all over my body. I cant sleep for it. Will most likely discontinue use. ",5,2,3
Living normally.,4,4,4
"Use this drug to control SVT. I'm younger and smaller than most patients, but am on a very high dose (125mg daily). Although it does work well controlling my rhythms, it makes me SO tired that I can barely make it through work and school. Unfortunately I have been on most other meds that can control rhythm problems and this is the only one that works. Side effects of severe tiredness and mental fog are horrible. I've been taking it since I was 16 and am now 23.",3,2,4
"This medication should be taken off the market. At least the generic version. From day one on 25 mg I experienced dizziness and foggy head. I stuck with it thinking effects would disappear. As weeks passed I was constantly itchy, fatigued and I would wake up with such awfull joint pain and heavy legs. I would have to take Motrin to survive the day. I walked around like a zombie all day and could not concentrate at work. I was so tired could barely exercise. I was gaining weight rapidly epecially in the middle and my legs and feet swollen always. Then I started noticing the lack of sexual desire and I was totally unable to reach orgasm. At this point I decided I would taper myself off it slowly an monitor my bp. I have been exercising and eating well, taking natural supplements for bp. My doctor would not support my decision, which further increased my lack of confidence in out medical system. After about 2 months off this poison I'm finally feeling like myself again. On about day 3 I was going to the bathroom frequently and releasing a lot of fluid retention. Please ask your doctor for an alternative. This is pure poison and will severely decrease your quality of life. At 48 I was feelin more like 85.",1,1,1

I have had chronic back pain my entire life.  Starting in 2008 I have had 4 spinal fusion surgeries and one neurostimulator implant plus a heart attack.  It has been three years since my heart attack and for the first 34 months after the heart attack I would end up going to the hospital at least once a month because I felt like I was having a heart attack.  And two months ago my cardiologist started me on 1/2 of a 25 mg tablet per day and all my chest pain and fake heart attacks stopped.  It is like it was before my heart attack.  This is a great medicine.  I tried to take nitrates before but I had very severe headaches so I couldn't take them.  This has no side effects and it works great.,1,5,5
I take 100mg each day & it does work very well. If I miss a dose I will start to get a headache. It has helped me very much. No side effects.,5,5,5
"I had a minithoracotomy on 5/8/2012 (Cnaton, Ohio at the Aultman Hospital) for an enlarged heart.  Was on 200mg of Metoprolol Succinate per day. After surgery 25mg.

"While effective controlling my ventricular tachycardia along with my implanted defibralator the 10 lb weight gain in one year, fatigue, depression, personality changes and extremely cold ands and feet along with my hair falling out is NOT worth it.  Unfortunately my condition is not due to cardiac disease per se, but rather a ""spot"" which developed on the top outside of my heart and is not reachable to ablate.  It is casing electrical malfunction that is potentially fatal, meds to control this other than beta blkrs have worse, some fatal, side effects.  I am very upset..  Hate this drug.

"I take this medication at bedtime, I think to control my blood pressure overnight. I always check my blood pressure the first thing in the morning and the diastolic pressure is usually above 90 psi.

I've also had issues with dry throat and hoarseness in my voice and for that one they do agree and have changed me to different meds until found one that causes least hoarseness.

This is a dangerous drug and that side effect, hallucinations, while well known is not listed on the materials you receive - only after researching did I find that.  It dramatically reduced her quality of life.",4,1,1

My experience with this medication has been more negative then good. I feel worse if I take the medication then if I don't. The long term effects of the medication are far worse then the ill. My latest negitive side effect is blured vision in my left eye. I think the meds are going to kill me before my illness.,4,2,2

Had a follow up with another echogram and my heart is now almost normal with no skipped beats but still a slight erratic beat. Heartr is beating stronger with heart rate in the upper 60's and low 70's. I feel much better with no side effects.

My dose is very low (12.5 mg daily), and I insist on the name brand only -- no generics for this one -- because I have heard that there is a lot of variance between generics for this drug.  (Insurance company refuses to pay for it, but worth it to me.)  I have been very happy with it overall, it works well to minimize the severity of the arrythmias.  I do experience mild chest pain from time to time, though, that I think are from the med.  But the good definitely outweighs the bad.",5,5,5

No memory of two days prior to family member finding me in my home in altered mental state of severe confusion disorientation.  Did not recognize family members, unaware of my surroundings, etc., etc.  Rushed by ambulance to ER.  After recovering and then speaking with health care professionals I have learned that this ia rare, but very real, side effect of this drug.  Doctors should report this to their patients when prescribing this med.  I had no idea this was a possible side effect.  If I had known, my family and I would have been diligent and this horrifying episode could have been avoided.",1,1,1

"I was prescribed this med because I have angina; I had a stent placed in 2.5 months ago.  My bp has always been normal, so I think my cardiologist prescribed it for chest pain.  Only thing is I haven't had chest pain since he put the stent in.  This med is taken at night, so sleepyness/dizzyness isn't a problem.  The problem is WEIGHT GAIN.  I do aerobic exercise (elliptical) 45mins to and hour every day and I eat fruit and veggies and fish as well daily, I am trying to lose weight and I am gaining weight.  It is very distressing.",5,1,3

So I started breaking them in half and watchin my blood pressure and it's workin my feet and leggs are feeling better and I cound't be happier as I've with my feet and legs hurting for a long timee.  So I started readin on here and seen many others were havin the problem with this med.   So anyway I broke the pill in half and am only takin 12.5 mg and I'm gettin better.  My heart beat is a little higher 135/80 but I feel better and I'm happy with the bottom number.",3,3,3
Have taken this med since 2001 and feet and just above the ankles have been tingling and achy leg musles and this med is the only thing I'm taking that I think is causing this.,4,3,4

I have always had HBP.  My doctor started me on Toprol 75MG.  That was 6 years ago and I am at the 200MG level now and am finally at the BP I want to be at 120/70.  Great drug and have not had any side effects to date.,5,5,5
"I was doing 50 mg x 2 / day, but it made me very sleepy.  It was keeping my heart rate way down.  When I rode my bicycle, I was always out of breath. Doc cut it back to 1xday and it's better.  Intense dreams?  Oh, yeah.  It's like an LSD trip and an alnight pass to to the freak show.  I had to learn that if I woke up and thought I should do something, I should think again.  And if I lay back down, the next show will soon start.  But, intense dreams are OK with me.  And the REM sleep is all good.  This ought to be a sleep dis-order med.",5,4,4

When I told my doctor that the side effects were taking a pronounced toll, he just said that I had to work through the side effects. If I had known how terrible the side effects were, I would have never started taking it. As it is, I have reduced my intake by 1/2 a pill each night, otherwise I would be unable to perform my duties at work.

I have lost a good 70% already.  I also have experienced considerable cognitive decline and memory loss.

I urge anyone who cannot control their BP with a DASH diet and nice exercise to go ahead and take a beta-blocker.  Taper on slowly, keep in mind that they will make you a bit tired at first, and if you get evil side effects, get a different beta-blocker from your Dr.  Every person is different -- they react differently to various drugs!

To those who haven't started taking yet, DON'T. Too many side effects. I have decided to take my own advice and start treating my BP with diet and exercise.

I went back to my regular doctor, i he took me off of it and put me back on calcium channel blockers, and had to prescribe Paxil CR to me before my depression would start to improve. Toprol XL and all other Beta Blockers are poison as far as i am concerned...and this crap didn't even lower my blood pressure one bit. They did help the migraine problem, but i had rather have migraines than go through what i did with severe depression. I never had a problem with depression until i took Toprol XL. ",1,1,1

This also happended when walking up hills and stairs.  I still have shortness of breath but the pressure is not as bad.  I also get dizzy, but that could also be the lack of blood in my body.

This happened within about a week of taking this drug and still occurs.  I'm used to it and sometimes it'll spook me and sometimes it's funny, usually I just go back to sleep.  Very weird.

The dreams are so disturbing that I cannot go back to sleep after wards for hours and sometimes not at all out of fear. Not nightmares about scary monsters or murderers, no.

I need to take this medication for frequent tachycardia.  I am now up to 175 mg daily. I can't take more than 50 mg at one time because I get 'zoned' out; so my doctor told me to cut in half and take 4 times a day.  This seems to work so well and I don't feel funny.  Works for me!,5,5,5
got on mainly for missing heartbeats. works well for blood pressure but not as well for missing beats...doctor wants to try me on VERAPAMIL ER 240 MG. I will see...maybe will do better inslead of TOPROL. ALSO so far lack of sex drive and lots of aches on TOPROL.,4,3,4

"I've taken Toprox XL for about 8 yrs now, for the prevention of supraventicular tachycardia events, after I ended up in the hospital during an attack that I couldn't stop. The drug has been very effective in preventing SVT episodes. I also have hypertension, and take two additional drugs for that. I took 100 mg Toprol XL once a day but a few years ago noticed I was having some asthma-like symptoms. My doctor decreased the Toprox XL to 50 mg/day, added another blood pressure med, and I no longer have respiratory problems. That's the only side effect I ever had with Toprol XL, but only at the higher dosage. It's a good thing, too, as the docs tell me that I will likely need the Toprol to control the SVT for the rest of my life. ",4,4,5
"I take the generic for occasional situational anxiety and it works like magic.  I go from shaking nerves and uncontrollable heartbeat to a calm state in just a few minutes.  This is off label and my Dr. was even skeptical of the near instantaneous nature of the effect. He recommended I take it daily.  But that is definitely not necessary for this off label indication.  Anybody who experiences ""high anxiety"" in a few specific situations once in a while should definitely take this.  Furthermore, after using it a couple of times for a particular situation, I have noticed that a the situation that previously caused uncontrollable nerves often becomes less traumatic to the point of no longer needing the medicine or not even thinking of it.",5,5,5
"it has helped me lower my blood pressure, but is it better to take at night, because it makes me very tired.  100 mg.  can you take half in the morning and half at night",5,5,5

Sounds like I have no oxygen to form words. People think I have COPD.I have been taken to the hospital twice(most recently 2 weeks ago by ambulance)couldn't get my breath, no air. Had all the tests, my heart was not the problem. Doctors at the hospital were not listening to the feeling of lack of oxygen symptoms, as my tests are showing 100% oxygen in my blood stream. I get to go to the clinic this coming wen. New doctor, mabey she will listen. I have also started with great foot pain in my heels and numbness in my right arm. There is always the possibility that this is not due to toprol, however these prob didn't start until my toprol started. Also my vision has required new prescriptions twice this last year.

Was put on Toprol XL 50mg, went through the usual light headedness, dizzyness, etc. had broaderline high bloodpressure 150/160 over 85/98 pressure - heart rate always in the 80's at rest. Dr increased to 100mg still the same, then increased to 200mg each day. Never really brought BP down that much from normal(Dr wanted BP at 117-120/75-78)... For about 5 1/2 years, I've complained of shortness of breath just from walking short distances, trouble sleeping, blurry vision(worse in the morning), swelling of feet/hands, gas/bloating, fatigue, numbness in hands at waking in mornings, moodyness, weight gain(50lbs), hair loss, Sex drive/ED and now, the shortness of breath is so bad, they claim that I've come down with adult onset asthma but can't control that cause I'm still on 200mg of Toprol XL that might be contributing to the breathing problems (or maybe not even have asthma?).... How to get off of it now?  Primary Care doctor wants me off, don't think the cardiologist wants to bother, just like the pulmonary Dr....They would rather get me on an inhaler and be done with it!!!",4,1,2

I tried several other drugs and this one seems to be the best for me. I found out I had HBP when I was pregnant with my first child 3 1/2yrs ago(my pregnancy was rough-had preclampsia and toximia). My OB said that I could not go to full term or there was a chance I could loose my life and the baby's, so my daughter was born 7wks early via c-section. I was also told that it was not wise for me to have another child due to this problem. I never knew I had HBP until we figured out that I was born with only one kidney(via ultrasound and testing through Dartmouth Hospital) and that kidney was working too hard by itself. All these years I have always had HBP and they told me and my mom while I was growing up is that I had the ""white coat syndrome""-afraid of Dr's, but if I had not been pregnant I would have never knew I was going to have this issue for the rest of my life.

Also given to me were HCTZ and Lipitor. Within a day I was very ill (nausea and vomiting) and blood work showed liver enzymes out of whack! My primary care doctor took me off the drugs and sent me to a heart specialist. Under the care of the heart specialist (for 18 months) no heart problem was found. My liver enzymes continued to be abnormal. Seven years later, my blood pressure was 128/75 at my last physical. I have two other high blood pressure incidents since the first...one due to a compression fracture of the spine, after a fall; and recently during a bout of bronchitis with extreme coughing.

Actually it was the opposite. The generic for toprol was recalled due to size differences in the pills. Torprol XL is still being dispensed. Got some just yesterday.

The doctor increased the Toprol to 100 mg.  Recently I started having symptoms that I attributed to cold symptoms. I have been very sleepy- not tired- sleepy. I would pass out on my sofa after work, and then fall asleep on the sofa again at 8 PM until it was time to get up and go to bed. I would even close my eyes while I took my daily walk because I was so sleepy. I also had dyspnea at the slightest exertion. I also had severe sacral pain and muscle pain in my thighs. I don't take any statin medication, so I couldn't understand why I was having so much musculoskeletal pain. I decreased my dosage to 50 mg daiily and experienced immediate relief. My dyspnea is better, I feel more alert, and my sacral pain is gone. Toprol is a medication that must be reduced gradually, so be sure to see your doctor if you're having any side effects.",5,1,5

This substitute is not working.",3,2,3
"The pharmacy told me that the generai was recalled. I was reading on the web about the side effects of the generic, fatigue, anxiety , irregular heartbeats and other things. I've been on it since June and I was wondering why I felt so bad all the time and I was only taking 50mg per day. I was on the brand name and there is a difference. I argued with the doctor and got him to ok the brand name. I was son the brand name before and thigs were ok.  I read that the manufactuer of the generic  was reported for poor quality control and documentation of processes. What the heck was the FDA doing for all this time. The complaints aren't new they have been receiving them for a while is what I'm told. So the generic is off the market and it was recalled. The pharmacys all lie and say it is back ordered, but I don't think it is comming back at all.",5,4,4

"The generic blood pressure causes sleepless nights, anxious thoughts, forgetfulness, no energy, totally exhausted.  My daughter has to help me even walking to the bathroom most times because I feel so exhausted all the time.  When I asked my doctor to give me the brand name he declined.  I called my pharmacy and they told me Metoprolol is being taken off the market in April, but they had not heard of it being recalled.",4,2,2
MY PHARMACY INFORMED ME THAT THIS DRUG HAD A RECALL ON IT AND I HAD TO BE PUT ON LOPRESSOR INSTEAD. DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THIS RECALL?,5,5,5
It seem to work for a while theb ny bloodpressure took of again. The doctor increased the doseage but it did not effect my rising bloodpressure. So the doctor switched to another drug that did control it ,4,3,4
"I have been on the real stuff, not generic and my pressure went from 150/101 to 122/82/ I had some side pain and now some back discomfort but I think it is unrelated. Feels more like a sore back because of the cold weather. It will make you tired so take it at night before bed. I seem to pee more too but not much than before with all the coffee I drink! I think this works for me so I'll stay on it until it doesn't work any more.Don't listen to all the bad stories.I was on another pill and had a mild case of ED. Never got a hard erection. This brought it back but I still have lost a bit of the desire. Before all these pills I had no problem staying hard or being ready.",5,5,5
The TOPROL/METOPROLOL recall is mainly for the generic drug which is manufactured by ETHEX pharm. and SANDOZ pharm. The generic manufactured by PAR pharmaceutical is OK. The brand drug TOPROL-XL is manufactured by Astra Zeneca pharm. and I understand that PAR pharm. is also alligned with Astra Zeneca. either one appears a good choice. These generic (junk pills) were investigated and reported by both CONSUMER LABS (White Plains NY) and THE PEOPLES PHARMACY in April of last year. What was the FDA doing??? ,4,4,4
"I was started on another blood pressure medication which was causing problems, so my doctor switched me to toprol XL. I have very good results with this medication. It took a week or so for my body to adjust to it, which the Doctor explained to me from the beginning. My druggest switched me to the generic brand which was not a good thing, the generic drug does not work for me. My doctor has to write dispense as written on every prescription or the drug store will give you the generic form. I have been on this medication for almost 3 years now and it has made a big difference in my life.              ",5,5,5
Quit taking this med after I fell asleep while driving. I took that particular dose 13 hrs. previous.  Constant fatigue and drowsiness. Almost like I had narcolepsy. Felt better after out of my system. I must mention this was the generic version. Has this happened to anyone else? And did the name brand help you with these side affects?,4,1,3
"I have been using this for over 7 years and the prescription version has been effective until now. I tried the generic but it didn't work. Only since my last refill has the prescription version been working like the generic. My blood pressure is up, my heart beat is irregular; it's like I'm not taking anything at all. I came here to learn what might be wrong and find someone says it's being ""quietly recalled"". Why quietly? Why hasn't my Doctor or Pharmacist notified me? I'm going to call my Doctor as soon as he opens but where can I go to find out more information? I did use the pill identifier to verify the markings match the prescription but something is obviously wrong and I have been endangered by it. If you're taking this, ask your Doctor if he/she's heard of a recall. Thankfully there is a site like this where I can get information at 5 AM. ",1,1,1

I have tachycardia. My heart doctor prescribed this to me about 5 1/2 years ago. I had positive results with toprol. I can no longer get it from my pharmacist.??It was very convenient to take.( at bedtime)I'm hoping I will be able to use it again. ,5,5,5

"i started out on the generic.. it was awful.weight gain,dry mouth,headaches.finally my dr put me on the name brand. it works very well.lost the weight and the ""flutters"" are gone.have dropped dose in half and doing good.found out the binders in the generic was the cause of side effects.",5,5,5
"i first started this med because of anxiety and palpatations, used it for 2 plus years the past four mnths have been experiencing extreme hair loss lost about 50 percent! my endocrinologist suggested that is was the toprol, i am hopeful that now that i will discontinue this loss will stop there are other drugs out there for anxiety, losing my hair has caused nothing but anxiety!",5,1,3
"The brand works best for me.  I used the generic for several months only to find that my sx increased, palpatations.  I was going to increase my dose; thinking drug was ineffective at 50mg but saw an article in the prevention magazine about generic drugs.  Toprol xl was one of the drugs discussed in the article.  The author stated that if the generic was not produced by a certain (can't remember the name)pharmacutical co. you may experience increased sx.  I finished the generic then refilled the med with the brand toprol xl.  After a couple doses I noticed that my sx were under control again.  I was so excited when toprol went generic I thought I could save money but I'd rather pay more for the brand than feel awful.  I am a believer in generics but in this case it didn't work for me.

"I was diagnosed with high BP a year ago which was a complete surprise since I've always been very thin, healthy and reasonably active& only 38.  I started taking generic metoprolol by Sandoz- and at first felt really good- it lowered my BP, plus completely eliminated headaches, chestpain& tightness.  However, after 2 months I became extremely exhausted, I began having episodes of numbness& tingling in arms and legs at night and suddenly gained 10 pounds all around the middle. By month 10, I was waking up several times a night with my arms and legs heavy and numb.  Finally I requested the Brand Name TOPROL XL. I've been taking it for 2 months and feel MUCH better.  My energy is back, the numbness&tingling has decreased significantly, and hopefully now I will also start to get rid of that weight around the middle!  It is my personal theory that perhaps the generic metoprolol released the dose too quickly, dropping my BP so much at night that my arms&legs ""fell asleep"" due to lack of circulation- sometimes my AM BP was 85/55. Then I'm thinking maybe my body released a bunch of cortisol to raise my BP again- which contributed to my weight gain around the middle.  My doctor disagrees and suggested I see a neurologist.  Is there any other MD out there who thinks I could be on the right track?  I would suggest to anyone prescribed this med to first try the BRAND NAME TOPROL XL for at least 3 months to see how you react to it and what to expect before using a generic.",5,3,5
"I've been taking toprolxl 25 mg for a year now.Been on name brand and then the generics by sandoz and ethenex.Those two generics do not work and they made my chest hurt.I found an article in the doctors office about generic toprol xl and it said the only generic that is exactly the same as the name brand is par pharmisutical by astrazenica.So I asked the doctor about this and he said it is the only generic one you should take,Of course he never mentioned this before until I asked.So now be sure to ask at the pharmacy who makes the generic they carry.Ifeel much better now.",4,4,4
I have been on the generic for toporolxl.  Sometimes my heart races and my bp is inconsistent with it.  Using it for just 4 weeks.  Experiencing weakness in legs and arms.  Wondering if it is the med or maybe my body still adjusting to it.,4,2,2
"I have been on this medication for 7 years. I started at 25 mg,then upped the dose to 50 and am now on 100 mg. Taking it now at bedtime, to help with the fatigue.

Been taking med for 3 years.  It has completely stopped palpitations.  Heartbeat lowered to 60's but BP remains a bit high 130's/90's.  Biggest side effect was weight gain but Dr insist it has nothing to do with med.  Mild loss in sex drive and hair loss but not sure if associated with med or aging.,5,4,3

"while taking this med, I have encounter tremendous amount of fatigue and heaviness.  I am so very sleepy all day long and it seem like I am just sleeping my precious hours away. But I do understand that it takes time to get used to a new medication.  My Cardiologist wants to increase this medication to twice daily....that will take a tremendous toll on my waking hours, but in the next few months I believe that the cost of the fatigue will overall be more of a benefit to my condition than not, and as us patients understand the process of new medication it will just take time for us to get used to the new med....and than our bodies will adjust to the side effects and we will have a better enhancement of life.",5,3,3
"It has worked great at 25mg for my PVCs.  However, blood pressure is still high, triglycerides are high, feet & toes tingle, legs & hips hurt waking me up at night, and weight gain around the waist!!  Gee what fun side effects!!  Dr. is taking me off this med tomorrow and increase my Aceon instead.  Am happy about getting rid of the Toprol especially since readers that other users have been having the same side effects.  When you mention these to your physician or nurse they are absolutely clueless!!!  This is very disturbing.  ",5,4,5
I started taking this about a monthe ago not real sure about its effectiveness yet but my blood pressure was so high before that it caused an anyerysm and stroke i am 44 years old so i will try anything to keep my b/p down.  I am lucky to be alive.,4,3,4

I have been on this drug for almost three years. I hate having to take it every day and my blood pressure is not going down it seems more constant and stable but its not helping it any. I also had racing heart so that is another reason I have been put on it and that has not happened since I have been on it but I am tired of taking it. I can't loose any weight since I have started taking it. I have actually gained weight and now I have to take Prilosec or the purple pill daily to maintain my tummy. It just sucks!!!,3,2,3

He left me on Toprol XL (generic) to help keep blood pressure down.    My sex drive is dead, but I have not gained weight, had abnormal hair loss, joint pain, etc.  I do have memory problems, though.

"The first 4 months left me tired and listless, then woke up one day and felt great. Have been great ever since, until the metoporol generic came out.  Now the insurance companies claim the cheap one is ""preferred"" and covered.  Unfortunately, have tried it twice and it is definitely NOT the same. Blood pressure was unstable, got headaches, and the drug wore off half way through the day.  Paying the extra thinking generic metoporol is a lie. You get what you pay for, except with health insurance of course.",5,5,5

I have been taking this medicaion for a few years and to be honest it has never really worked that great. I have gained a bunch of weight and I am constantly tired. My feet have been a constant problem form the tingly, numbness to severe pain in my ankle joints. It dawned on m that it could be medication related and upon others reiews I think I may be on the right track.

I still have occassional headaches, pounding chest, and fatigue. But now something weird is happening with my hearing, and my eyes are 'crazy.' I also cannot stay awake.  Overall though, it's better than feeling like I'm having a heart attack.",4,3,3
"I am 51 and have been on Toprol XL for 5+ years.  If I miss a dose I will suffer with headache & extreme fatigue.  I have had to take Prilosec every day since I started because of indigestion & heartburn.  I have noticed lately my hands go numb at night and have a shortness of breath more often.

"I've been on toprol for about 4 years and thought it effective for my high bp but it also made me gain quite a bit of weight. This week I spoke to my cardiologist and told him I wanted off the pills because of the weight gain and he told me it's not the toprol that makes me gain weight but that I was out of shape and shoould exercise more. I told him I would if I weren't so tired all the time. He then told me that one of the side affects of toprol is fatigue and since my stress test came back really good he would take me off the drug but I have to ween off it,one week half a pill one week quarter of pill one half a quarter. So far so good. I'm feeling much better, more energy and thanks to the help of weight watchers I've lost 2.6 lbs this week. If my pressure goes back up the dr. said he'll increase my water pill.",4,2,4
A few years ago took drug for high blood pressure.  After had taken for awhile began to have shortness of breath and pounding of heart with physical exertion. Also experienced severe head aches especially in back of head. Was fatigued with no energy.  Heart rate was low.  Finally had to go to ER and heart rate was in 40's and BP ok. ER doctor thought was Toprol and called family physicial.  Had heart test to elimination heart problems.  Was taken off Toprol and symptons began to disappear very soon.  Now taking Avalide and Verapamil which working well.,5,1,1
"I had been taking Toprol XL (name brand) for years with no problem.  After Thyroid Cancer Surgery and radioactive iodine treatments something changed.  I was constantly tired, lost a lot of hair, my eyes have been a mess blurred vision and constant tearing, tingling in my legs and hands.  The sympton became worse when the doctor raised the dosage from 25 mg to 50 mg.  I have since stoped and now I'm on a different medicine which I'm not sure is going to be any better.  At first the doctor wouldn't believe these symptons were from the Toprol until I forced the issue.",5,1,3
"I have been taking Toprol XL for about 5 years. When they came out with the generic last year I was switched to the generic Metroprol. This medication was prescribed for high blood pressure. It has no effect on the blood pressure, but does slow the heart rate down and make the heart beat with less force. It seems the side effects increased with the change to Metoprolol. I also take an ACE inhibitor and an Alpha  blocker, Terazosin. The Alpha blocker is the only medication that has lowered the pressure much at all, but still too high and the effect only lasts for 3-4 hours. I have Diastolic Heart Failure and Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) with some Atheriosclerosis. These 2 conditions lead to a reduced blood flow rate. All of the traditional antihypertensive medications make the flow rate even lower and are mostly ineffective in reducing the blood pressure. The internal organs sense the reduced flow rate as a reduction in oxygen in the blood stream and do everything they can to raise the flow rate, which usually exceeds the effect of the medication and the blood pressure goes back up. So those of you that have unsatisfactory pressure reduction and side effects from your medications, look at the symptoms of low blood pressure and you will find they match your side effects. You probably have diastolic dysfunction, your heart does not allow enough blood into the chambers to be pumped out. Good luck convincing your doctor to even consider this possibility, it goes against what they were taught in Med School. Also there are no procedures for this or medications. Exercise, weight deduction, limiting salt intake help lower pressure, but do little to increase the flow rate.",4,2,2

"I am a 21 year-old female that has been on this medication for almost a year. A little over a year ago, I began randomly fainting. I assumed it was just low blood sugar the first few times and did not seek medical attention. After the fainting became more frequent and began to worry me, I decided to go to the doctor. It took months of tests and several missed college classes, but I was finally diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome and put on this medication. Since I have taken it, I have not fainted, because my blood pressure and heart rate have regulated(their irregularity is what was causing the fainting). I have only experienced minor side effects from the medication, such as crazy dreams and very minor weight gain(which may be associated with getting older and not having a teenage metabolism anymore), but overall the benefits have far out-weighed the side effects for me! I'm not the type of person who takes medication for everything, in fact, I rarely take medication for anything, so being told that I may have to take this pill for the rest of my life was very scary to me. But, if it keeps me standing upright, I guess ""I gotta do what I gotta do"".",4,5,5

Made my feet feel like they have ice water in them and they are either numb or tingling. Also the medicine also makes my heart feel like it is tightening up and beat real fast.

"I have found that the 25 mg 1x daily has lowered my bp. Any weight gain is due to my lack of exercise which I should be doing. I do feel tired, but I think that is due to the lack of exercise. I am wondering how many who wrote of feeling tired and low energy are overweight and do not do enough exercise-walking 3x week (I know, I just don't always do.). However, I have felt weak and lightheaded, but I wonder if it was caused by my eating foods that had sodium in it (visiting family & friends, eating what they eat; going out and eating in restaurants who salt the food even if you request that they don't). When I control my food preparation and use either no salt or low salt seasoning, my bp is fine.  If I get adequate water that is important.  I am trying to take my medication on time, do not drink any alcoholic beverages and cook with salt or with very low salt seasonings. I do some walking.   I do have some numbness in my hands when I sleep on them-but I will pay attention to if it happens when I am not sleeping or lying on them.  Sometimes I get a rebound headache-but again, I think that happens when I am not drinking enough water. If I am drinking water-not just liquids-I don't seem to have those problems.  But all the comments are very helpful, and I can be on the lookout for things that may occur.  Overall, I am satisfied with the way the medication works.",5,5,5
"I started taking Toprol XL when i was 19 for problems with my heart racing since then my heart has slowed down but after taking only 25 mg , im having to move up to 50 mg , so now im a little concerned that my body may stop responding to this med hopefully not, but so far this medicine has been great in controlling my heart rate i recommend people that have the same problem give this medicine a try being a little tired for the med is way better than feeling like youve been running for 2 hours by the way your heart is running with you!

Had 85% clog in circumflex artery and the Toprol slowed down my pulse and caused the problem.  My doctor did not want me to stop taking it but when I saw a cardiologist he said quit taking it as it was slowing down the blood to my heart because it lowered my pulse and he put a stent in the artery.  Told me my blood pressure was ok.  I had a blood pressure monitor at home and my blood pressure was averaging 120/70.  Be careful what your doctor tells you-see a cardiologist!,1,1,1

"I've been on Tribenzor for over five years. There have been no directly attributable side effects. My BP is steady at 120-130 over ~80. I had swelling of one leg before taking the drug, and I have swelling of one leg now. I tried other BP medication prior to starting on Tribenzor and had a variety of side effects, none of which were acceptable. Any changes in physical ability or mental acuity I've experienced since beginning treatment with Tribenzor could just as easily be addressed as ""simply getting older,"" or the natural effects of aging. For me, this medication has been helpful and clearly of benefit.",5,5,5
 I started taking Tribenzor when my blood pressure was 200/120. It helps lower my blood pressure back to normal levels within the first month. It certainly helps lowering blood pressure. But I have experienced a side effect not listed on this drug. I have contracted Raynaudâ??s syndrome.  The reason I know this is because I contracted it with in the first month of taking this medicine. I lost my insurance for two years so I couldnâ??t take it and my Raynauds went away. Last year I got my insurance back and started taking Tribenzor again. My Raynaudâ??s syndrome came back with full force. I cannot take this medicine again.  Raynaudâ??s syndrome causes blood vessels to shrink making your fingertips toes and nose and tongue turn white and feel numb. If you are experiencing this check with your doctor. ,5,1,5
"I tied tribenzor for 2 weeks, I was also on a diabetic pill which is not suppose to be taking together. Tribenzor will mask your sugar dropping, this also made me nervous, nausea, joint pain.

"Taking this drug for 3 years now. I have mixed feelings about it. Yes, my B/P is reasonable, in the 130's over 70's/80's, with a pulse in the mid/high 50's. The cost is very high - I'm on 40-5-12.5 mg. - even though I'm on Medicare. Side effects: hard to determine about hair lose as I age, but it is thinning; leg hair is almost all gone, bowel movements 2-3 times per day; leg cramps if I don't take in fluids; up twice a night to urinate - no prostrate issue my doctor says. Concerned about long term usage with this or any drug. Have tried other B/P drugs, had dizziness, low energy levels, and frequent cough on others. ",5,3,5

Been using it now for 3 weeks and my blood pressure is back to normal 115/65 today.  It was running 165/80 or less for about a month.  I had used diovan hct for over 10 years so think I just needed a change.  My blood pressure was good until about 3 months before I started the tribenzor and it just started being high every time I took it.  Hope this keeps working.,5,4,4
"I used to take Diovan before I started this medicine but my BP was still high (155/78 to 185/90). I started Tribenzor about a month ago and it really works well for me. My daily pressure runs between 117/76 to 130/80 even after running around all day.

"Only been taking for 120 days, but BP is best ever, actually a little low.  No side-effects that I am aware of yet.",5,5,5
"My blood pressure was shy high before I started taking this drug. Now, my blood pressure has been slightly lower than normal for the last two years. Great medication!",5,5,5
"I started taking this medication in September of 2011. By October I started experiencing extreme shortness of breathe. By December of 2011 I was experiencing chest pain, swelling in ankles and legs and pain in shoulder and arms. I also started experiening muscle cramps and having no sex drive. Hair loss/thinning came a couple of months later. In 2013 I suffered a mild heart attack while on this medication. No longer taking Tribenzor and I am feeling a lot better since doctor took me off this medication. ",1,1,1
" BP 120/70 now.   My pulse became high within two days of taking Tribenzor. I was previously taking Bystolic, and others. I  continued Bystolic low dose every other day with Tribenzor for two weeks to lower my pulse.  My pulse is getting lower as I continue to take tribenzor alone. ",4,4,5
I have been on a lot of medicine for b/p but this the worst one yet dihere lost of hair swelling there isn't anything I can say  good for  this drug,2,1,3
"My third review: I have been on tribenzor for 2 1/2 years now, the only lasting side effects I have had are leg cramps at night, caused by dehydration, just have to drink more water, can't be out in the sun for too long, results in easy burn and headaches,occasional shortness of breath, occasional constipation, once again have to drink more water. I have ""not"" had any hair loss. In 2 years I have lost and kept off 70 lbs., altered my diet, you should always take the pill with food. But the key here is always water. Keep hydrated, especially in summer, try to match input with output. Gatorade is a good supplement. In short the med works fine for me. You just have to help it by helping yourself, alter habits, diet and exercise. Good luck to all.",5,5,5
I have been on this drug for almost 2 yrs. now and my blood pressure is doing well. I started off with 210/115 and it came down to 120/75 within a week. I experience a little dizzyness and it does bother my stomach in the morning after I take it and it does last for an hour or more. ,3,3,5
"I can't really rate the effectiveness, I took only ONE dose of this.  It was the drug from ""H.""  I was dizzy, had a headache, my eye balls ached, I had diarrhea and nausea and joint pain.  Within a few days I had bronchitis and my shoulder hurt.  The bronchitis and shoulder pain, which I thought was bursitis, took a couple of days to manifest.  Everything else appeared within several hours and disappeared 24 to 30 hours after the dose. A horrible, horrible medication. ",3,1,3
  I have been on this medication for two years now.When I first started taking BP was 194/101.Now my Bp runs 120/86. I had tried several medications before Tribenzor but none was successful. After reading side affects I was a afraid but I needed help.I have had No side affects from this medication.I am very happy to take one pill a day and have starting walking and loosing weight,5,5,5
"It works well at controlling my blood pressure, but I sometimes have numbness and tingling up and down both arms and across my chest.  The numbness is accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness.  I also sometimes have trouble sleeping in spite of being on prescription sleeping pills (doxepin), which worked well before I started taking tribenzor.",5,2,5
After trying several medications this worked well in bringing down my BP.  The problem is that after about a week I was so depressed I couldn't stand it. Stopped taking it and depression went away.,5,1,4
"on BP med for a year after replacement valve surgery, worked well for me bp 125/85, no swelling,no breathing problems,no pain, had significant hair loss. I was pleased all three in one pill.  ",5,4,4
I have been on this medication for about a year. I cannot take the 40 mg dosage because of extreme dizziness but the lower dosage works well enough.,5,4,4
"After trying several BP meds, my Doc put me on Tribenzor.  My BP dropped from 160-170/120-135 to around 120/80.  Last time I saw him it was 106/60.  No side effects. Been on it for approx. 2 years.",5,5,5

Beware this drug!!",3,1,3
"I had 160/120 bp prior to getting the doses.After a month on the med, I am 110/70, however my resting heart rate used to be 70 know its 100-120. I am great shape and exercise at 5 days a week 2 twice a day. Power-lifter.  ",3,2,5
"Muscle cramps in my legs, shoulder pain-feels like rotator cuff injury. Tiredness, zero sex drive. Can't lose weight or exercise.  ",4,1,2

"I have been using Tribenzor 40/10/25 for about a year to control high blood pressure. This drug works great to maintain my BP  avaeage 115/65. Lately my hair has been breaking off, I am done with this drug.",4,4,4
"Blood pressure went from 180+/110 to 135/85, after first day. Pressure is holding steady at 125/80 after 4 days. I do feel like I am more tired than usual, though.",5,4,5

i have side effects that i can not explain since taking this medication ,4,4,4
"I have been on tribenzor for about 3 weeks. It is the first blood pressure med to work.  I must have tried 10 different BP meds.  I have slight swelling of ankles and feet, stomach cramps, and a great deal of hair loss. The hair loss is upsetting me greatly.  Does anyone know if this hair loss stops? My blood pressure has gone from 190/80 to 118/68.  I guess my choice is to be bald or be infirmed!!",5,3,5
"After trying this medication for two months the results were no different for lowering my blood pressure than taking Lisinopril.  Actually the Lisinopril worked better in that there were no ill side effects as with the Tribenzor such as edema in the legs, ankles, feet, face, lips, and eyes.  Dizziness and headaches were also associated with the use of this drug.",4,2,2
works better than anything else I tried,5,5,5
"I am in my 2nd year of using Tribenzor, and a few months ago my hair started thinning out. I am not sure that is the cause, but I have never had this problem before. This medication has worked wonderful for my blood pressure.",5,5,5
This medicine has worked very well for me.I did not have any side affects that i noticed.,5,5,5
This medicine has worked wonderful for me.I am trying this medicine because my insurance did not want to pay for what I was taken before.I pray that I stay on this medication.,5,5,5
"I have been taking Labetalol for over 7 yrs but it is no longer enough.  After trying several different meds, this one finally lowers my BP.  On the day I was given this drug, my BP was 168/112.  Just after 7 days it is down to 119/81 which is where my BP used to be.  I'm very happy to feel like my old-self again.  The only side-effect I've noticed is sun sensitivity. (I should be wearing sunscreen anyway.)",5,5,4
"Four months ago I started this drug at 20-5-12.5, I felt lightheaded and dizzy, my BP went from 160/87 down to 112/69. Doc said to cut the pill in half so I did. BP had stabilized since then. Side effects: I am losing a lot of hair, I am experiencing shoulder joint pain that, to open the car door to get out made me cry, (the pain is terrible but is not always), knee pain, and just recently my rt leg was swollen from the ankle to the knee after I walked 5 miles that day. I was to see my doctor yesterday but the swelling is gone after 2 days. If stiffness and joint pain persists I will have to see my doctor and possibly change to a different medication.",5,4,4
It's easy to take and seems as effective as any other BP meds I have taken.  It is too high to pay for without the one year introductory card provided by the manufacturer ( $25 for each month's supply). I won't be able to afford it after the first year.  Other meds have worked just as well - I took this one because I changed doctors and he wanted to try the samples on me thinking it might work well.  It works fine but no better than the others,5,3,4
"So far, this medication has really help lower my high blood pressure.",5,4,4
"On it 6 months now and will soon go to doctor the talk about it and do blood work. Lowered pressure from 160/90 to 119/77. I don't like the effects of the diuretic. I wake up with cracked lips and tire easily when working out of doors in heat, no sweat. I live in FL. I plan to talk with my doctor about taking the drugs separately without the diuretic.",4,3,5
I have had extremely high blood pressure over 170/110 and lisinopril was not working. I switched to this one and the second day it was down to 140/90 and the third day it was 124/78....Awesome!  I feel better and less swollen. Today is the 4th day and Im still fine...hopefully I will not notice any side effects as the days go by but so far I feel like a new person!!! :),5,5,5
"I took this medication once daily for 6 days. It did lower my blood pressure approximately 10 points both systolic and diastolic. However I was awakened at night with severe muscle cramps in legs and feet and developed muscles twitching in my arms and hands during the daytime which lasted the entire time that I took this medication. My doctor had me discontinue this and return to my previous meds.  The muscle cramps in my lower extremities immediatly stopped but I still have the twitching in my arms, some 3 weeks later, which I never had before with any other medication. PROS: does lower blood pressure. CONS: attacks the muscles. Definitely not worth the risk, at least for me.",5,1,2
"Have been on this med for about 2 months.  It has definitely helped lower my BP, but I have experiencedjoint pains and now an itchy rash.  Will need to visit MD again.",4,3,4
"immediate reduction in blood presure, but elevated heart rate... I work outside in So. FL.  Heart rate may be related to getting my blod to the skin surface for cooling.  I don't know.  Just had blood work, will see my DR. in a week or so and discuss it.  BTW I'm 58 6' tall very large frame & 230 lbs.  Could stand to loose 25-35 LBS and am working on it (down from 257)",5,5,5
I used to to take Amlodipine and suffered aches and pains.  I told the dolctor and with a separate pill for water retention(Hydrochlorot)i began to feel great.  I was fine then the doctor recommended I combine them by taking Tribenzor.  Now i feel the aches and pains again. My sex drive has dimiished even more. ,3,1,3
Do NOT take this medicine without food.  First three times I took this medicine (between meals) my BP went to >200/110.  Started taking it with meal - no spike in BP.,5,3,4

"I have been on this B/P med for 4 months. Excellent med keeps my B/P at a constant low ranging from 90/70 to 106/62. Where previous it was HIGH ranging from 170/100 to 190/106. I too experience some lightheadness, some tiredness and dizziness. However, I recently found out through a fasting blood test that this med may be affecting my kindey functions. After reviewing the possible/rare side effects of this med I discovered that    this med can cause kidney diease and/or kidney failure. I will need to review other B/P med options with my MD any get off this med as it is causing my Creatine levels to be out of the normal range. Normal range is .59-1.07. I am currently at 1.50. Which means if these numbers continue to increase  to 2.0 only 50% of my kindeys will be working. Not good and very scarey. Not all meds are good for you, even though they do the job! Be aware and always stay on top of all your meds and possible/rare side effects that can cause damage down the road and or possible death.",5,2,5
"Have been nervous or jittery, wondering if this is from the drug",5,3,5

"I was diagnose hypertensive at age 57  4 years ago. My doctor put me on several medications to control my high blood pressure, (5) to be more precis about it. That is about 1+ per year and finally ""Tribenzor"" ! It has so far been the most effective for me. Be patient, don't get frustrated. I was told in the beginning it might be several different drugs until they level your pressure and it did in fact take a while,WOW Finally Tribenzor.",5,5,5
Been on this medication for 7 days.  BP 139/73 .... better results than most meds.  Two side effects...muscle cramps and chest pains.  Took two excedrin on fifth day and they went away.

Current side effects dizziness,low bp, constipation(mostly due to dehydration)minor chest pain and shortness of breath(mostly while sitting for periods(goes away when i get up and walk around)minor short lived headaches, and dry mouth cough. My Dr. feels these are alright since my last visit he gave me a scrip for 11 more months and said see you in a year. But over all has been doing the job. I have adjusted my diet, and take daily 30 minute walks. I have gone from 270 lbs. to 238 lbs. in the 2 months and still losing, also stopped drinking and smoking which helps alot.

"Dangerous drug, do not use.  After 6 months ended up in hospital with permanent kidney damage (stage 3), almost killed me. Two weeks prior, my family doctor was concerned that I was showing signs of Parkinson Disease (symptoms disappeared soon after getting off Valsartan). My healthy, active father-in-law (89) was on Valsartan from August to January.  He was hopitalized in January with kidney failure, he is now dialysis, and the prognosis for survival is not good.

After taking this medication I started feeling terrible without correlating it to this. I started having numbness/tingling in my arms and legs and overall joint/muscle pain/aches. My vision gets blurry and I've noticed I've had a hard time speaking clearly (almost like I'm drunk). I'm tired all the time and I wake up with huge bags under my eyes. I've also been retaining water like crazy....my feet were really swollen the other day and they hurt. My doctor was trying to help me save money but it's not worth feeling like crap every day. After reading other people's reviews I no longer think I'm crazy.,2,1,2
"took this drug for about 1 month.  Yes, it lowered my BP, but gave me pains in my calves like I pulled a muscle.  Got so bad I could barely walk.  Stopped taking this drug and problems with calves went away.",4,1,4
"It works, was on 80mg. However, I experienced tightness in my chest, difficulty breathing, extremely low heart rate (mid 40's), and could barely stay awake while driving. I really do prefer the pharmacodynamics of this drug vs. ACE-I or CCB. But I just can't deal with the side effects.  Stopped taking, could finally breath. I wonder if another drug in the same class would have the same problems (Atacand, Cozaar)?  Anyway, I still think ARBs are great, but this one made me feel really bad.",3,2,3
"After trying a number of drugs, I found Diovan-the perfect choice-no side effects (numb feet/head aches). Took it for 5+ years. Just last month HMSA refused to cover and my cost per month would be $600! Switched to Valsartan and have headaches and pain in arms. There is no way the generic is ""the same"" as Diovan-so very frustrated. ",3,1,3
I was on Benicar and was happy with it.  My co pay was $35 a month until the generic came out and dropped it to $10.  Unfortunately I had to change medications when my insurance changed and my copay on the generic skyrocketed to $60 a month.  The Valsartan works but not as well.,3,3,3
"After trying numerous BP meds I have found Valsartin HCTZ 320/12.5 to work for me without causing ankle swelling.  I have been using it for at least 10 years, and I am well-satisfied.",5,5,5
Have been taking blood pressure medication for many years. Valsartan is by far the most effective medication I have ever taken to date. I have no side effects other than it works and works better than any other I've been on. Consistently all day every day 120's over 60's has me very happy.,5,5,5
"Was on Valsartan for 6 months, for high blood pressure. This has to be one of the most dangerous drugs out there.  I experienced achs and pains everywhere, especially in my back and hips.  I have been a weight lifer and exercise nut my whole life, but this drug made my legs so weak that I could not get up out of a chair without help. When I walked I shuffled my feet (unable to lift my legs as I walked).  My legs, arms and legs swelled, I gained 20 lbs (water weight).  My speech became so slurred that my wife thought I had a stroke.  In September I visited my family doctor, my condition was so bad he set me up to be tested for Parkinsons Disease (don't have it). In October I ended up in the hospital, almost dead.  I was being monitored 24/7 because they thought my heart was going to stop. The doctor asked my why I was taking Valsartan, he said that it was causing my body a lot of problems.  He asked if I had been monitored for kidney functions while taking the drug.  I had not. The Doctor said that I should have been monitored with a blood test at least once a month. My kidneys were only functioning at 40% because of Valsartan. At the hospital I was taken off Valsartan and given Toprol.  All my bad symptems from Valsartan have disappeared and my Kidney functions have improved. I have encountered three other people on Valsartan and they are all having bad side effects.  If you are on it, get off of it now before it ruins your life. ",3,1,3
"I'm 54 and my first time taking B/P med valsartan 40 mg, my B/P fluctuate, having serious head aches joint pains. my Dr. change it to Ramipril where my headaches and joint pains are diminishing slowly.I would not recommend it  ",1,1,1
Been on Diovan for years with no problems. Then Fallon Health tells me have to go with Valsarten (Generic) or they won't pay. B/P can be erratic at times on Valsarten. Wish I could go back to Diovan but can't. ,5,2,3
I was on Diovan for 14 years and did very well. Had to change to Valsartan because United Healthcare won't cover Diovan. I am experiencing daily headaches. I do not feel well on the generic. ,3,1,3
"I experienced a heaviness that felt like I had a boulder on my head and was walking around with it.  Also some dizziness, and MAJOR aches and pains in arms and legs, and bad headaches.  ONE DAY after getting off of Valsartin, I was back to normal, except the leg and arm shooting pains continue, but with less and less frequency.  I have been on Diovan for years without issue. I believe this is a BAD DRUG and should be taken off the market.  It's hard to exercise with all the pain in my limbs during and afterwards.  I have been off of Valsartin for about 3 months and still having problems.",5,1,4
Been on diovan at least 15 yrs with no problems.  Started valsartan 3 MO ago. BP has been high and headaches everyday. Excused high BP for anything and everything because diovan always worked with another BP pill for me. All this started shortly after taking generic pills. Thank you for this forum. Going to Dr this a.m. to switch back. How dangerous this could be if valsartan is not the same as diovan. So ridiculous how expensive diovan was before generic came out. Wonder if price went down since generic is available now. ,1,1,1
"I have taken Diovan for perhaps 10 years without any side effects. Several months ago, I changed to Valsartan 320-mg because UnitedHealthCare no longer paid for Diovan -- the difference between Diovan and Valsartan is slightly more than $200 per month. Since taken Valsartan, I have tremendous aching in legs and shoulders.",5,1,3

Now on Valsartan 160 mg have headache, slightly blurry vision, cough, and b/p 157/95.  Maybe this Valsartan is a placebo of some sort because it doesn't seem to bring my b/p down.  Pharma says I have to take the Valsartan a month before allowing the Diovan back.",3,1,1
"My doctor switched me from Lisinopril to Valsartan because of continuing orthostatic events (faintness on standing but no fainting). Took Valsartan for 14 months before taking myself off the drug.  Orthostatic events continued on valsartan and worsened. I considered wearing a helmet!  Two or three months after beginning Valsartan I began experiencing ""many"" ectopic beats, PAC's and PVC's. I'd never before experienced PVC's but did not associate with Valsartan - thought I'd strained something exercising. A Polar exercise heart monitor at one point indicated 18.5% ectopic beats immediately after a night's sleep.   Within 3 days of stopping Valsartan, the ectopic beats essentially disappeared. At two months after stopping Valsartan, I can't detect PAC's or PVC's.   Over the last 18 months I've been exercising and lost about 50 lbs - my blood pressure has remained low, typically 100/65. The orthostatic events are getting rare, a few days between events now. On Valsartan(and Lisinopril), if I sat in a chair more than 15 minutes, I planned on being faint after standing.  After two months free of Valsartan, I'm beginning to think the drug was about to kill me. I am, perhaps incorrectly, viewing the arrhythmias as a ticket to sudden heart failure.  I don't recommend that anyone stop the drug without consulting their doctor. My doctor didn't seem concerned about what I was experiencing but I perceived severe quality of life issues. I was NOT suicidal. I monitored BP closely and figured I could start taking the drug again if BP rose excessively; it did not.",4,1,1
"I've been on Diovan for 15+ years; the last 8yrs, I've been on 320-12.5mg pill. When Valsartan became available, I can say I saw a huge difference, to the negative, in my numbers. One Diovan 320-12.5mg, my blood pressure was 120/78. On Valsartan 320-12.5mg, my blood pressure is 140/90, consistently. I've talked to my doctor and will begin Edarbyclor 40-25mg. I think the Valsartan is a placebo.  ",5,1,1
"Been on this almost one year, blood pressure is sometimes fine, sometimes high. A month ago I got very dizzy and my pressure got low. Ear pressure, head pressure, severe fatigue, brain fog, more hair loss than usual and the list goes on. Went to the doctor, she added another blood pressure med and set me up for a Vestibular test. I almost convinced myself this was Mal de Debarquement from my cruise in June because many of the symptoms match. But after reading the side effects of Valsartan more closely, I'm thinking it is the cause. I'll be stopping it and letting my doctor know. I really hope I start to improve as the more severe symptoms have kept me from driving. I will post another review if my symptoms do not go away after stopping this but I really think this drug is the cause of all these issues. ",4,2,3
"I too was on Diovan, and was swtiched to Valsartan. Honestly my BP stays the same.  I've been on Valsartan for over a year, and I only take roughly 85mg.  I am usually within 117/79 even with or without 3 cups a coffee a day.  It does have side affects but so did Diovan.  Somethings you just give up and eat more Ice Cream Instead :)",4,4,4
"Like most other reviews I have read, Diovan was working fine until the switch to Valsartan.  My b/p has never been more out of control, 161/100 etc.  I believe Valsartan is just a placebo! I was taking Diovan 160, not Valsartan 320 and have even taken extra when I thought it would help.  B/P doesn't budge!  There should be a class action lawsuit against this drug!",1,1,1
"Been taking the generic now since it came out and it isn't lowering my BP at all.  Prior to this had good results with the brand name for at least 10 years 145/75, now I'm lucky if I can get to 154/95.  now trying with doxazosin and diltiazem.",4,2,2
"Converted fron Diovan to the generic Valsartan.  It's not lowering my BP at all.  I am taking 160 twice daily.  But it just does not effect my BP.  Sitting in Dr. Office right now.  Waiting for her to see what else we can do, Diovan is much to costly for me, need to make Valsartan work.",3,1,1
"This medication is dangerous. The first day, my BP spiked higher and heart rate went into the basement. After that I experienced 24 hour dizziness, severe fatigue, heart pounding, head buzzing, headache and left arm pain. One night recently I fainted and fell on the hard floor giving me a concussion. I have been off this medicine for over a week now but it still feels like it's in my system. I still have some dizziness and occasional heart pounding. This medicine almost cost me my life.",1,1,1
"I have taken Diovan for about five years, worked well, kept my BP within the normal range. Insurance switched to Valsartan less than a month ago and my BP is 160s/90s and 100s. I was only taking 80 mg of Diovan once a day. With Valsartan I doubled that when my BP was getting out of hand. My doctor now wants me to go to 320 mg of the Valsartan. I started that yesterday and have not seen a decrease in my BP yet. Just woke up with my heart POUNDING. Dangerous drug especially for someone who does not monitor their BP at home regularly. foot and hand discomfort is new since starting this. Tingling in my left arm and hand like there is no circulation. Headaches every day. Itchy all over but especially hands and feet. Definitely needs to be looked at again by the Feds. This will cost people their lives.",4,1,1
"I have taken Diovan for 10 years. My insurance changed it to Valsartan. I have been coughing for two months, lost my voice for a week, my asthma got worse, I am dizzy all the time. this drug is dangerous!!!!",3,1,3
After 30 days on meds saw a continued increase in BP (top number) till almost 195) Returned to Diovan brand name and with 3 days numbers were back to 128/72,5,1,2
I was switched from Diovan to Valsartan. Since the switch I have noticed two episodes of dizziness after getting up from a sitting position. This has occurred at least five hours after taking. I am concerned that the time release of the medication is defective in some way. The generic manufacturer has had problems in their India manufacturing plant. This unexpected dizziness causing me to stumble is just not ok with me. I never encountered this with Diovan and after a discussion with the pharmacist am switching back. The pharmacist denys knowing of any problems but will report it to the FDA. ,5,1,3
"Had been taking Diovan 80mg 2x a day, sometimes 1x a day, control my blood pressure very well for years with no side effects. Pharmacy changed to generic when it became available because of cost. Took it for a couple of weeks was getting sicker by the day. Blood pressure was higher, lower it a little for a few hours, heart rate stayed low regards of what I did, stayed tired dizzy, weak, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg & arms ached, cough, blurred vision, intermittent vertigo. Decided to switch back to brand name of Diovan, started to feel better in a couple of days. Went to see my doctor, finally. I had tried a number of blood pressure meds before nothing worked for me without a lot of side effects until I tried Diovan.  ",4,1,1

It has kept my headaches at bay, taking 80mg 3x/day, but recently I have begun another sever bout. Upping the dose to 120 3x/day at first decreased the severity of pain from the headaches from an average of 8/10 to a 4/10. Over the last few days, I have been cluster free, just from upping the dose for a week. I think this drug is amazing.

I have experienced mild constipation which I remedy with yogurt Activia with live cultures, and I eat plenty of fruit.I also have an increase in blurred vision. the last issue is sudden chills. All of these side effects are worth dealing with as long as my BP is controlled.The 20 th of Feb. my dosage needed to be increased to 120 mg x2 a day as my BP was no longer controlled by the 120mg x 1 a day.I expect to not have additional issues arise on 240 mg per day, if it happens my Physician appreciates patient input always, and will adjust or change if it becomes necessary.",5,5,5
"Was taking 240 mg of this.  It worked well in lowering my HBP to 110/79 most of the time.  This was good however, I hated taking this pill.  I was extremely constipated, had headaches, lost of hair in large amounts, instantly felt like I was burning up,  constantly wanted to urinate even it just a few drops and I was VERY RED in the face all the time on this drug and at times I sweat like a hog and felt flushed and faint.  I even had my cardio doctor work with me and had him break my pill down in to 80 mgs three times a day.  Couldn't get this right but this was to counteract the VERY RED face, I mean I thought I would pop I was so red and people would stare at me.  Finally got off of this drug and am happy to say I am not having any of these effects any longer.  However, I did have diabetes II and was able to get over it while I was on this drug.  However, I didn't have it long or very bad I thought because I changed my eating habits and stopped sugars and starches and had my A1C back in normal range and has been ever since.  So now I don't know if it was a side effect of a drug I hated that had lots of side effects on me or my better eating habits.  I have to say at times this Verapamil was so good at lowering my high blood pressure that at times it dropped me very fast to 110/60.  ",5,3,5

"I have been dealing with anxiety the past year with neck pain mgmt. proceedures.  Went to ER one night with anxiety attack which lead to Tachycardia.  Had the whole cardiac workup, heart is fine.  Was put on Metoprolol which worked but wanted to try other meds. for BP and heart rate due to wanting to get allergy shots (which you can not due on BetaBlockers), tried two channel blockers over the course of two weeks, one of which was Verapamil Er 120 at bedtime.  This med brought my blood pressure up and heart rate up, palpitations worse with the first night I took it.  My blood pressure on Losartan and Metoprolol kept it under 130/80, so I am seeing Cardiologist tommorrow to get back on Metoprolol and just deal with my allergies another way.  Hopefully doing this and started a low dose antidepressant will get me felling better again.",3,1,1

I was taking diovan but asked the doctor to switch me to losartan because of cost.  I also take  hydrochlorothiazid, tamsulosin,warfarin, avodart, and simvastatin. About 7 years ago I switched doctors and he took me off of verapamil.  5 days later I had A-fib. Chemical shock did not work. The cardiologist put me back on verapamil.  In 3 days my A_fib was gone.  He then increased my dosage to 240 mg twice a day. Moved to Florida.  New doctor.  Talked doctor into my stop taking warfarin since I had no record of a-fib for 5 years. Changed bp medicaation to one 240 mg of verapamil a day and diovan.  A year later I had a-fig for one day.  I am now back on warfarin.  Talked the doctor in changing diovan to losartan.  Saves me approx $1000 a year.  I do go to the bathroom a lot. I have had radiation treatment for prostate cancerand do have an enlarged prostste.

"I started taking this pill at 120mg for 2 weeks, then up to 180mg for my everyday headaches. I've had some relief for the bad headaches, but not so much with the everyday ones. The only problem is lately I have had cotton-mouth for about 2 weeks.",5,4,3
"I've been on blood pressure medication for over two years now, taking nifedipine 30mg-60mg/ toprol+nifedipine / and finally nifedipine 90mg before being switched over to verapamil 120mg - due to a complaint about migraines, have been feeling pretty miserable these past two years and have to say I had no idea how bad I felt on the other drugs, till I started feeling better on this one.  Had no expectations starting this but within two weeks I could sleep through the night, I felt less anxious and my blood pressure is finally perfect 9 out 10 readings.  I have no idea why one calcium channel blocker worked better than the other or if it's going to last but I hope so.  Unfortunately when I switched my Raynaud's came back a little (which is why they were determined to keep me on Nifedipine) but it has been very minor (also it's summer when it usually goes away) and it's a good trade off to the way I was feeling.  I do occasionally feel a bit light headed, tired and spaced but overall so much better and my tiredness is more a normal tired than that anxious-tired from before.  I don't think any bp medication is without side effects, but it's definitely worth checking out other options.",5,4,3
"after taking this medication for a number of years, it gave me sever constipation. I ended up having to have surgery due to this medication to fix the problems due to the severe constipation.",5,1,5

My 18 year old son has experienced migraines with partial paralysis since he was in the 5th grade. Not until last year when he started taking Verapamil did he have any control over the frequency of his episodes. They have reduced from 3-4 a week to 1 every 4-5 months. It has been a miracle for him. (and me) His only side effect seems to be fatigue.,5,5,4
"I've been taking 40mg twice a day for 3 months. Seems to have worked best in the beginning but am on day 3 of pain now. I feel like I am starting all over again.

I Experience headaches,5,4,5
This drug reduced the number of migraines I had from one a week to one a month and actually I've not had a migrain in a couple months. Also taking the drug for hypertension and it seems to work. Went from ~140/95 to ~120/70. I'm very pleased. The only noticable side effect experienced is consipation and this was on the warning materials.,5,5,4
"I was given for high blood pressure in conjunction with benicar because it also treats ventricular fibrillation. It worked fine except when taking antihistamine or decongestant meds, then it is not enough to slow my heartbeat. Also a little water retension but can be handled with a water pill (ankles). Water pill does not help with enlarged prostate urinary problems though. So don't use unless necessary.  ",5,3,3
This was my third preventative migraine medication. It actually didn't help at all.  I was recently switched to Topamax and so far (two weeks) it appears to be working. ,5,1,1
Sometimes light headed with heart palpations tiredness & sleepy ,3,2,3
"While on verapamil 60mg I lost my sense of taste and to a lesser degree smell. My sinus stopped up, my joints became stiff and painful, I had water retention and weight gain, I was tired all the time and lost my energy. It did not bring down my numbers very much and when my doctor said to try using 120mg, I had an allergic reaction to it, with my face swelling and terrible itching. I have since gone back to the more expensive Atacand. My side affects are leaving and I'm feeling like my old self again.",4,1,1
"Drug used mostly for migraine relief in these reviews.  It may work fine for that condition, but it caused terrible side effects for me--lightheaded, pressure in chest, pain in arm, severe itching and tingling in legs.  It should be taken off the market or patients should receive more detailed warnings of side effects. ",2,1,2
"I have taken Verapamil for 10 years for migraine prevention. It has limited my migraines to 3-4 a year until this year. I've had 9 migraines in 3 months. Don't know if this is an anomoly, or the med is not as effective after all this time. Never had side effects, though, which has been great.",5,4,4
"The best, period.  I suffered chronic cluster headaches for years & tried several steroids & miscellaneous meds - all to no avail.  I've been taking verapamil (huge doses) for almost a decade & its saved my life.  Rarely do I have a cluster (maybe a few a year).  I abort breakthrough clusters when I feel one coming on by inhaling as much O2 as possible for 10-20 mins.",5,5,5

took 240 mg of this drug for 8 months and while it kept my blood pressure at 120/80 my heart rate was mostly 100/120 beets per minute and constipation was a major major problem.

This medication was unsuccessful in lowering my blood pressure.,5,1,1

I have been on migraine medications for 9 years now and spent the last 3 years on Verapomil. It worked well for a while but then we had to raise the dose. That took care of the migraines but caused my heartrate to drop and me to pass out. ,3,3,3

"I have taken 180 mg per day for about 5 years and it has very effectively controlled my BP.  Prior my low number was about 100, now consistently low 70s.  Secondarily, I suffer from migraine / cluster headaches.  These have reduced from 1 or 2 per month to just a few per year.  A great side benefit.  I had 2 incidents of low BP over the years (fainting / light headed) - both related the physical rigors of international travel / dehydration.  This has been a very good med for me.  Strongly recommend consideration for someone with high blood pressure AND migraines.",5,5,5
This has controlled my blood pressure very effectively with no side effects.,5,5,5
"I was prescribed this medication twice. The first time was for severe tachacardyia and the second for migraine prevention. Neither time worked well at all. I have very low blood pressure and both times I was taking verapamil it dropped dangerously low and I lost consciousness, once while driving. I explained to the neurologist who gave it to me the second time that I hadn't reacted well before and she assured me that a lower dosage would be safe, but it was not in my case.",1,1,1

I took it twice, when i first got it and then that night. The next day i was completly out of it, all i did was sleep and even then it was all i could do to turn over. A few days later i was informed by my mother that before his death my father was also on this drug, we didnt attribute his 'zombism' to it until that day. Niether my father or I have/had high blood pressure, so we came to the conclusion that the medican caused a drop in in our BP resulting in the near catatonic state ei:Zombism. ",1,1,1

How long does it take before this drug kicks in? Also, I feel like I'm about to faint at any given time of the day. I'm planning to go to the cardiologist, but I don't want a medicine that'll make me gain weight which is counterproductive to my overall goal - to get my bp down, weight down and exercise more.",4,1,2

I have taken Verapamil SR 120mg once a day for 10 yrs. to slow my heartbeat down and help my heart to relax and pump more efficient. I notice that when I don't take it my chest will hurt. So taking it everyday is very important.  ,5,5,5

this drug is great my heart rate has reduced alot nd I feel so much better.,5,5,5
I found you can not take vitamin D in any form with this. It has caused a hesitant conditon in my pulse rate. The pulse beats alright for some beats then stops a second and starts again.

"The Doc prescribed Verapamil after 2 weeks of severe cluster headaches, following a 10 day dosage of Prednisone.  The first dosage of Verapamil 120mg did not kick the headaches, so he doubled the dose to 240mg.  The headaches eased to a tolerable state at that dosage until they went away fully after about a month.  The doc then kept me on Verapamil indefinitely for the headaches and high blood pressure. Be prepared to wake up 3 or 4 times a night to urinate while on this medication. I've also experienced the dizziness and tiredness at times, but not every day like with the urinating.  So far I am impressed with Verapamil.",5,4,4
"Have been taking for 3 weeks now.  Since taking 40mg a day for background headaches and migraine prevention, I have noticed a remarkable improvement in how many daily headaches - maybe 1 a week vs. 1-2 a day.  My gums are very sensitive, no bleeding, but feel tingly often.  Other than that, this has made my life so much better.  ",5,4,4

Have tried several treatments for prevention - couldn't tolerate Topamax, and propranalol didn't do anything but make me dizzy.  Rescue meds like Imitrex and Zomig have helped a little, but my best rescue combo is Relpax and Excedrin with ice packs front and back. ",5,5,4

Blood pressure fell considerably within 12 hours,1,1,1
I have a very slow heart beat and so this was the only drug that worked on my HBP without slowing my heart down to where I couldn't even walk.  So I have recently recommended it to a friend that was having trouble with her medication.  But I am glad that I read these reviews so I can warn her if she starts having any of the side effects I read about here.  ,5,5,5
"My headache I get from this stuff is constant and pretty severe. It is difficult for me to concentrate on anything. The dry cough is also annoying. It has lowered my blodd pressure, but not significantly only about 10 points. I don't care how well it works, it is debilitating and keeping me from living my life. ZESTRIL SUCKS.",4,1,4
I don't like taking medicine but finding out I had to lower my blood pressure I was happy to not have much of a side effect taking this one.Highly recommended my blood pressure is normal again nad its been a week when I started taking the medicine.,5,5,5
"Best drug in the world.  From end stage total heart failure caused by malignant hypertension BP 240/160 to perfect control and good health 11 years later.  The cough goes away in a month.  Stick w. it, it mixes well w. all other drugs and you can still drink heavily once a week w/out problems.  If you get postural hypotension and dizzy spells taking this w. other drugs quit the other drugs first.",5,5,5
"Gave me headaches,got cough and cold symtems.Eyes turn red.",3,1,3
I been geting a dry chough from this drug.,5,1,5
The medication was successful within a matter of days in bringing my blood pressure down to even slightly below normal range (100-120 for upper number and 60-80 for lower number).  However it has caused a persistant dry cough that is making me crazy and seriously disrupting my sleep.  My doctor changed me to another medication 2 days ago and I just found out it is going to take 4-6 weeks to get rid of the cough! So watch out for that.  My doctor didn't mention it as a side effect so I had no idea what was causing it.,1,1,4
"If you notice any joint pain or the beginnings of a rash once you begin this medication, discontinue and call your doctor immediately.  Allergic reactions are rare but severe.  When they say giant hives, they mean giant!",1,1,1
