"I have been taking Acarbose only for a few weeks. But at this point it has lower my blood sugar (BS) significantly. Pre-Acarbose, I was getting BS ranging from 130 to 200. Now I am ranging from 90 to 120 - as measured before each meal. I take 100mg just before eating, 3 times a day (max recommended dose). The only side effect is significant gas - more noise than oder. I am trying to deal with this because the positive BS effect is great. I also take Glipicide,and Tradjenta; but those alone have had very little positive effect. I well report back after a few months of continued use.  ",5,4,4
"Really bad side effects... leg cramps, nauseau, ice headache, swelling in back of eye.  Not sure I can last weeks on this.  When I don't take it no side effects... 1 pill causes such nasty effects feel like chemotherapy toxin in your system",1,1,5
"I have been taking this for almost 2 years, and for the first time in 14 years my A1c is below 7.  I have very little gas.  But it blocks the absorption of calcium, and causes unbearable muscle cramps the last few months.  If I skip  day, my cramps go away almost completely.  It could be a reaction to Levaquin too, so I will try it again in a couple of weeks.  Levequin caused severe tendonitis.  I also take 3,000 mg of calcium and 10,000 units of vitamin D3. I used to have severe cramps for years before starting Acarbose, then felt better on it, then started the calcium and felt better for a year.  It is hard to get this all straightened our.  Hope to start on active vitaminD3, Calcitriol to see if I can absorb calcium better.",5,2,5
"after a uti i was given insulin to control my blood sugar,after treatment of uti to return back to oral hypoglycemics for me was difficult.Acarbose made it easy and now i am having a HbA1c of 6-6.5.",4,5,5
I think it makes my mouth extremely dry at night.,3,1,1
The gas and possibly weight gain Acarbose causes are my only negatives.  I am happy to trade gas for lack of constipation and help with hypoglycemia.,5,5,5
Gas gas gas   Cramps spasms and chronic diarrhea  Feel so frustrated.  Swapping one evil for another ,1,2,4
I like many have bad gas and some abdominal pain. I find it lowers my sugar a lot. I take less insulin now. It has also caused some weight loss which I need the most.,5,4,4
I don't have to worry that my sugar level will take a dive after I eat anymore.  My glucose used to go from 186 after meal and drop to 54 within 1-1.5 hrs. later.,5,5,5
Given acarbose for hypoglycemia.  A lot of gas produced.  Taking 25-50 mg per meal.  Does not keep blood sugar from falling very well.,4,3,3
I have gas and stomach cramps.,2,3,3
"I have not used this drug.  Just looking it up.  Published this week in Dr. Gott's column in local newspaper, patient reports using it for fatigue.  (no mention of diabetes)  I do not have diabetes, but do have post polio fatigue.",3,3,3
I could power a small city with the gas I produce.  Gas-X doesn't make a dent in the gas production.  I stopped taking it days before a significant event and the gas production went away.  I have discontinued taking Acarbose until I see my endocrinologist next month.  I need an alternative to Acarbose.  I discontinued Actos because of the fluid retention.  At least fluid retention does not produce gas.,5,1,3
Every time i take it I get acid indigestion!!!!!,3,1,1
"?After having too many side effects with Metformin and severe reaction with Pioglitazone, I was prescribed Acarbose ( all generic names). Beside some gas problem, I tolerated this better then others. But my blood glucose level was not significantly reduced? Fasting Glucose is still 110 mg/dL , though I have reduced my total caloric intake and very careful with carbohydrates intake. I'm borderline Diabetic and a retired pharmacist I will continue for few weeks before I discuss with my physician and at present taking 300 mg per day in three divided doses. This is the max dose recommended.",3,3,3
"The medication has lowered my blood sugar levels but at the same time i am having bad side effects, mainly abdominal. Flagulance and gastritus. Constipation and diareah.",5,3,5
"my blood sugar has droped but the side affect of gas has not been fun, over all I hope it works.",5,5,5

"It helps me after I eat like it suppose to do. It does not raise my blood sugar, but keeps it down. I love it",5,5,5
"I had been taking this drug for more than 5 years. Last year Januvia was added, because the Actosplus Met was insufficient to adequately lower my blood sugar. For the entire time, I have been unable to lose weight, although my daily calorie consumption is about 1000. I've had extreme fatigue, aches and pains, urinary urgency, carb cravings, and diarrhea. 2 weeks ago I reported to my doctor that my FBG was over 250. He replaced the Januvia with Farxiga. He also sent me to get a cardiac CT scan due to my family history. Since the dye used in the test, combined with metformin can cause lactic acidosis, I couldn't take my Actosplus Met for 2 days. By the second day, I felt great. My FBG was under 170 using just the Farxiga. My aches and pains went away, and the weight just started dropping off. 15 days later, I have lost 11 lbs, my FBG is under 150, I am no longer retaining fluid, and I feel 10 times better. This is only my experience, but there is no way I am ever taking this drug again. I can't believe I've spent 5 years wondering why I couldn't lose weight, no matter how little I ate. A diabetes drug with these side effects should never have been approved by the FDA. Its existence is some kind of cosmic joke on diabetics. I don't know if the drug manufacturer is negligent or inept. A diabetes drug that causes weight gain and aches and pains bad enough to prevent exercise would certainly ensure people have to keep taking it. I have hope that without this drug that I can keep losing weight through diet and exercise and that my numbers will continue to improve. I believe that CT scan may have saved my life, although not in the way it was intended. Your experience may be completely different than mine, but if you are suffering from these side effects, see your doctor. If he or she dismisses your concerns, find another doctor. It's your life, after all.",2,1,3
"This medication increased my appetite, gave me diarrhea and made me feel horrible!",5,1,3
"Horrible! Gained 45 lbs, had trouble with pain with liver, did not control my A1c. Felt miserable constantly, digestive problems with diarrhea all the time.   Went off of the med and lost weight and felt 100% better, doctor insisted I go back on it, now I feel horrible again.",1,1,2
Haven't had any problems with this med so far,5,5,4
"I toke Actosplus met a few years. The side effects were Leg broke, Swelling of the lower leg or ankles,Weight gain (from 140 to 157 lbs), frequently Urinary tract infection and trouble breath. I stopped taking it after my leg broke",3,1,3
following doctors recomendation only,5,4,4
"Did an adequate job of controlling my blood sugar, but started having other symtoms almost immediately. Weight gain, swollen feet and fatigue. Felt much better when I wasn't taking it, lost weight and good energy, but my numbers were high out of control.",4,2,3
"This was a terrible drug and I regret allowing my Dr. to switch me from Metformin (which worked extremely well for me)to ActoplusMet 15/500.   1.)It did NOT control my blood sugar nearly as well as Metformin and my A1c number crept up gradually over the 4 years I was on it, from 5.6 to 6.9. 2.) I gained over 35 pounds in spite of consistent exercise and a pretty darn good dietary regimen. 3.) I began to be suspicious of the early signs of congestive heart failure and possible coronary artery disease which was confirmed by a recent stress EKG and subsequent angiogram.   These problems all took place in spite of good cholesterol numbers in the 135 - 145 range and LDL numbers below 70.  I insisted my doctor take me off Actoplus and went back to plain Metformin about 7 months ago and since then have dropped almost 25 pounds. I'm also seeing huge improvements in my blood glucose readings.  I am absolutely convinced that I got off Actoplus in the nick of time to avoid needing full-blown open heart surgery (at least for now) and am attempting to deal with the CAD with aggressive heart medications, continued exercise and diet ... we'll see over the next year whether or not this works.   Unfotunately there's no way to prove one way or the other that Actoplus is the culprit with resect to the heart issues, but I'm a student of my own body and I'm thoroughly convinced it's the primary cause. The added fact that it did a terrible job controlling my blood sugar, which was the sole reason for taking it in the first place makes it a failed experiment as far as I'm concerned.  It may work for others but it was a disaster for me.  ",5,1,1
"I have been taking 850/15 for about 31/2 months now. It has brought my sugar down, my hemoglobin is now normal at 5.6. I have been walking a couple of miles everyday but for the last 2 3 weeks my joints, especially my hips are hurting a lot. That's effecting my mobility, I can't walk like I used to. I did get stiff before this med but my joints didn't hurt like they hurt now.I need to loose the weight so I can get of this med but I can't exercise. I also get jittery at times.",5,3,5
Has controled symtoms and A1c levels are good. i have encountered an upset stomach and diarrhea at times. I have been using this medication for over 1 year.,4,3,4
I am a senior -77 yrs old- and actoplus plus met 15/850 is the best medicine i have found to control my blood sugar. I am in the gap in my insurane and it cost me 218.00 at walmart and I can't afford it. Is there any way you could help me? I take a lot of medicines and I am having a hard time paying for it. I would appreciate any help you could give me. Thank you.,5,5,5
"Im a newly diagnosed diabetic and started taking Actoplus for 1 month now. This has brought my levels down. Lowest reading 77, highest reading 202. Taking 15/500 2X daily. I do exercise on treadmil at least 30 min a day and eat less than 50 carbs a meal and less than 20 carb a snack, never exceeding 200 carbs a day.  This has worked tremendously and I feel 100 times better. I also take CoQ10, Red yeast rice & Omega3's for my cholesterol as well as vitamin B's.  Had to make a life style change to save it! Hoping my next A1C reading will take me off these.",4,4,4
"I have been taking this medicine 3 times a day for only a week and a half and it is doing really well for my blood sugar numbers, BUT I am so nausuated and tonight I started throwing up. Does anyone else have this problem?",4,1,4
i was on steriods and developed sugar my doctor put me on actoplus my sugar is normal now for 4 month and i am off steriods why should i still have to take this,5,5,5

blood sugar normal range.  anger at times has any experence this side effect?,5,5,4
I have been on this medication over 3 years.  I started taking this medication when my insurer increased the cost of metformin.  I'm on a low dose 15MG/500MG however I can not tolerate the entire pill at once.  I have to split it and take half in the morning when I wake up and half before I go to bed.  I haven't had any other side effects.  My blood suger levels are stable.,5,5,5
"Only 2 day on this med. Used to take Metformin, 100 mg twice a day. This Actoplum Met is making my heart race, giving me anxiety and trouble sleeping. ",5,2,3

THIS MED HAVE WORKED FOR ME AS FAR AS BLOOD SUGAR BUT THE SIDE EFFECT IT HAS IS NOT GOOD.",4,4,4
The actoplus met 850/15 has lowered my level to fairly normal levels (95-110) in the mornings (taking 2x per day)as long as I don't eat a snack too late the night before. I've been reading all the reviews with diarrhea issue but I haven't had any of that. The only minor complaint would be the size of the pill and some dry coughing occurs -but could be contributed by the Lisinopril I'm taking also. No weight gain but I'm trying.,4,5,5
"my dr. took me off glyburide and put me on actoplus becaude my numbers dropped considerably. Have taken it for 6 weeks, all my joints ache,my hips hurt i'm jittery all the time,have irregular heartbeat, my stomach is huge, but I haven't gained any weight. HATE IT!!!!",4,1,2
"Started w/Metformin.  That gave me severe diahrea.  This started the same, but has stopped.  Been on this drug about 6 wks and have started having irriablity and feeling jittery.  That is new.",5,5,5
"Cooler hands, slow bowl movement, and some hip aches.  Overall keeps blood sugar in check unless I eat wrong.",4,3,4
it has worked so much better than metformen,5,5,5
I am on my third day taking one pill per day and it causes severe diaherra several hours after taking......will try it a few more days and see how it goes but not very happy with it as it is now,1,1,3
"I seem to have problems with sudden drops in levels. Once I hit the ""normal"" range of 90 - 123, I need to sleep for at least 15 minutes. And my back hurts, just like if I have drank too much sweet tea. This morning I forgot to take the meds, and when I checked my sugar at 12:30 it was 306. I have concerns about it being therapeutic after three weeks and my sugar still running 306 after the normal(for the past couple of weeks) being around 170. I also have experienced sick to my stomach feeling late at night, to the point that I have to take something for the sickness.",4,1,3
but I gain wt,5,5,5
I am taking this med for type 1 diabetes and have been on it for about 3 months. In the first 6 weeks my A1C level went from 12.5 to 9.2. I do have stomach pain and loss of appetite but if I take with food it is not so bad. I have lost about 10-15 lbs. I don't eat as much food due to nausea and the sweets have been cut back alot. I also have diarrhea most days and usually its about 1 hour or less after eating. Overall if it is helping with my sugar than I don't want to change it. Before the med sugars were in 400's now they are in the normal range.,4,3,4
"My doctor changed me from Actos to Actoplus Med and it has not worked as well the first month with readings in 200 ranage. I have had some weight gain, always wanting to eat, can't sleep, and some muscle cramps.   ",3,2,3
"I started this med in december 2008, so far I have gained 12 lbs., have experienced extremely swollen feet, achy joints. The worst has been the weight gain. I now understand why, after walking 2 miles a day 4 times a week, i wasn't losing weight. I also have noticed that I have been having alot of sleepness nights and I also feel that my stomach keeps getting bigger. ",1,1,3
The actos 850/15 has lowered my level but I've experienced extreme diarrhea. I tried taking the meds once a day vs 2xs and my numbers are great and diarrhea has calmed down. ,4,3,4
I have been taking this medicine more than a month now. I have noticed my bloor sugar come back to normal. I havn't noticed any side effects so far. I am pretty happy with the results.,4,4,4
"Starting blood sugar levels were high 300's to low 400's.  Have been on this med since around New Year's, only complaint is hands and feet stay cold more often than before.  Blood sugar readings are now in the mid to high 100's with an occasional low 200 reading.  I was on Actos before for PCOD, so already familiar with that part of the med.",5,4,4
very good meds,5,5,5

I hurt all the time & feel 20 yrs older.I thought I was getting old. after reading the same side effects here. I'm switching to something different.  plus side..... Keeps my blood sugar level well under control. ",2,2,5
"I've been pleased with Actoplus Met overall; my A1C levels have improved greatly, I haven't noticed any deleterious side effects, and with the better glucose control, my appetite has decreased and I've lost around 30 lbs. My Satisfaction rating would be 5, except that the drug is so expensive and there is no generic formulation available yet.",5,3,4
It has served me well but I would like to find its generic counterpart.,5,5,4
it keeps my blood sugar pretty much level,5,4,4
"Recently changed from Metformin ER (500x2 twice a day) after elevated A1C levels.  Blood sugar level with Actoplus Met are better, but I am extremely fatigued and my eyes have actually turned yellow.  Dr. says his books show no mention of yellowing eyes being a side-effect.  Med works well, but I want my white-eyes back.",5,2,3
"Been taking for 6months, weight gain, diareah,cold hands & feet lots of stomach problems, I am going off it.",4,1,3
"since I have been taking this medicatation my sugar level is much improved but I have cold hands & feet,I have gained more than 25 pounds, My overall health feelings are very irratable, nausia, shortness of breath, I feel worse in my overall daily health than before I started taking this medication almost a year ago. I also have severe diahareea to not having a bowl movement in almost a week and my Dr. says this is normal. I asked him to change this medication several time but he keeps on insisting that my sympthoms are not from the medicatation. I have another appointment with my Dr in two weeks, if he does not change my medicatation at that time I am going to see another Dr. for another opinion.",2,1,2

I drink a few beers occasionally on weekends and holidays and haven't noticied any problems yet.,4,4,4
I am concerned if this medcine causes weight gain and/or insomnia,4,3,4
"I was recently diagnosed with type 2 and have been taking Actoplus Met (15/850) twice daily for 1 1/2 months. When I was first diagnosed, my glucose levels were over 500. My levels seem to be a little too low now(lowest 52 - highest 101)... And this is while I am eating pretty much anything I want (minus high sugar foods - soda, candies, Koolaid...). I asked my doctor if this was normal and he told me he has me on this medication so I can gain more weight. My dietitian said I might be type 1...but I thought type 1 could only take insulin shots. Actoplus Met seems to work fine on my glucose levels...I think I just need a lower dosage.",3,3,3
"I NOW HAVE COLD HANDS AND FEET ALSO MINOR HEADACHES,OTHER THEN THAT IT WORKS WELL LOWERING MY BLOOD SUGARS",5,4,4
I have dizzy spells after taking twice a day-I now only take it in the morning after Bfast. I took it by itself-I became extremely dizzy- It has help my glucose levels but I am concerned about recent medical tests and related heart problems associated with this treatment.,4,4,4
"have had severe stomach aches and weight gain, have even stopped taking meds for a week to see if symptoms subsided. Will ask Dr. to switch to something else",5,3,4
"Medication works, but I wonder if the reactions are worth it? 60 lb weight gain. cold hands and feet.",4,2,4

"I have had muscle and joint aching since I started this med, sometimes pretty bad. Has anyone else had this problem?",5,1,1
This med has caused stomach problems for me.  I thought I would get some ease from it. not yet. will see doctor again.,4,3,2
Since I started using this drug one month ago I have suffered severe diarhea.  I switched from AvandaMet due to the Avandia warnings.  I am going to ask my Doctor to be switched to something else.,5,1,3
This medicine caused diarrea so I had to change it to actos only not the combo,5,1,1
does any one else get very sick after taking this i mean stomach hurts bad and somestimes throw up?,5,3,4
2 pills per day lowered my A1c test from 12.8 to 5.8!,5,5,5
 has kept my glucose at a great leval,4,4,4
Too expensive!,4,4,4
I have been on this medication for about three weeks and my blood sugars are under control. I was on byetta and that was two injections a day and this is just one and i am having better control. No side effects so far.,5,5,5
No noticeable difference to blood sugar levels,1,1,1
My A1c has dropped from 7.2 to 6.2 in the past 3 month period with no adverse side effects.,5,5,5
"Have only been on this for 2.5 weeks and my blood sugars are regularly in the normal range.  Have gotten my fasting blood glucose to 140 which is good as this has always been high, even when I had control with just diet and metformin.  I take 1mg before breakfast and 2mg before dinner.  Have had a couple of lows because I didn't eat enough carbs or ate a very small dinner.  Otherwise, no problems and love seeing my readings in the normal range.  You have to start slow on this med.  I read a review where someone said they took a 4mg pill right off the bat!  Wow!  My doctor had a plan for me to follow to start with just 1mg before breakfast and 1mg before dinner.  I slowly increase until my fasting blood glucose readings get below 130.  At my current dosage, I am already close to that.  I can't imagine taking 4mg at once!",5,5,5
 I was on Metformin for many years and eventually it was becoming ineffective and I was suffering from severe nausea and diarrhea almost constantly. Switched to a Glemiperide and blood sugar is normal and no abdominal complications. At least for me this is almost a miracle drug.,5,5,5
Been using this medication for awhile. Can't seem to remember much on this drug. At first it was working ok but had to adjust from only Crestor 10mg to both Crestor and Amaryl 1mg. Got some blurred vision and A1C rose full 1.5 PT in 3 months. Changed to Pravachol 20mg b/c of ObamaNOcare. What a crock! Still having issues of blurred vision and A1C issues even with exercise and eating right. Tired most of the time and hard to rise and shine when I was a morning person prior to all the meds. Added MetFormin 1000mg twice/day - What CR?P. What next?? Feel like a hamster in a cage. My guess is any drug is not good! Read the label. Terrible drug that works at first until your body gets use to it or the drug reps are giving bad drugs to the Pharmacy - hope not?? Looking at switching to ALL NATURAL stuff.,3,2,2
"Started taking the medication and my numbers dropped in half. However less than 6 months on the medication along with trying to eat right and exercise. I now am right back at the higher numbers. The side effects are wrecking havoc for me.   I now have numbness along most of my right side. Hand, arm leg and some feet. Huge pain across shoulders as well. Did not injure self at all. But never had issue till took medication.   I had to change from night to morning because the pill dipped me too low in the mornings. Now it does nothing for system.   Use to be 85 in afternoon when got home after taking in the morning. Now I see 180 plus waking up. And recently after numbness set in I am now back in the 200 range.   Would not call this pill a success. Also would not recommend for anyone who has Seizure meds to take. This med has put me in many uneasy feelings. Not had any on floor events, but this med does not help. I have had almost every ""severe"" side effect from this medication. All on just 2 MG of medication once a day.  Sad I took this because it seems all diabetes meds only work for a short time and then are no longer useful to my system. Yeah for all of you who can take the cheap medication. Also I have gained 15 pounds in just 3 months time. Not looking forward to seeing how much more I gained in this past 3 months.  I also take this along with 1K metformin as well. I have tried so many different medications and had bad side effects that I am not sure where to go from here. May just need to look into more natural ways of controlling health.   Best of luck to the rest of you,   ",3,2,3
This has NOT worked for me.  My sugars are still in the 200's.  The side effects are I get really sleepy within an hour of taking it and try to remember to take during a meal.  I am taking 2 mg twice a day along with another med. Hope to get this changed next week.,1,1,1
my experience is satisfactory ,4,4,4
I AM TAKING THIS PILL FOR LAST TEN DAYS AND THE DOSE IS EMARYL 2MG HALF IN THE MORNING AND HALF IN THE NIGHT.HOW EVER MY BLOOD LEVELS CAME TO NORMAL BUT IT IS CAUSING 1. LOW SUGARS 2.INCREASED HEART BEAT 3.NERVES SHAKE 4.SWEATING. INSPITE OF THIS MY DOCTOR ADVISED ME TO CONTINUE THE PILL.,4,2,4
"Drs. started me out with too high a dose and had many low sugars. I am now just taking 1 mg in AM and 1 mg with dinner. Completely changed my diet and lost 7 pounds. Still tired, but doing better. Numbers dropped from 340 to 122 average in 2 weeks. Drs. put me on metformin, had a bad trip from that - never again taking that stuff.",5,4,5
"This medication has controlled my sugar, however, one of the doctors Ihave recently seen suggests that Ishould not continue the medication and switch to insulin,I am not happy about this. He is stating that this 2mg Glimepiride causes damage to the pancreatic cells. What is your opinion?",4,4,4
I started this morning with 1mg and two hours later my sugar went from 164 to 167.  Can anyone say how long it takes to start working? Thanks,5,2,1
suger under control but causes erection problems,3,2,4
"I tried many differant medicines, including insulin to treat my diebetes, as well as Dieting & Exercise, nothing brought my blood sugar down untill I was prescribed this medicine. It is working VERY well for me and I have had NO side effects, & I am someone who is sensitive to medications. If your blood sugar is elevated, and diet & exercise are not bringing it down, I highly recommend this medicine. ",5,5,5
it has caused problems of cramps &shivering  along with loss of energy.,5,3,5
"It worked at first, if I exercised after taking it. Now, there is no difference no matter how much physical exertion my day contains. ",5,2,2
Just started using it,1,1,1
When my dose was increased from 2mg to 4 mg i had a severe allergic reaction! Full body hives swollen eye lids and lips.. doctors did not suspect amarly since i had been on it for one year with no problems.  Hives last 3 1/2 months.  When I finally stopped taking the Amarly on my own the hives were total gone within 76 hours.  Terrible experience!,5,1,4
when i take it in the morning 2hrs later my blood sugar drops very low and i get dizzy and need to lay down. i eat something and the dizzy goes away,3,2,2
"always feel tired or drained, gained weight, have sudden spells of low sugar. just don't feel like i have any energy.",3,1,1
i have been taking this for about three months and it has helped me to regulate my sugar.,5,5,4
When I was diagnosed they started me out on Metformin & Byetta.  Over time the Byetta made me so nauseous I asked to switch; they changed me to Actos and I gained 30 lbs. in 3 months.  Then I learned that can be common in some patients.  On Amaryl/Glimepiride for about 6 months & I began to lose the Actos fat right away.  Got injured in a horse accident & while in hospital they increased my Amaryl dose from 3 to 4 mg. in the AM.  Oddly once I got home my fasting blood sugar in the AM was higher than it was before they upped the dosage.  Now that I'm feeling stronger & getting more exercise it is really working for me again & steady weight loss is continuing.  So it surprised me to see so many comments about it causing weight GAIN.  I DO have occasional symptoms of LOW blood sugar on Amaryl which seems weird because my problem has be hyPERglycemia.  But symptoms are not so severe as to cause distress/concern - just have a little sugar if it gets too low.  I've had readings around 70 on occasion and that never happened on Byetta or Actos.  ,4,4,5

I can see why you have weight gain.  You have to eat all the time. My sugars were 200+, but now they are around 130.  So far, I have not gained anything, but I am walking around 2.5 miles a day.  Hopefully with a schedule and walking this pill will be what works!  ",5,3,5
Amaryl works for me..(Along with 1000 milograms of glucophage...) My numbers are usually 110 to 120 in the a.m. 100 in the p.m.. My main gripe is I've gained 10 pounds!!! (I'm 240 pounds right now!) If anyone could recommend another medication (help!!) Rod,3,3,3

I was first put on Metformin and had severe colitus from it on the 4th day. Dr. put me on Amaryl 3 days later and it has worked great for me. my sugars had been running 400+ for 6 months. I had taken Micronaise first and it dropped sugar to 40 and had a hard time bringing it back up. I have not had any side affects since being on it for 2 weeks now. sugars have dropped to 120in the am and 159 in the eve. I am pleased so far. waiting to go for A1c monday afternoon. Last one was 9.2 hoping it has dropped alot. I was the last to get it in my family and I am the last one living. My father and siblings all died from diabetes. I just lost my last brother last week from it.So far this is the only thing I have to take. Watching my diet and walking every day.lost 30 lbs in the last 2 months from sugars being high. I feel gr8 for the first time in a year. Bonnie,5,5,5

"Started on 2 mg / day about 2 to 3 weeks ago and had to adjust down to 1 mg due to MANY hypo's. a1c is down from 8.2 to 6.6 over the last two months since starting in late December originally on glipizide for glucose control. Have discovered that once taken in the morning WITH food as instructed, pancreas goes into 'make insulin like crazy and pump into system irregardless mode' of constant carb intake (or not). Seems I BETTER NOT slowdown on carbs AT ALL (as opposed to trying to LOWER carbs..I HAVE TO keep them coming in or i'll end up with a hypo)! This means constant glucose test test test much more than doc prescribed of 4 times a day into upwards of 6 and that taxes the testing supplies wayyyyyyyy too much. Although having 'better' results because of knowing what to expect with glimeperide as opposed to glipizide XL which hits like a nuke but waits and waits until it hits, I would love suggestions and help finding a glucose control med that doesn't have to be monitored THIS MUCH so I don't go hypo so easily.  I thought the idea is to REDUCE carb and sugar intake NOT have to drink sugary juices and the like throughout the day and hit the glucose tablets twice to three times a day when the meter drops near or just below 70 almost on a regular basis seems around mid afternoon to early eve depleting the testing supplies wayyy too rapidly to 'keep up' with the med's over-effectiveness (even at my 1 mg level) throughout the day.  The warnings on side effects are dead-on especially on the beta-blocker masking some of the hypo's oncoming symptoms since I am also on two high-blood meds which are working just fine. All of these lows have initiated GAD which I have to watch for onset when a hypo hits now and have had to be placed on ativan for that!  This 'eat eat eat' and then juice juice juice WITH test test test is REDICULOUS.  Help would be greatly appreciated opinion-wise.  Thanx VERY Much !",1,1,5

My endocrinologist reduced the dosage to 1mg or 1/2 tablet in the morning. I still have episodes of low blood sugar in the early afternoon.(50-70) I usually can feel the low sugar coming on. I then have to eat to get my sugar up, which can cause weight gain or the inability to lose weight. I have not gained any weight although I am unable to lose weight due to the hypoglocemic episodes and the need to eat to raise my sugar.

My breasts became extremely soar & tender to the touch.  Removing my bra at the end of the day was torturous as the sensitivity to my areola & nipples felt like they were raw & bruised, however looked completely normal.  My breasts remained engorged & tender.  And I experienced my first mensus in 4 years.  Light, & lasted only 2 days. My doctor raised the dosage to 5mg.  My levels dropped to (35).  My next period came 23 days later.  The ovulation stage was similar except the mucus discharge was even heavier! Upon the arrival of my 2nd period the cramping was painful, the flow was heavy & my breasts were extremely dense, fibrous, heavy & soar.  Unbearably so.  The period lasted a week.  Only one week later did I start experiencing the ovulation, discharge & painful lumpy breasts again.  This brings us to today.

We ran several tests and found I had a mildly elevated prolactin level (mid 40s or so?).  It was suggested I do an MRI to determine the size of the prolactinoma.  When the MRI came back with no sign of a prolactinoma, I decided to try the bromocriptine anyway.  Three weeks after taking half a pill twice a day, I got my period.  Must admit the Bromocriptine made me extremely drousy.  Additionally, I woke up with occasional headaches and dry mouth.  Staying hydrated definately helps.  I always sleep with a bottle of water on the nightstand.    ",3,5,5
"I started missing periods without any explanation. Several tests were done, but nothing could be found. Finally, one doctor got a hunch and checked my prolactin level. It was 110. MRI confirmed a macro pituitary adenoma. Original dimensions were 2.4cm x 2.2cm x 1.8cm. There was talk of surgery many times. We tried another drug, Dostinex, but the side effects were too much. My doctor then put me on Bromocriptine 2.5mg. My prolactin level dropped immediately. Six months after starting it, my prolactin level was at 7.8. A year into treatment, it was 6.4. The tumor took a little more time to shrink. Two years and two months after being diagnosed, an MRI showed the tumor as being less than a 1/2 cm in diameter and dying. This drug was very effective. It kept me from having to have a surgery. I AM VERY HAPPY. I do still have to take it to keep my prolactin level down, but it is a smaller dose now. ",5,5,5

I have had o stop & restart med several times, and the longer i take it, a new set of side effects arise. I wondered, has anyone else suffered from complete blockage of sinus. I take my rx @ nite , but wake up after only a couple hours of sleep gasping for air. My nose becomes completely stopped up, and I'm so tired I have to concentrate to breathe through my mouth( which leads to nasty sore throat). I take a 2nd rx to help with the fatigue, but am really at my wits end with these side effects of parodel. Dostinex gave my migraines so no luck there. Does anyone have similar occurances & what can I do about them?",3,3,3
"my dr has me take this med vaginally and it seems to work i have to take this med every time I try to get preg, along with other fertility meds I have endometriosis. but by not taking it orally it does help with the nausea still experiance all the other symptoms really bad! :(",4,3,4
I was dignosed with high prolactin level march 2009. I started caberolgine. Horrible side effects but levels went down. I was changed to bromocriptine 2.5 once a day and over the six months incresed to 10 mg twice a day. After nine months I started my first monthly period in over a year! Overall I am happy with Bromocriptine but it took a while to kick in. I am looking forward to getting preganet!,4,5,5
"My prolactin level was 7 times higher than normal. I had a pituitary tumor, that was removed in 1995. After surgery period returned for about a year, then stopped. I was put on bromo it helped then stopped, then we went to dostinex and it worked then stopped.  I was taken off all meds for 5 years and had no periods.Upon returning to endincronology clinic i was checked,My prolactin level was 7 times higher than normal. I started taking bromocriptine in January 2009,and had a period after five years to come back on by mid February.",5,5,5
"I have not had a period since July 2007. Went to my obgyn said nothing was wrong,so I decided to see my pcp in March 2009. Did some lab and found out my prolactin level was 130. MRI confirmed piturity tumor. Started Caberolgine, trebbile side effects! Then I was rx Bromocriptine 7.5mg twice a day. I have been taking Bromocriptine since June 09. In June my level was 98. I just got some lab done and its down to 85. It is still high and my dr. encourages me to comtinue to take it. It could take a year for it to take full efficative. This med has caused me to have mild nausea, vomiting, headache, and weight loss. For me the medicine is working slowly but hopefully in three months it will go down a little bit more. I am eagered to have children. ",4,2,3
"I was on this medication for over 10 years, I got pregnant because of this drug.  Thank goodness for it.  I had no ill effects from it.  I did go off of it after I had a hysterctomy.",5,4,5
"I went off Birthcontrol in March. Did not have a period for 2 months. Finally in May called the gyno and had some bloodwork done. FOund out that i had a prolactin level of 120. I had an MRI done and found out that i had a 4.5 mm microademia on my pitutary gland. So they refered me to an endocrinologist. He put me on 5 mg a day. One month later my levels dropped from 124 to a 19. That first month on the drug i was moodier than ever. All my emotions were magnified. Bloating, didn't feel good. I usually took it with orange juice that seems to help my stomach. One month after that my levels are still a 19. So my doc increased the dosage to a 7.5 everyday. My moods were going back to normal but i'm getting the symptoms back. Hopefully this higher dosage my body will take less time to adjust to it and my period will restart from it.",5,4,4
"I have been taking Bromocriptine after I was diagnosed with a Prolactin Excreting Tumor a year ago.  It took approx. 7 months and blood work every other month before my Dr. found the correct dose for me, since that time and 4 months later I no longer have any symptoms caused by the tumor.  I have not experienced any side effects from the medication. I am due for a repeat MRI next month to see if the tumors size has decreased. I only wonder what is next because everything I have read about Bromocriptine indicates that is only used temporarily.    ",5,5,5
"I started this medication about a month ago, so far i have not experience any side effect. It is easy to take, as for its effectiveness i will find out next week after my lab result are available.",5,4,2
" i have been taking this medicine for 3 months. before i started this med i would only get my period about 2 times a year. i didnt get my period after 2 months of use, so my dr gave me medroxyprogesterone (a hormone replacement drug) istarted it last month and took it for a week. The following week i got my period. I start another cyce next week. Then if i dont get pregnant my dr is going to start me on Clomid.",4,3,3
"I had very good experience with this medication. I  was having problems with my period and after a visit to a doctor we found out that my prolactin level was too high. I was  taking bromocriptine for about 2,5 months. My period became normal again and now I'm 9 weeks into my first and long-wanted pregnancy.",4,5,5
"I was diagnosed with a macro prolactinoma 2 years ago.My Dr. started me on cabergaline and had to take me off because of a link to heart valvular problems (which I now have).  I started on this drug and experienced horrible side effects (dizziness, nausea,headaches, foggy feelings)  The symptoms subsided in three weeks.  My tumor is shrinking and I am happy.  I am still lactating a bit and my Dr. only wants to up my does if it becomes bothersome. ",2,4,4
"I had absence of period for a year and inability to get pregnant in 2005. I was diagnosed with Micro prolactinomia and put on 2.5 mg.  Within a month my levels were down and I had a period and within a few months I was pregnant. I had my second baby a year ago. My levels as of my last check were around 7. I have had nausea, but I take it right before bed and that helps a ton!!  I'm amazed with the quick and lasting results I've had.",5,4,4
"I haven't had my period for few months. I went to the doctor and my blood test showed high level of prolactin. I was prescribed Bromocriptine. 2,5 for the first week and 5,0 after that. As for side effects, I had them first couple days. I couldn't sleep at night, I felt dizzy. But right now it all disappeared, I've been taking the pills for a little over a month. After the second visit to the doctor I was happy to find out that my prolactin level is back to normal, and I got my period back. So, i'm really satisfied with this medication.",4,4,5
"I was prescribed this medication because I hadn't hat a period in 7 months. They found out that prolactin level was too high that's why I didn't have my period and couldn't get pregnant. I've been taking it for a little bit over a month. I got my period and will be going back to the doctor's in 1,5 weeks, but I'm already satisfied with the medication. Hopefully, prolactin level got to normal and now I'll be able to get pregnant.",4,4,4
I was diagnosed with a prolactin secreting tumor in 2005. I had the surgery to have my tumor removed because it was not responding to the medication Dostinex. I contiuned on Dostinex after the surgery and my prolactin level has stayed slightly elevated. Around 38. My doctor chose to put me on Bromocriptine to see if my level would go down this time. I had my blood drawn today so now is the waiting game to see if the medication worked. If not I know there is a chance of having the Gamma Knife procedure. Has anyone else had this? I know there are very few places that perform it in the US. I will give an update soon of how the Bromocriptine affected my prolactin level. I have not experienced many bad side effects. Mainly nausea when i wake up in the mornings. ,4,3,2
"I've been on this med since 2003, I have experienced all the side effects from this med; stiff joints, headaches, nausea, costipation, no menstrual cycle for as long as 8 months, hi prolactin levels, hi bood pressure, fatigue, low energy, metalic taste in my mouth, dizziness, night sweats, sleepless nights. I always experience at least three or four of the symptoms at the same time and if I miss a dose, I'm like a junky on drugs looking for my next hit! So I guess i'm hooked!!!When I take my missed dose, I feel somewhat better, that's until all the side effects start to kick in.",3,1,2
"I have been taking this med for over 20 years.  I was diagnosed with a micropituitary adenoma when I was 19 and prescribed 2.5 mg - for the first 6 months or so I took this several times a day - after that, just once a day.  I was never told to take this with food - figured that out on my own.  Now it at least shows up on my presciption bottles!  One side effect that I did have was while in college.  At that time I did not have health insurance and the medicine was fairly expensive for a college student, so I tended to not take it as regularly as I should have.  I would have fainting spells, that were never attributed to the meds.  However, since I have been financially stable with health insurance and take the medicine every night before bed, I haven't had any issues for 15 years.",5,4,4
"I've been taking the 2.5 mg dose for 5 weeks now and it no longer affects me physically when I take it at night. The only time I was sick was on the second day. Still no period though (not that I really want it back!) I can't sleep worth anything - not sure if that's due to the medication or not. Nonetheless, it has stopped the physical symptoms I was having.",4,3,4
"Well, 3 months on it now at 5mg.  Still sleeplessness, achyness, fatigue, stuffiness (right after I take the pill), headaches and ocassional dizziness and vomiting. BUT, the good news is I had my first ""normal"" mentrual cycle in 9 months! I guess that means the drug is working. We'll see if it continues to happen. I'll see my doctor next week to check my prolactin levels. My HG hormone is now low too, not sure what that means. I take this drug at night, after a sleeping pill and that seems to help me sleep through some of the symptoms.",3,2,3
"I have been on this drug since 2005. I had the usual side effects (SEVERE headaches, nausea,dry mouth). I am currently taking 7.5mg per day. Sometimes I forget a dose but nothing happens.  My only problem with this drug is I have been trying to get pregnant for over a month and nothing is happening. I have not seen my period since trying to conceive but pregnancy test is negative. I will give an update next month. Other than not getting pregnant, the drug worked well in returning my menstrua cycle.",4,4,4
"OK - It's now been a month on this drug and now taking 5mg per day. Everyday common side effects are still sleeplessnes, dizziness, fatigue, achy body/joints, headaches. No reduction in prolactin levels yet. Still no period. Ocassional side effects are upset stomach or nausea, constipation or diarrhea. = (",2,2,1
"I have been on this medication for over 5 years, due to a prolactinoma.  I currently take 7.5 mg and my prolactin levels have been around 30.  I had the surgery in 1999 and was back on the bromocriptine within 2 months.  I often feel nauseaus throughout the day and dizzy.  I have learned to eat just before bed and take an acid reducer daily to try and limit vomitting.  I have also had problems with my blood pressure dropping low and often feeling cold.  Lately I have been noticing that even taking the 7.5 I have been lactating.  I am not sure if anyone has taken this drug for a while and then had it stop working but I am noticing a lot of the prolactinoma symptoms returning?  I will see my endocrinologist next month and will find out more then.  I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to take this medication and not struggle with the side effects and the best thing I do is take it right after eating and just before I go to bed so that I seem to sleep through the worst of it.  I have become so dizzy I become faint if I take it during the day so I do take all 7.5 mg at one time.",1,3,3
"I've only been on this for 1.5 weeks. I'm on the lowest dose of 2.5 mg for now. Dr. will increase in a couple of weeks I think. LOTS of headaches, some dizziness, sleepless nights, fatigue, not too much nausea at all. I'm also experiencing pain in my joints...anyone else having that?  Too early to tell the effectivness. I'll report back in a couple of weeks.",4,2,1
"My prolatin level was in the range of 79 after using bromocriptine for 3 months its down to <10. I've had no dizzeines, no headaches, no nausa. But I have blurred vision constantly, maybe from tumor. Dr. says this is very unusual for this drug to cause this. Has anyone else experienced this side effect?",5,4,4
made me very sick to my stomach didnt want to do much.,1,1,1
"Awful side effects, wake up in morning and feel groggy and nausea and getting serious headaches or migraines with it.  also constipated and sleepless at night.",3,1,2
this medicine makes me very sick at my stomach i also need to know the side effects an knowone seemes to want to know them    ,3,2,3
After some blood work was performed My prolactin levels were abnormal. After an MRI showed an abnormality in my pituitary I was prescribed bromocriptine. I have been on it for over two years. Levels have been reduced to normal range and the abnormailty(probably/possibly a tumor) has gotten smaller. If i forget to take for a few days I can experience dizziness and nausea again for a couple of days.,4,5,5
"While on this medication, I was very ill.  I began to have fainting spells.  It was determined that this medication was the cause of the fainting spells.  It lowered my prolactin 15 points in a 6 month period.  I began taking a different drug (Dostinex) and am doing so much better. My prolactin levels are almost where they should be.  This is after only 3 months of being on the Dostinex!",1,1,1
"Dry mouth, dizziness and nausea...but side affects disappeared after a few days.",5,5,5
"Nausea & diziness to start with, but this goes away after a few days. I have used this drug for the past ten years (except when I am pregnant/breastfeeding which has been twice)and have had no problems.",4,4,4
"Prepare for dizziness and nausea, crazy dreams, drowsiness and dry mouth.",2,3,3
"After 8 weeks I had to stop using Bydureon. I became nauseous 24/7, with vomiting, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. I lost weight rapidly after becoming ill as I could barely eat. I was even throwing up water. I lost 8.2 lbs the first week, then 4 more lbs the next week. My blood sugar was good, but then I had to worry about low blood sugar since I could barely eat. Iâ??ve had little to no energy. I had marble size knots in my abdomen at the injection sites that havenâ??t gone away. Iâ??m starting my 5th week without Bydureon and am still experiencing diarrhea and fatigue.",2,1,2
Delighted. Have been on this med for apx. 4 months and have lost 33 pounds consistently apx. 7 pounds per month. Hope it continues as I have 40 more to lose. Bld sugar now 110-130 consistently and have reduced lantus from 85/day to 15. Nausea has been a problem but well controlled with anti- nausea med once in morning. Hunger greatly reduced. Over all this has been wonderful.,5,5,5
heart beat increase and palpitations ..... explosive bowel movements .... sore throat ......... lost 15 lbs. .... decreased appetite .... more that I cannot remember at the moment but .... glucose readings way down and consistant ......,3,2,4
I've been using this drug for over a year. The lumps never go away either does the nausea both the day before and after treatment. About one out of eight syringes is not reliable. The injection site seems to leak after treatment. If you are prescribed this plan on an hour for treatment. Slow a half an hour after injection before moving around. I've found that leaving pressure on the injection site slows the leaking as the needle is quite large. ,3,2,3
I just started this medication for about 3 weeks now. I have seen some results. I can eat a bit and my blood does rise like before.  I am beginning to feel normal again. I did experience the lump for a few days but it went away. I do have increased headache not sure if it stems from Bydureon.,5,5,5
it does ooozz a little and i did have a lump at injection site for about 2 weeks but all gone now except last 2 i injected. HAS CUT MY URGE TO EAT BY ABOUT 60% which is a big big plus for me.,5,5,5
"I don't like this medicine.  Does it work, yes.  But this needle hurts, the medicine not only only hurts but leaks out. And these issues are not even the worst thing.  Every shot leaves a hard knot under my skin.  Ask me how long they last...cannot tell you because I still have most of them.  Can only  use on my tummy and because left black and blues on my thighs!  Why am I still using it?  I ask myself this every week, answer is it works.  Mornings blood test are around 125 and lost around a pound a week!",4,3,4
"I've been taking Bydureon for three months now. It does leave a purple spot on the injection site, and I do need to hold cotton over it because of the bleeding.  I notice that it gives me a definite euphoric high for several hours after injection! Not sure what THAT'S all about. And totally knocks out my appetite for a day or so.   But the withdrawal symptoms of BYDUREON are terrible: If I am late even by one day,  a sense of burning,  uncomfortable  prickly heat all over,  extremities especially,   and an awful dysthymia/depression sets in, I feel nearly suicidal and all I want to do is crawl into bed.  I think it is also giving me a foul-tasting belch,  all day long.  Until my next injection.   So this stuff is like a strange type of heroin  for me.  It's outrageously expensive, so I am on a Patient Assistance Program to cover the co-pay.  ",4,4,4
"I've been using Bydureon for 10 weeks and have been loosing about a pound a week, reducing my need for insulin by about 40%, and reducing the peaks in cbs after eating.  It's a clunky big syringe but I only use it once  week.  No problem with lumps; does ooze a bit after injections, but obviously most of the medication is getting in.   It dramatically reduces my appetite allowing me to eat 20% less, not feel deprived, and still feel energetic. In the past with caloric reduction,  my body has always gone into some sort of starvation energy conservation mode where I couldn't do much of anything.  I've fought weight all my life and this is a total game changer for me.  Well worth a bit of inconvenience.  ",5,4,5
"About two years ago my insurance forced a switch from Victoza, which had been effective. I have been pleasantly surprised that the combination of weekly Bydureon along with daily Lantus and metformin have successfully controlled my 10  year Type 2 diabetes. The last A1c was 5.2 and me and the doctor are quite pleased. The whole Bydureon injection apparatus, like most things, takes some practice to skillfully mix and inject the medication each week, but is now routine. I am not sure if I could afford this medication without good insurance, but it has worked for me.",5,5,5
"I attempted to use Bydureon a year ago. I injected seven times. The first time in the belly and the other attempts were in my thighs. I did not like the size or gauge of the needle It left a large hole were the medication would ooze back out. The plungers were terrible. I had to put so much pressure on the plungers that I thought the device was broken. The medication left these large lumps in my body that supposedly would go away a few weeks later, well here I am telling you that the lumps went down after 4 months after each injection. I don't think I had any of the nausea or other side effects but I did not see any beneficial results after taking the medication for seven weeks. The difficulty I had with the plungers and the lumps were enough for me to discontinue the shots and tell my Doctor to put me back on the Lantus, Novolog and Janumet regimen. Last but not least, here I am a year later and when ever I inject my current meds into the sites where I had the Bydureon lumps the area lumps up again. Bad experience for me.",2,1,2
I can not rate the effectiveness of Bydureon but I can say I have had issues with the plunger not completely depressing and I don't like the size of the needle. I have bled significantly from the injection site and I'm not a bleeder.  We will say how effective it is as far as my A1C.,2,2,2
"On my 6th week. The numbers are good last week average was 90. It does leave small knots at the injection sites. Some are going away. I also developed hives which have disappeared. Now I'm suffering from gas and belching after I eat. Taking tums help with that. It's a great drug to control blood sugars after failure with Invokana, Farxiga. I hope the side effects go away.",5,3,5
"I had to go to this med due to my insurance, I tried Truelicity first with  no side effects, but I had reactions to this med, swelling and extreme itching all around the injection site.",1,1,1
Developed pancreatitis after 4 doses. Ongoing pancreatic issues since. Had such high hopes!,3,1,1
Started this along with Invokana-dropped 33 lbs in 3 months.  I have a string of lumps in my tummy at injection sites so I tried using inner thighs-same thing.  Very concerned about extreme weight loss ,2,2,2
"I've been using Bydureon for 5 months after switching from Byetta for insurance reasons.  It's painful to inject, causes significant bleeding from the injection site, and leaves lumps under the skin that last for a couple months.  In addition, I've had problems with two of the pens where the plunger will not move once the needle is inserted.  One was not able to be depressed at all and I had to remove and switch pens.  The second only was able to be depressed halfway, leaving a portion of the medicine in the pen and not in me.  I'm no weakling and the plunger was seriously stuck and could not be moved.",1,2,3
Difficult to prepare for use (mixing). Sugar level has not been under 200 except twice in last 6 weeks. Was on Victoza and worked great but military switched to Bydureon because of Budget so can't get anymore. Lost little weight.  ,3,2,3
"I have been taking this medication for one month and had serious nausea the day after the first dose that lasted all day.  Since then no significant symptoms other than occasional nausea.  I noticed the medication creates a lump under the skin within the fatty tissue after the needle is taken out.  I press the lump gently with an alcohol swap which helps distribute medication until it's gone. I have no lumps. BS is lower, lost 4lbs and will see if AC1 has improved on my next Drs visit at the end of October. ",3,3,3
"When first prescribed this medicine I was very leary after reading the reviews. I am now on week 5. I just checked my blood sugar for the morning and it was 101! These are the best numbers I have had in years! I am very care full when mixing and injecting. I take my time and go exactly by the directions. I have had no problems with the injection site. I have lost 12 pounds! At first I didnt think it was working. It takes a few weeks to kick in. I do some times get an upset stomach but it is worth it. It curbs your appetite a LOT. I do have some indigestion, but you just have to be care full what you eat. So far I am 100% satisfied! I have fought those numbers for years and these are the best I have had in several years.I highly recommend this.",5,5,5
"Only using Bydureon for three weeks. Used Victoza free sample for a month, which gave great results, but insurance refused to pay for perscription so I ended up on Bydureon. First, it is a huge pain in the neck to mix; second, it is a pain to keep refrigerated (I travel); third, it is a pain in the stomach to inject; fourth, the lumps are a pain; and finally, the results don't compare to Victoza. Victoza's market share would surely increase if they become more insurance friendly.",1,1,1
"Having never injected myself in my life, i was reluctant to try Bydureon, but after two months of using it, I find that there was a short learning curve but now I am doing very well with the injections, plus Bydureon is bringing my A1C numbers into a decent range.  Thanks!",5,4,5
Please stay away.  It's cylinder stuck twice.  I had to use new one.  Their customer service is very bad. Took to pharmacy.  Company don't want to replace even.,1,1,3
"I just got my first lab work back yesterday, after being on this drug for several months.  My previous AC1 was 8.6, yesterday it was 6.5,  My previous glucose average was 194, yesterday it was 140.  I take metiformin 500mg tabs twice daily.  I am NOT strict with my diet at all, honestly, I pretty much eat what I like, when I like.  I do NOT eat breakfast 99% of the time, hate it. I am more than happy with my results.",4,5,5
Been taking the injections nearly 3 mos. Lost a few pounds. Never hungry. Maybe a little quesey once in awhile but keeping the BS so low is great! Hope the A1c next month shows how its working.  And insurance is making it affordable.  Where has this been all these years?  I love it!,5,5,5
"After 8 weeks of hoping side effects would dissipate, I had to discintinue use.  The needles hurt and the injection sights would swell andd itch.  I suffered with hot flashes, headaches, explosive diarreah, naussea and an overall feeling of ill-health; this medication was toxic for me and not worth the side effects.",2,1,2
"Only had two injections, nausea is really bad especially after the second shot.  Have a bad taste in my mouth.  Have had cramping and diarrhea.  Also, have no energy.",3,1,3
Love it! No side affects. BS lower and am going to decrease insulin.  Packaging scary but instructions  really easy to follow. I will continue with this medicine.,4,5,5
"Took for 6 weeks. Seemed to lower my glucose levels initially and did lose weight, but was sick 2-3 days after each injection with nausea and twice spent 24 hours being sick and throwing up. The side effects were not worth it. Drug reaction seems very toxic.",1,1,3
"Switched to Bydureon after a decade of metformin and glipizide, and while it's only been 4 weeks, I couldn't be more happy with the results. Because of the appetite-suppression, even when I eat something ""bad"", I fill up so fast, plus I tend to forget to eat altogether, not to mention no more snacking. I've lost 15 lbs in a month, and have yet to ever see a bs reading above 180. The injection process is a bit painful, and sometimes itches for a day or two, but to me it's a really small price to pay.",4,5,5
Had lumps at the injection site and it hurt like hell.  Results were great but it takes fully 6-8 doses to reach it maximum effectiveness.  I'd be using it today if it didn't hurt so bad compared to the nano needles.,1,2,4
"BS is lower, appetite less, lost a few lbs, taken med for 2 mos. Happy with results and will continue taking.",5,5,5
"I took the injection 5 weeks and my numbers stayed the same, after that I got very sick, vomiting and nausea were so bad I thought I had food positing, after 2 weeks, I was still very sick and had to go to the emergency room. I was advised not to take this medication and was told this can stay in my system 5 weeks. it's been 3 weeks and I still feel horrible, I never had bad side effects to any medication in the past. I felt like I was going to die after each attach. I wouldn't take something like this again, especially since it wasn't even effective the first 5 weeks. save your self the extreme pain and don't use it.",1,1,1
"The treatment works great, I haven't had BS above 120 but the injections are extremely painful. I may be injecting in the wrong areas, does anyone else have this issue?",2,4,5
"The system for assembling the syringe, dry medication vial and the liquid is unnecessarily complicated and poorly designed.  The manufacturer need to go back to square 1 and design a delivery system that is easier and more foolproof.  Parts keep sliding out of place and it is frustrating to determine if you have completed thing properly and got the dosage needed.  ",1,1,3
Each injection created a hard bump under the skin.  This drug caused extreme nausea (was on it for 3 months and that did not change). Hot flashes got worse too.,1,1,2
I love the way I feel...but I have lost so much hair I can't ignore it any longer. I am so sad to stop. I had a tiny bit of nausea the first few days...some indigestion and burping the first couple of weeks...then I felt good.,4,4,5
"It causes lumps under the skin and is painful.  The needles are too big and do not puncture skin really easy.  I think I used 3 weeks now, and have 3 lump under the skin that are painful and have a burning sensation.  I am stopping this medication.  I am going to be really upset if this medication causes me any more problems..like having to have the lumps removed or worse.",1,1,1
"frequently have difficulty pressing in the release button. Also, have numerous non-painful nodules at injection sites. The needle is just to thick and causes pain or discomfort, thank goodness its just once a week. ",2,3,4
"The medication is very effective at helping me control my blood sugar, but it is very easy for the needle to clog resulting in non delivery of the med, and at several hundred dollars per dose to replace it is prohibitive.",3,4,5
This medication has been a godsend for me.  It has brought my blood sugars under control for the first time in 8 years.  My A1C has dropped from 9 to 6.5 and then to 5.8 in 6 months!,5,5,5
been taking this drug for a month.   have not had a reading under 250 since I started. didn't eat for day woke up with a reading of 275.  ,2,1,1
I now have two large lumps in my stomach. I may need surgery to correct the problem. I used this drug once. Do not for any reason use this medication. I wished I had checked into the reviews more before I took this medication. It now will cost me several thousand dollars to get this corrected. Steve Hunt [email protected],2,1,1
I've been taking Bydureon for 6 weeks and have been lethargic for 4 weeks. I have no energy to do my regular activities. My stomach is constantly uncomfortable or sick and I have bouts of diarrhea. I'm calling the doctor Monday to stop taking this med. ,4,1,1
"In week 6.  No lumps or itching.  Big loss in appetite.  Have dropped about 6 lbs.  BS dropped form 170 to 110 in the morning.  I do experience hot flashes / sugar rush if I have sweets, or just a regular sized meal.  ",4,4,5
I have taken the injections for 3 months now and still have knots at the injection site. Has anyone else had this problem? I know it's a side effect but how long can I expect the knots? Is it normal for the knots to remain there for months?,1,3,4
"Yes it has reduced my sugar numbers but as others have reported. Hate the constant nausea and the welts that come with this. Cant eat anything substantial Because it causes runs, etc and also abdomen swelling. Will be starting Trulicity to see if that works better.",5,2,5
"worse thing i ever used,I am on humalog and levemir. took this and first injection in belly itched like crazy, swollen up and still have a knot at injction site. i thought maybe it was cause of my stretch marks. So following week injected into thigh.thigh swollen a area the size of my hand.red itchy hard knot, got so bad i had to got to ER wich they could do nothing cause sterod shot would make my sugar sky rocket. I used benedry, itch cream, calamin lotion, cold and hot packs. nothing worked!!! just have to suffer with the pain swelling and itching till its out of my system.BEEN 2 weeks and still itching at main site of injection still have a knot and its bruised. I would rather take 100 insulin injections a day then to ever deal with this again! I called the company and reported this and they said this was the first report ofthis kind. Doctor toldme if I had kept taking this drug  i could have gone into antifalatic shock and might have died. ",1,1,1
Have been taking for 1 month now. One of the most effective medications helping me manage my type 2 diabetis,4,5,5
"Blood sugars went down, but made me sicker than a dog.  Worked great for suppressing appetite. Severe nausea, lumps at injection site, stomach problems all of them so bad I had to get off the medication.  3 months later still have lumps from areas where I injected the medication.  Not sure they will ever go away.  Preparing the medication is a serious pain, the needle is very wide and long, and the medication costs a lot!  I did like how you only need to take it once a week.",2,2,4
Worst diarrhea I have ever had.  Onset occurred about 12 hours after injection and continued for two days.  Also nausea and a foggy feeling mentally.,1,1,2
"I have been taking Bydureon for about a year now and I still get an upset stomach and dizziness. So it does not go away. I do not like the needle at all because it does hurt and leave lumps. I also may have to find something else because my insurance will not cover the cost for the whole year and the price is crazy. Now I have to find something else. I am, losing weight and my appetite has really gone down...also good A1C numbers.",1,3,4
Just took shot #4 A lot of stomach pains and diarrhea this week.  My blood sugars have dropped dramatically so I am trying to stick it out.  ,3,3,5
I was nauseated almost every day.  I was on the shot for 3 weeks.  After the 3rd shot the pains in my stomach were so severe I was bending over in pain.  I was vomiting every other day just at random times.   I still have lumps under my skin where I did the injections.  My doctor told me to stop the shots and still after another week I was still nauseated and vomiting.  I have never felt so ill in my entire life.   ,3,1,3
"Reviewed this early on, now have been taking for 18 months and time to review again.  My A1C dropped from 9.4 and is now 6.3!  The medication is difficult to use; however, this has just come out in pen form.  I will be using this method from now on.  Large, a bit cumbersome, but so much easier than the ""old"" mixing method and all the parts!  Side effects pretty much stopped although I still get heartburn on occasion.  Not as bad as in the beginning.  I keep Nexium handy!  If I could control my eating (I do exercise daily) I'm sure A1C would be better yet, but what an improvement!  It's worth the pain & irritation from the injection...at least for now.  I also take Metformin and a very small amount of Levemir.  ",3,4,5
"Moved to this from Byetta which had slowly stopped controlling my sugars.  Bydureon is controlling admirably.  No particular side effects, using mentholated alcohol to scrub the injection site before and after - no swelling or urticaria.  ",3,5,5
"As far as my A1C goes, I couldn't happier! It has dropped from above 7 to 5.5 in the over 1 year I have been using Bydureon. At first I was not hungry except at meal times which was really great! I soon dropped 70 LB. Then the weight lose stopped. I noticed that my hair was falling out and didn't know why. My daughter did some research and learned it was because of Bydureon. Thankfully it stopped too. It is thicker now but I still have a bald patch under the top of the front of my hair that I can thankfully hide. My hunger has slowly grown back till now I am hungry about every 3 hours instead of every 5 the way I was before I started on the injections. It is very frustrating to say the least. I just hope and pray I don't gain back the weight I have lost. I am still wanting to lose 150 LB more and am not seeing any lose right now.",4,3,4
Blood Sugars are coming down as well as weight. Only thing I am noticing is I keep getting this feeling like a half burp/half gas.  It is not uncomfortable but annoying. Has anyone else experienced this?,3,3,4
"I started Bydureon 7 weeks ago.  I also take Invokana 300 mg in the morning and Metformin ER 1000 mg daily in the evening.  My blood sugars have ranged from 87 - 113 the past 7 weeks. (from a high of 326) I have lost 10 lbs.  Will have A1c drawn next month. I rarely experience nausea, but when I do it is relieved by eating any form of oatmeal. I am a healthcare professional so self-administration of Bydureon is not a problem.",5,5,5
Taken off Victoza due to insurance refusing to pay earlier this year.  Although appetite has decreased I have noticed that I am more uncomfortable in my clothes that use to fit prior to Bydureon.,3,1,2
"After changing Drs. New town andnew Dr. He suggests Bydureon I was not excited due to injection...but now at 5months of using Bydureon...My weight is down feeling good 74 yrs.old,numbers are back down 80's to 110.  I'm one happy girl. My friends ask what am doing that I've have so much engery and so happy go lucky! Thanks to Bydureon and the once weekly injection...it's the freedom of not having to remember the daily meds. Away with ACTOS and all the others. For me it's only one Bydureon...",5,5,5
"Large painful needle, very expensive, but only requires a weekly injection-which is great. ",5,1,3
"Works for me. Lost 20 pounds, HbA1C down, appetite down. Injection is a different than insulin since the consistency is thick, but not a big deal.",4,5,5
"after 4 doses, I am experiencing constant sore throat, cough, a general foggy mental state, a feeling like a low temperature, lethargy, not wanting to do anything but lay in bed, a lot of congestion in my throat.",4,1,4
I started taking bydureon 1/2014 when my insurance stopped covering victoza. I have gained 30 pounds. The mixing is a pain and the needle really hurts. I bleed each time and worry the medication is leaking out. Not happy at all. Asking doctor to authorize change back to victoza.,1,1,3
"Amen to what Kansas Dad said about having to discontinue Victoza due to insurance change! I have been an insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetic for 20 years. I took Victoza for 2+ years and found it very effective for both glucose and appetite control. However, my insurance dropped coverage as of Jan. 2014. After milking the last drop from my Victoza script, I just started on Bydureon this week. No problem with the mix/injection (I did inject IMMEDIATELY after mixing), BUT I quickly found that I needed to DOUBLE my Humalog/Humulin units! Has anyone else had this issue, and does it improve over time? Thanks!",4,2,2
"I take bydureon along with my ivokana and metformin. I have lost about 20lbs. Taking the shot once a week can be painful, but any needle is going to sting. I take it in my stomach. A lump & bruising sometimes happen, but it's worth it. My A1C is down, my weight is down and my health is doing a lot better.",3,4,4
over all the treatment is good except for the bump under the skin and brusing after the injection.,4,4,4
"I've been taking Bydureon for 5 weeks now. I never thought I could give myself injections. The need is small and painless. FBS run between 80 and 100. Injection site itchy with swelling and tenderness for 3 days tops. So, far the experience has been pleasant.  ",5,5,5
"Type 1 diabetic trying to avoid postprandial highs.  Previous A1C 7.6, but usually around 8.3-8.6, with weight gain.  6 weeks after starting injections, the nausea and vomiting and diarrhea began with a vengeance, but only lasted 1 day.  Then horrible constipation for 2 weeks, followed by another bout of diarrhea and vomiting and pain that lasted for 24 hours.  Unfortunately, I can't do my job with these kinds of recurring symptoms.  Never have I had gas pains as bad as with this medicine.  I have lost weight (10 lbs), but it's because I cannot eat most of the time.  I feel full and bloated all the time.  I do not recommend this medicine.",5,2,2
Easiest needle I've ever had. Less noticeable than the blood sticks on my fingers. No soreness afterwards. I chose inside of the middle left thigh. First injection was this week. I am very hopeful. Stopped Januvia. Still taking Metformin 1000DR twice daily. Complete instructions in every injection's package helped a lot.  This is the first time I've ever had to give myself shots.,5,2,3
"Overall I am satisfied with the results from this drug. The needle is large and hard to go into the skin. At first I got lumps after the shots, but I started massaging the area immediately after taking the shot and the lump goes away. The massaging helps the fluid from the shot get into the body instead of staying in a lump. It works. I can't wait until it comes into 'pen' form.",1,4,5
FIRST DOSE LEFT LUMP IN THIGH THAT GETS WARM TO TOUCH AND ITCHES. STILL THERE TREE WEEKS LATER. ALSO DROPPED SUGAR LEVEL - WAS SHAKING/SEVERE THIRST/ TINGLING HANDS. NEVER DID TAKE THIRDV DOSE.,2,1,1
"I'm in my 9th week of injections. After then second injection I figured out how to avoid the pain and swelling. I also take Lantus and novolog. Since the Bydurian I've had to decrease both by over 25%.I've also started dropping the pounds, 10 pounds so far.",4,5,5
Very painful injection. Severe swelling and soreness at injection site.,1,1,1
"I had been taking Victoza for years and was very happy with it and my blood sugar levels were vey good.  My blue Cross insurance said they would no longer cover Victoza as of Jan 2014 and so my dr put me on Bydureon. I am on my 6th shot. My BS levels have gone from 130 to 180 and higher. I am tired, irratable and do not feel as good. The weekly shot is nice, but it takes me 15 mins or longer to get the meds mixed before I can give myself the shot. My doctor tells me I have to wait 6-8 weeks before we will see a difference in my BS. Personally, I am not happy and was pleased with the previous medication I was on. I think its wrong that an insurance company can tell you, sorry, we are not covering that medication because this one better. My doctor was not pleased about having to switch my meds either- if's working and the patient is happy- leave things alone!",2,1,2
"Have been using for over 4 months. At first, I had a lot of loose bowel movements,major decrease of hunger with a little upset tummy. Have lost 20 lbs, major YEA! But now my stomach is settling down and my hunger is returning. Easy to use. Be sure to tap bottle to loosen the drug before mixing.",5,5,5
"I figured out how to avoid the lumps! I didn't get the lump the first time I injected with a nurse, but did the next 6 times until I carefully reread the instructions again. The instructions say that if you wait too long to take the shot after injecting, the needle will get clogged. I didn't think I was waiting too long, but did notice it would be hard to push in sometimes. Now, if I inject ASAP after a quick mixing, I don't have any clogging issues and then I DON'T get the lumps! Yaaay! ..hope this helps",3,3,4
did not help to produce Beta cells as I have hoped!,3,3,3
"My doctor recommended bydureon for me because I was having trouble maintaining my weight with my previous regimen of Actos, Janumet, and Glimeperide. My AiC was 6.8 and my readings were usually always under 150. When I switched to bydureon (along with Metformin and Glimeperide) my readings shot to over 200. I did 6 weeks of injections, but the readings never came down. I also experienced the lumps and itching at the injection sites others have reported.  Just prior to taking what would have been my 7th injection, I developed a serious allergic reaction - lips, throat, chin were swollen, and developed hives all over - arms, legs, back, even the palms of my hands. Needless to say I didn't take the 7th injection. After two days of prednisone, I'm almost back to normal, and I'll be going back to my previous regimen. I guess I'll try something else to lose the weight I need to lose.",3,1,1
"I took bydureon SubQ for 8 weeks. The symptoms of sour stomach, nausea and severe and excessive gas, abdominal pain became progressively worse every week that I used it..it did bring my BS down but had to come off of it due to the severe side effects. Back to the drawing board...3 days a week being laid up in the bed is not worth it to me..back to consult with my Endocrinologist about plan c or d..Ive lost track by now..Good luck to all that are struggling...God Bless..  ",4,1,3
"I've used Bydureon since March 2012. I've also taken Byetta from 2005 - 2010 and Victoza from 2010 - 2012.  Bydureon has the most effective and consistent blood sugar control and the fewest side effects.  Generally, I've had better results from the self-injected diabetes drugs.",4,5,5
I started this medication 5 weeks ago. It did give nausea but took some Zofran and that helped noticed considerable constipation so what I did this last dosage was take some over the counter Colace and it was a lot better-It is a little painful with the injection but I get through it. My blood sugars have gone from around 200 to an average of 150. I love the once a week injection. I do get the little bumps under my skin but have found if I let it get room temp it is not as bad and they do itch some but it is tolerable. I lost about 4lbs so far because it curbs the hungry feeling I had with metformin. Will check back in a couple of weeks on how things are going. ,3,5,5
"I am 61 and have been diabetic for 11 yrs. I am on Insulin and Metformin. I started on bydureon in Sept, because my A1c has always been around 8. This drug has greatly lowered my Blood suger levels, and my last A1c was 7.1. Yes, the large needle hurts and yes I do have nausea, but the outcome is worth it. I have also lost 15 lbs yahoo!  I'm expecting even better A1cs in the future, and an additional few lbs off would be nice. ",4,5,5
"This is an update:  since starting Bydureon at end of April, my A1C went from 9.4 to 7.1 in mid-August.  My docs are so happy!  I still think this is very hard to use, I have a very bad time getting the thick needle into my skin and have pretty much permanent scarring/bumps.  On the positive side, I have decreased Levemir from 27 units 2x day to 16 or 17 2x day.  Still metformin, 2 pills 2x day.  Overall, this med is working for me.  Do I like it?  No, but in more than 5 yrs this is the only med to get A1C down, and down quickly. Morning blood sugars are now 115-135; used to be 170-230. BS much better a couple hours after eating where it never was before. Need to be better about diet, and I will have even better results.   ",3,5,5
"I've been on Bydureon for just over a year now and have had great results.  In addition, I take Metformin.  I watch what I eat and exercise 3 times a week -- and my A1c is down to 5.3.  My primary care doc is thrilled.  I get the bumps -- hematomas -- due to the fact that so much fluid is injected and it takes about 2 weeks for it all to be absorbed.  Occasionally I hit a blood vessel and get a HUGE bruise that usually resolves itself in 2 weeks.  Hate the size of the needle, but it is easier than twice daily injections of Byetta.",3,4,5
"I have been taking 1,000mg of Metformin for 6 years with fair results blood sugar @ 200 -230 so Dr. suggested we try Bydureon . after 2 months 8 injections my blood sugar rose from 250 to 350,  also injections leave hard knots in my stomach which eventually diminish in about 30 days",3,1,1
"It definitely works! My sugar levels have improved dramatically. I started getting some low 80 levels 3 hours after meals, so I had to cut back on my other medication. It is a pain to do the shot, but it gets easier every time, and it is only once a week. My only complaint is the little bumps I have at every injection site. I hope they go away. ",3,3,5
"First week taken the drug, and BS have been running high, due to the study of the drug and taken insulin, gave me great anxiety because I was too scare to take my Lantus or Novolog so my BS remain high for longer periods and that I didnt' like, I also noticed my BP increased the first day I took the drug which probably stem from my anxiety that my BS was up in the 300s and I was too scare to do a correction dose of Insulin. I am not sure I will stay on the drug because it really hasn't proven its safe to take with insulin and I can't take metformin. The drug is new on the market, the weekly dosage is a wonderful concept but at what expense if the makers can't provide a scientific study to know if it's safe to use with insulin. I don't think the medicine was really ready for the market yet but was push on out for the millions it would make and we are the live lab rats.",3,1,1
"F/U review. A1C was 6.4 at end of June. However, no longer nauseous, but have been having stomach problems, feeling like I've been punched in the stomach with every movement again 24hrs after injection and lasting for 48-72 hrs. I have lost 22 pounds since starting the med, and bs numbers have been really good as in last two days 102. But have no real appetite.",5,4,5
"This med is helping in my effort to lower my weight. I feel that it is working for me. I have several illness, and lowering my weight will help keep them under control. ",5,5,5
"Have been on Bydureon since end of April.  Had tried Byetta two yrs ago - didn't work, too complicated w/times, etc.  Bydureon has worked, have not yet had A1C checked, but overall blood sugars have been really good.  Also take Metformin 2x day and am weaning off of Levemir (which is SO easy!).  Only major complaint:  past two weeks I am so nauseous.  Bad feeling in pit of my stomach, like a knot.  Don't vomit, but feel that way.  Also, my IBS is acting up, had been great.  Will take this as long as I can, but am wavering.  I also think it's difficult to inject, needle is very thick due to the liquid.  Not fun!",2,3,4
"I was diagnosed with T2DM in December 2005 after consistent fasting blood sugars of 136  and was placed on Metformin 500mg once a day, then twice a day ,which has kept my blood sugars controlled to date ; have never required insulin, and A1C's run 6 to 6.2. I've been unable to lose an ounce of  weight despite exercise and reduced caloric intake . Started the incretin mimetic Bydureon June 6, 2013 as an adjunct to  Metformin. Pros: lost 11 lbs so far ; no nausea; once a week injections convenient , syringe assemblage somewhat cumbersome but duable. Search engines indicate  a ""pen"" is being developed  for injection, which is great news. Cons: Black Box Warning : possible risk for medullary thyroid cancer, especially if one has a family history of such and pancreatitis because some of the lab rats developed both during the testing phase of the drug ; I have severe itching and redness that encircles the injection site 1.5 inches , which appears about 3 days after injection. My stomach looks like it was hit with paintballs because the healed injection sites have turned light brown . Bydureon is very expensive out of pocket, most insurances do not cover it and  if they do, it's Tier 4 or ""Specialty Drug""  with a hefty co-pay. Heard Victoza works as well, is less expensive, but downside is it requires daily injections instead of once weekly . I read that thyroid scans and calcitonin levels should be monitored while on Bydureon. Not sure if that is correct, but am sure going to ask my doctor about it. I'm eager to see the effect Bydureon has had on my next A1C in Sept 2013.  ",4,4,5
Love the fact that you only take it once a week.,3,4,4
IMHO Bydureon can not be injected effectively. Many times when the packaged injector is inserted into the vail the Bydureon powder in lost from the vail leading to incorrect dosages. The product requires VERY COMPLEX assemblage and the needle used is large an painful. BEWARE,1,1,1
"I have been on this medication since near the end of March 2013. My first Dr appt is the end of June, we'll see what my A1C is then. About 8wks into the medication, I started w/nausea approx 24hrs after injection that lasts 24-72 hrs. I too have the lumps, some itch worse than others. I also get bruising and inflammation around the injection site.",4,3,3
"head aces, gut acts muscles aces over all  sick from day of taking it",1,1,1
"I have been on Bydureon for about 7 months now. My weight hasn't really dropped, but my A1C is now down to 6.5 from 10.8. I too have the bumps under my skin from the injections, but they go away after time. I have never experienced any itching or nausea, and the only side-effect I have had was feeling dizzy when I first started this medication. I take Tradjenta in conjunction with this medication, as the Metformin didn't agree with me. I think this drug is very effective, at least in my case.",3,5,5
I have been on bydureon since September/12. I have lost 27lbs but nothing since and I seem to be holding with that so far. My A1C went from 9 to 7 which was great also and my appetite has gone way down. Metformin made me feel like I was starving all the time. The only thing that bugs me are these hard lumps on my stomach from the injection sites. The Doc told me not to worry about them and I don't but I would like some kind of explaination as to what they are at least. They are as hard as a rock and vary is size. ,5,4,5
"I have been taking this medication for about six months .  I read everything I could before getting started so I was educated on the expectations and side effects.  The problem that I have is that it seems that alot of the medication is left in the vial, even after mixing well.  Worried that I may not be getting the full dose and effect.  Otherwise love the once a week dosing.  Life got a little easier.",2,3,3
My doctor prescribed this without checking my family history. My father died of thyroid cancer. Was anyone else prescribed this med and have thyroid cancer in their family? The medication did not help at all and made me sick all the time. But the worst of it is that now I need to have an ultra sound every year.,2,1,1
"I have been taking Bydureon since the first of December.  At first lots of diarrhea but no other stomach issues.  I think that was more from the increase in Metformin the doc ordered.  The symptom that is bothering me now is that my hair is falling out like crazy.  My bs went from 7,5 to 6.  I am very happy about this.  Have not lost any measurable weight however.  I am turning into a lumpy, fat, bald woman with great numbers.",5,4,5
"I have been a type 2 diabetic for about 17 years now.  I was taking 15mg Actos, 100mg Januvia, 1500mg Metformin...but the issue was I could not tolerate the GI issues of Metformin.  My doctor recommended this Bydureon, took me off the Metformin and Actos and continued me on Januvia.  I am in week 5, seeing great results.  FIrst week I had a little cramping/diarrhea but none since.  Definitely cut my appetite...no adverse issues.  Fasting BS in the 110-115 range, down from 145-165.  My last A1C was 7.2, looking forward to the next one that will be hopefully improved.  I always clean my injection site with alcohol swab before injection, no issues.",4,4,5
love the weight loss I have experienced. Don't know if I can continue because of the severe nausea. This is probably contributing to my weight loss.  I have no evidence but feel like my night sweats and hot flashes are subsiding some also.  My a1c levels are down from 7.9 to 6.7. I'm very pleased with appetite suppression. ,3,3,5
helped me lose 26 lbs in 62 days no side effects i dose a week by injection,5,5,5
"I have completed 7 weeks and blood sugar has dropped significantly. BS has dropped from 280 average morning test to 170 average. I take it with Metformin. The only side effects I've noticed is itching at/near the injection sites and lumps/bumps that measure from half an inch to about 2 inches. Like another reviewer, I had no itching the first 3 weeks and then it began and included all the injection sites. This is the first injection medication I have ever used due to my major fear (irrational but very real) of needles. The ease of use has surprised me and I think it's because dosage is once a week and uses a short needle. In a nutshell, it's very easy to use, I am experiencing great results but the bumps near the injection sites concern me. I'll report back after seeing my doctor in a few days.",4,4,5
"I have now been on Bydureon for about 9 months and no longer have itching at the injection site but still have a welt that lasts for a couple of weeks due to the fact that this medicine is a slow-releasing medication. Due to the fact that I was extremely nauseated all of the time with weekly injections, my doctor decided to try injections every 10 days. It has been a great compromise! I still have periodic bouts of nausea but nothing like before. My fasting BS is around 125-130 instead of my pre-Bydureon days of 190. My Hemoglobin A1c dropped from 8.6 to 6.7. I have had no weight gain because this medicine tends to suppress my appetite. I also take extended release Metformin and Glymeperide every am and pm.",3,4,4
Week three - my legs are swelling and are achy.  Was nauseous and dizzy at first but that has gotten better.  Calling the doctor about my legs.  Something just doesn't seem right.  ,4,3,4
I am taking my 3rd injection tomorrow. Have been checking my sugar every morning and evening and have not seen a significant drop in numbers yet.  Hope it kicks in soon.  Dr. says it takes 3 or 4 weeks to see a difference.  Along with this I also take 4 metformin tablets each day.  Have dropped 10 lbs thought so that is a plus,4,4,3
"I came off of Januvia to start this and after reading others reviews I am not having any problems with itching or nodules at the injection site, my blood sugar readings have come down a bit, but I just took my 5th injection yesterday, my problem is severe headaches during the first 24 hours after injection, some nausea, not enough to stop the medication over, loss of appetite (that I can live with), but with the cost of the drug, I am not sure I will continue to take this.  I already suffer with migraines and the headaches seem to be increasing each week in severity, this weekend being the worst, I just do not have the luxury of giving up every weekend, all weekend to recover from a severe, and I do mean severe headache.  I have seen no loss in weight, I take Metformin and Glipizide in addition to this, was hoping to come off the Glipizide, but I am thinking I may have to test next weekend and go without the medication to see if I will have a headache or not.  We will see.",5,2,3
"I am now on my second week with this medication.  I love that it has only to be done once a week.  This makes it soo convenient for me.  I have no problems with lumps or other side effects.  I don't see the number lowering as much as I would like to.  I am thinking that my meter needs to be replaced and will try doing that and monitoring for an additional week or so.  he best thing for me is the convenience of only 1 week shot instead of 3 times a day or 21 shots.  I am being optimistic that it will work and I start to see substantial lower numbers.  Right now I am only seeing slightly lower number and a flucuation but again, it is probably due to my meter.",5,3,3
"I was prescribed for treatment of insulin resistence AND off-label weightloss.  I have been taking it for 8 weeks and seen no improvements in my gloucose levels, and no weightloss.  I have had severe side-effects - hard lumps under the skin at the injection site, severe iching at the injection site (up to a week or longer), constipation, some nausea, and headaches.",2,1,1
"My husband started taking this a couple of months ago in place of gly-buride. Each injection site has a knot under the skin. This cannot be a good thing!  The only thing that can be happening is the medication is crystalizing in the muscle after injection.  Everyone seems to be ok with this and accepting it as an acceptable side effect.  The doctor said it was a normal side effect.  However his muscles are not being used, so what would he know? I wonder what long term side effects will come of these knots?",2,1,1
Bydureon definetly has helped me!!! Nausea was horrible in the begining but has gotten better. I do have hard knots under my skin where I have given my shots in my stomach. I wasn't aware of this side affect & wished the doctor would have told me so I wouldn't have freaked out when I found the first little knot.,5,4,5
"I'd been on Byetta for about 2 1/2 years.  Since starting Bydureon my blood sugar has been quite high.  Readings mostly in the 200's.  My doctor has increased my Actos from 15 mg to 30 mg per day.  It's too soon to tell if there will be an improvement.  Taking only one shot a week is great, that way I don't have to watch what time I eat.  I hope my sugar levels improve.",5,3,2
"I have been on this med for 4 weeks now.  At first I had diarrhea pretty bad, but that cleared up at the end of week 2.  I still am not real hungry and my sugar levels are getting better.  I shoot into my thigh and I have not had any itching, redness or lumps like others seem to be having.  I also seem to have a little upset stomach from time to time or if I eat something more than I am use to eating.  So far so good on this med.   ",4,3,4
I HAVE HAD A LOT OF STOMACH ISSUES.I HAVE ALSO HAVE BIG LUMPS THAT ARE VERY RED AND VERY ITCHY.MY SUGAR HAS TESTED A LITTLE LOWER THAN BEFORE. I HAVE TAKEN THIS FOR 8 WEEKS AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH IT OR NOT.,2,1,2
I feek along with my metformin my sugar is in control all the time.  It is much easier than remembering to take daily.,5,5,5
"I was on Victoza for 2 years with little change in my blood sugar (average BS=190) and became more nauseated with each injection. I have been on Bydureon for 3 months and have seen my blood sugar values drop to normal (average BS=90) for the first time in 7 years. I lost 12 lbs in 3 months and have very little appetite to eat anything other than 3 square meals a day. I have noticed sporatic bouts of extreme nausea happening throughout the day but try to manage it with mint-flavored gum or sips of ginger ale. I have found that giving the Bydureon injection much more difficult compared to the Victoza injection because the needle is so much larger, the medication is much thicker and more difficult to inject, the injection site itches all week long, and a nodule is left under the skin and lasts for several months. There is a warning to watch blood sugar levels if taking other oral BS meds. I have seen some lows such as 47 and 54. I have become familiar with the dull ache at the base of my skull which reminds me to eat something to get my BS back up. I am satisfied with the results but not with the experience of injecting or feeling nauseated.",3,3,5
I have only taken one shot and the next tomorrow.I have noticed my sugar levels down a good bit. I have also not been hungry. I was on Victoza everyday and we are trying this once a week to see if it helps with my appatite.,3,3,4
I took the daily shot for several years. Now trying the once a week. For the last 4 months. It has left multiple large bumps in my thighs that are not going away. I really do not notice any effect of the drug at all. Considering stopping the medication. Not enough visible effect for the price of the medication. Exercise and diet works better.,1,1,1
I have injected the drug 2 times into my abdomen.  The 2nd time I took the injection I had a severe reaction at the site of the injection which also inflamed the first injection site.  I suffered severe burning and itching and no creams or gels stopped the burning and itching. 8 weeks later I still have hard red lumps and itching at the injection site.  I am considering discussing this with an attorney.,1,1,1
"I had been using Bydureon for 8 weeks, when I started having severe stomach cramping along with vomiting and diarrhea. I thought it was the flu at first. Then I started noticing a pattern.  I was getting sick the day before I was due for another injection, this went on for 4 weeks. My Dr. took me off immediately.  I've not been taking it for 6 weeks and I'm still not back to normal. Be cautious with this drug. ",4,1,2
"I have only taken 2 shots. The shots have been easy to assemble and to inject. I haven't taken it long enough to know its effectiveness, that's the reason for the low score. I'm not satisfied yet. I'm having large injection site bump (about 2cm long), with reddness and itching. The itching is aggravating, never goes away. I might have a slight decrease in appetite.",4,1,2
"I have been on this medication for eight weeks with blood sugars now higher than before I started taking this drug.  Each injection site continues to have a lump or node that is not disappearing. Each new injection swelled to about the size of my hand and began itching.  I have had two bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting which I first attributed to the flu, but now have realized it was probably a side effect of Bydureon.  Thankfully, my doctor stopped this med. but I think my reaction and dissatisfaction was not normal. My doctor and his nursing staff had not seen such a severe reaction to the drug and I am not totally convinced it is really safe.",3,1,1
"Blood sugar is stable, but my A1c was at 5.6 when I started using this 2 months ago.  My Dr. Just wants it lower.  I have just lost 50 lbs, and Dr. said this would help with weight and lower A1c, too.  Maybe, but I have lumps everywhere I have injected the drug, and they itch.  One has turned into a bad sore. AND, MY HAIR IS FALLING OUT!  No! I'm not kidding.  Nothing else has changed in my diet in the last 7 months... And the hair loss started with my use of Bydureon. I will see my Dr. next week and hopefully stop this stuff! I don't need to be a bald 59 year old woman.",4,1,3
I have been on Bydureon for about 4 weeks. My numbers are gradually coming down into the mid 150's.  The Doctor (and the Bydureon studies) say that max effectiveness or steady-state occurs around 6 weeks. Side effects are the nodes in my stomach that also itch sometimes (the itching is gradually going away as well.  Some nausea.,4,4,4
"I have been taking this med for 8 weeks, and have experienced swelling and itching at the injection site.  I have had stomach upset while taking this med.  I have not see any beneficial reduction of my blood sugars and not have not benefited from any weight loss.  Appetite has not changed.  I had better results with Byetta and will ask my dr at next visit to go back to Byetta.",3,2,2
"I took my 6th dose of Bydureon yesterday.  My blood sugars are perfect!  The majority of my sugars have been in the 90 to 130 range EVEN AFTER MEALS.  I was taking 50 units of Lantis @ night and using Humalog to cover as needed.  I am now down to 15 units of Lantis and will probably continue to reduce this slowly.  I have not had any bumps or redness or itching.  I have had nausea and diminished appitite; as a result I have lost 7 pounds aleady.  Except for the nausea, this is a miracle drug for me.  I does cause me a bit of concern that it has not been on the market very long.  I am hoping that I can lose enough weight that maybe I can go off all meds and just be diet controlled.  That would certainly make life easier.",3,5,5
"After my third shot, the first two shot areas started to itch and a red raised 2"" circle showed. The day after the third shot, it also raised and started itching.  The sort of itch that keeps you up all night & anti-itch creams do not seem to help. My doctor/nurse was not able to help with an explanation.",4,1,3
"I've been on bydureon for about 3 months and I'm having great results.  The nausea was a problem at first, but that had gone away.  I'm showing great numbers, between 100 and 120 very consistently.  This is the first injectible med I've ever used, and only considered it because it's once a week.  It really has helped to control my diabetes and it feels good to see results that back up my diet and exercise efforts!",4,5,5
have had high numbers and constant diahrrea since first injection.  have gone back on Byetta and numbers came down.  still fighting the diahrrea but assuming time to get the other out of my system,5,1,1
Just started yesterday. My readings were around 145 but after taking this last night this morning it was 167. I have to wait for few weeks i guess. Will update my review again next week. No side effects uptil now but too early to say.   Week 1 Day 1 - 167,4,2,1
"I've been this medication for three weeks now and the nausea has been a problem.  Hopefully it will go away so.  Sugars are starting to look good, about where they should be.",4,4,3
"Started this med about 2 weeks ago, and am not sure if this is for me. I stick to a diet, take prescribed meds, but my readings have been 167 or higher. When I was on byetta, I had readings 100 and under. How long does it take before I start to see improved fasting results? Enjoy the convenience of a single shot, and have had no significant side effects. Just waiting for good results......",5,2,2
"I switched from Byetta to Bydureon two nights ago and have been hungry ever since. With Byetta, I was hungry only in the late afternoon. My readings are also high. Has anyone else experienced a delay in results?",2,2,1
Just started this med & hopng for good results. Am experiencing nausea & light headedness.  Injection site has bump & it is itching but not unbearably. No noticable diff in my appetite though. Will update as things progress.,4,3,4
"The nausea is a real problem for me.  The reason I lost weight was that I couldn't eat much.  The inject site STILL has itching and lumps in spite of the fact that I started in my abdomen a month ago and it's still hard, red and itching.",3,2,3
"I was prescribed this medication for my newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. I was unable to take Metformin (too many GI issues) and my doctor thought this medication would help me lose weight and bring my glucose levels down. It has done both, although the weight loss has been due to a total lack of appetite since I began the medicine. On the whole, I am happy with the weekly option and plan to continue using it.",4,5,5
I really waited a long time for this medicine to be approved. I loved the fact that it was so convenient with a dose of once a week. But the side effect was hard on my stomach: Painful heartburn and acid indigestion.,5,1,1
It is wonderful to have a medication that not only works but I only have to take once a week. I used to have to worry about taking my medication with me (Byetta) when dining out.  I would take it in the vehicle before dinner but now I can actually eat out like a normal person.  It is absolutely wonderful.  I have no spikes or lows.  I wake up with an average of 125 and go to bed with an average of 130.  How wonderful is that?  I do watch my food intake just like any diabetic but I don't worry about the highs and lows like I did with Byetta or other previous medications.  I also take Metformin as an addition but 2 pills a day is much easier than 2 shots a day and 2 pills a day.  I would have never guessed my life would be somewhat normal again after diabetes.  Thank you Bydureon!,5,5,5
"It takes a few weeks before the medication gets to a ""steady state"" in your system, but in my case it works well. The injector is easy to use and painless. I get bumps at the injection sights that go away after a few weeks, but I guess this is a coomon side effect. No pain or discoloring, just a bump.",5,4,4
"The injector is GARBAGE.It will(most of the times) squirt out when you remove the cap. It can fail to penetrate the skin.I cant believe they tested this injector before releasing it. I've used other medication (like trulicity) medication didn't work for me,but injection was decent) but on this one I can't say if medication works or not because the delivery method is so bad is behind terrible. ",2,1,2
"The injector is garbage.  It can squirt out when you remove the cap. It can fail to penetrate the skin because of the shroud around the needle.  If you can get it injected, it seems to work.  I cant believe they tested this injector before releasing it.  ",4,2,4
I have been a n Byetta for a year and don’t see any difference . Going to tell my doctor I am quitting it. Waste of money .,5,1,1
"The affect is excellent, however, the needle is huge and is difficult to use without drawing blood!  Compared to the Insulin Pen it is longer, bigger, and difficult to use without pain.",4,3,4
I have been taking Byetta since July 2010 and had no problems whatsoever. Keeping my A1C at 7.2 since. ,5,5,5
"Horrible drug. uncontrolled nausea and vomiting, almost complete hair loss and very jittery so I couldn't sleep. I will never touch it again",1,1,1
My insurance company stopped covering this drug in July of 2015.  It was great at controlling my Type II and I hope to get it covered again soon.  Victoza is simply not doing the job.  I tried Bydereon the weekly exenatide injection and the coverage was very good too.  But the needle was horribly painful and it left a lump at the injection site.,5,3,5
"Works to curb your appetite for over eating .Better be near a bathroom when you get stomach cramps , you got about 4 mins. to find one or get into a shower.  ",3,2,3
on day 2 and i am not hungry at all had a yogurt for breakfast and i feel like i could go and barf   i hope it does not go on for 2 weeks like i have been reading ,5,5,5
I ended up with kidney stones. stopped Byetta...no more kidney stones.,4,2,4
"Drug has worked well for diabetes, lost weight, brought A1C down.  I was unable to go to the 10 units twice a day because of stomach issues. Question, has anyone been having bladder infections chronic after being on Byetta for an extended time?",4,4,4
I am on my 3rd pen and I am starting to see results now. It really makes me nauseous. ALSO I have had a lot of depression since I started with Byetta. Is this a reported side effect? That is not normal for me BUT I am going through a lot so may be coincidental??,4,3,3
I took Byetta for only two days and had severe pain in my abdomen and back.  It felt like bad gas pressure without the gas.  My dr told me to stop taking right away.  I have not taken for a few days any I still have a little pain after I eat but it is getting better as time goes on.  ,4,1,1
Lost ALL my hair on my head and body.  Went through extensive treatment and nothing worked until I stopped using byetta.  Full head of hair now.  Wouldn't touch it again!,5,5,5
I am totally pleased with Byetta and my lab results are great. My Dr. has reduced and eliminated some of my diabetic meds. As a secondary issue my appetite is suppressed and I've lost 40 lbs.,5,5,5
I started having sharp pain in my stomach.  I would jump because of the sharp pains and wake my husband.  I only tried this for 1 month.,1,1,1
"I've been on it for two full months.I started with 5mg. for a month then 10mg. for the second month.I'm starting my 2nd. 10mg. pen and my third month. I've experienced some loose stools during the first two weeks  then back to normal. I've had no other adverse effects and my sugar has gone down from the 230 range to the 150 range and hopefully still dropping. My weight has gone from 365 to 340. I noticed that I don't want to eat as much, the effect is very subtle but I've learned to recognize it and I just push away from the table. So far everything's thumbs up.",4,5,5
"I was given byetta for type 2 diabetes, it was the first form of insulin they tried on me. I had gained a huge amount of weight, from 220 up to 317. my diabetes was out of control. all I wanted to do was eat sweets and sleep. After starting the byetta, it was about 3 weeks, I started to notice weight loss. I gradually lost my desire to eat sweets all the time, and started staying awake more and more, I felt much better but still had to keep an eye on my sugar levels. Within 6 months I had gone down in weight from the 317 to 212 and then lost a little more gradually ending up at 205, a weight that both I and my Doctor was happy with. But within the next 6 to 8 months I started craving sweets again and gradually putting on weight. I am now at 235, wich is still on the good side. at least its not 317. He started me on a new shot called xxxxxxx that also has the same possible side effects, but has started helping me get back on the right track again. My sugar is pretty much under control,and I am losing weight again, but dont expect the medication alone to do it for you. a lot of work goes into taking care of yourself when you are diabetic. Do a lot of reasearch, ask your doctor questions you need answers to, But make sure you keep up with diet and exercise. Its hard at first but you will get use to it.Good Luck",4,3,3
"Given Byetta when Metformin stopped being enough.  Terrible nausea for 2 weeks, some nausea always.  Took for 5 years, doc switched me to Victoza, which was awful as it gave me sewer mouth.  Back to Byetta.  One known side effect not often mentioned was that the Byetta threw me back to fertile stage of life after having gone through menopause.  So had to go through that again. Oh, yea!  Worst thing was having to take it with me to work for dinner, and then forgetting to take it home. Lost 30 pounds in first 4 months, then nothing.  That was probably due to being unable to eat after dinner from the nausea.  Got me into the habit of not eating after dinner though! Yea!  Expensive, but insurance company didn't hassle me about it like they did with less expensive Victoza.  Would have lots of tiredness when stressed, but that may have been just the stress.  General health improved.  Love the drug; glad to be back on Byetta. Second time around bad nausea only 3-4 days. It seems like Byetta slows down the digestion later in the process than in the stomach so didn't have the rotting contents syndrome that Victoza gave me (belching; sewer mouth).  Sucking salty items like olives and dill pickle slices controlled the nausea.",4,4,5
"I just started using Byetta the beginning of Nov and am quite pleased so far. I have lost 7 lbs, but my fasting sugar is still ranging from 190 - 265. I'm sure my Dr will up this when I see him.  No bad reactions",5,5,5
"I was prescribed Byetta on a test basis to see if it would decrease me need for insulin.  It did--permanently.  It also gave me SEVERE indigestion--to the point that I had to discontinue the Byetta after only 1 month.  (I work behind a service counter, & have to look & be healthy at all times when on duty.)",5,2,5
tiredness and weight gain,5,3,3
"My father took this and a year later he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Went from feeling fine to some jaundice symptoms one day, went to dr, and all our lives changed. He passed away a few weeks ago. Be careful",1,1,1
"I've had Type 2 for 13 yrs now and oral medicines weren't doing the job for the last two yrs. Byetta was suggested by a VEBA study pharmacist I work with and my doctor agreed. I started on 5 mcg on July 27,2012.Immediately my bs went down from morning highs of 160-180 to 120-100. Adverse side effects included jitteriness and constipation of which constipation still exist. I power Metamucil and try and eat all the non-starchy vegetables I can. Weight is down 5#. As mentioned the Nano needles coupled with the Byetta pen are virtually painless. I predict my A1C will drop to 6.0 from 7.0% net test. Looks like 5 mcg is going to do it. I also take 2500 mg of Metformin and 10 mg Glipizide XL. I forgot to mention that fatigue and sleepiness prevail from the Byetta. I'm blessed with an extremely generous drug plan.",4,4,5
Ihave had good results,5,4,4
This medication has helped keep by sugar levels down. With out it my sugar levels are much higher.,4,4,4
I had nausea for about 2 weeks when I first started taking it.  It went away...so did my appetite.  I've been on it alittle over two years and now I have nausea about every time I take it and pain in the abdomen some.,5,4,5
I just stated taking it today and I am feeling willing feel like i want to throw up. I have a headake.,2,2,2
Upset stomach in the first 2 weeks which went away over time.  No side effects at this time and have been using it for the last 3 months.,3,5,5
dr. is going to start me on this med. Can anyone tell me if the nausea is just on first of taking it or all week?,1,1,1
I started this med on 2/7/12 and had to stop taking the med less than two weeks later after being diagnosed with pancreatitis,1,1,1
I went from a a1c of 9+ to 6.5 & my sugars were running around 4-500 & went down to the 200's which my dr said was good for my and my size. 6'4 & 240#.,5,5,5
"been on for 1 week and have lost 4LBS. no sickness, sugars are 1/2 what they were.injections hurt far less than lancets!miracle drug for my type 2.appetite is 1/4th what used to be. looking forward to next A1c.",5,5,5
It has helped me lose close to 30 pounds in the last 4 months and has kept my levels under control,5,5,5
I was on Byetta 5 and 10 for about 2 months.  Injections in the stomach caused nausau so I injected into the thigh.  This reduced nausau some but constipation followed.  My blood suger levels did not improve so my doctor put me on insulin.  I really wanted Byetta to work for me but maybe it's not for everybody.,5,1,1
"Blood sugar dropped dramatically, and I lost about 40 lbs very quickly.  I did have a lot of nausea with it, but that got a little better the longer I stayed on it.  I went off it after developing pancreatitis.  Really wish I could've kept taking it.",5,2,5
sometimes have low blood sugar after taking byetta,3,2,5
"My A1c dropped dramatically as hoped. However,even tho I take 2 Metamucil caps a day I am still constipated from the Byetta. Not sure what to do about it. Nausea went away after first week.",5,3,5
Been on this drug for the last 4 years. I inject myself 2X a day 10mg each. First 2 years at 5mg 2X a day. I have vomitting during the 1st week of use then got use to it. I inject myself at 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner at my belly or bicept.,3,5,4
"I have been type 2 for over 10 years and have been using Byetta for over 2 years, i have not received the weight loss everyone else has chatted about but i am happy with results. Also I have been taken off glyburide since i started taking this....",5,4,4
I just started this medication a few days ago. I have already had a significant drop in my blood sugar numbers. I had nausia with my first dose and realized I was not eating enough so I incresed my food a little and have not had anymore problems. I am actually feeling the best I have felt in years. I have taken Byetta for less than a week and have lost 4 pounds and have tons of energy to play with my kids now! I am very very happy with this medication!,5,5,5
"My doctor started me on the highest dose when my A1c was 7.3 after surgery. Made me violently  ill, but I foolishly kept taking it trying to adjust. I now have a non-working pancreas, bad stomach and take insulin.",5,1,2
my gi tract virtually stopped and my reflux was terrible. I know why people lose weight. anything I ate repeated and i was not ever hungry just reall nauseous. was 1 day close to pancreatitis.,5,1,1
i have not experienced the highs and lows that i was expecting has been very easy to use and to control,5,4,3
"I took Byetta for over a year, starting with 5 and then going to 10. Initial weight loss was 20 pounds but after 7 months I had no further weight loss and quesiontioned why I was injecting this twice a day. Also could not tolerate metformin-sever leg pain. With no change in diet weight began to creep up. I am now beginning 6 months of  excercise and nutrition as a bariatric candidate. I want health and it seems the more drugs I tried, the worse I felt. I don't feel surgery is the best option, but feel the 6 months in preparation will have shown me all of my options. In total I was on Byetta for 14 months. Has anyone else experienced the loss of effectiveness?",5,2,3
"I took the 5mg Byetta for the first month then moved on to the 10mg. Yes, there was extreme nausea for the first 6 weeks but this did subside. I found eating high fat/spicy foods caused more nausea so I stayed away from them. There was weight loss. It does teach you to eat your big meal at lunch and helps you not eat all the time. Unfortunately, as I started my 4 month my enjection sites became swollen and itchy. My whole body started to itch as well. I stopped using it for a month and I am trying it again. Hoping my body can tolerate it. It is worth putting up with the nausea. I highly recommend it.",5,4,5
"Byetta makes me so nauseous I need to lie down after eating. It is especially bad in the afternoons, post-lunch. I will give it high marks in reducing appetite in that I've managed to lose weight in a steady pace.",4,2,4
I Have lost about 65 lbs.My a1c is now 5.7 down from 7.8 ,5,5,5
"Have been on 5 mcg since first of the year.  While A1C is down just a bit, I also haven't been diligent about my diet.  Job I have, it is difficult to eat at regular mid-day meal times.  Dr. now wants me to try 10 mcg -- will this be safe?  Had nausea but no vomiting for first week or so w/5 mcg.  Otherwise this has been okay.",4,3,3
"i have used it for a month& no weight loss and have stomach pain almost everyday!I don't have insurance but got it free tru the manufactor of byetta!ask your doctor or go to their website for more info!I didnt get the needles free,but its better then paying for the shots!!",4,3,3
"I have type 2 insulin resistant diabetes, I had gained almost 100 pounds, when I started using Byetta I started losing weight. at first I had stomach pain and was sick at my stomach quite a bit and didnt feel like eating, after I had been using it for aboout a month or so I got use to it and have now lost 87 pounds. I feel great. I had gotten over 300 pounds and now am down to about 225, losing another 75 pounds will put me where I want to be. and my sugar level is always good. once in a while it can get to low but I have learned how to hadle that.My doctor is very happy about the results and I have blood work done each time before my next appointment and every thing always looks good.",5,5,5

"This seemed like a promising medication, except for the fact that it FAILED to do all that it was supposed to and stop my body from over producing insulin.  After eating my numbers would drop to 80 and (usually) below.  Thus causing me to (defeating the purpose) eat once again (after taking sugar pills of course.  I tryed taking this medication on several occasions, I even tryed adding carbs...still dropped.  I didn't get the nausea except when I injected Byetta into my arm.",5,1,5

At first i thought oh god another insulin but this is not insulin.  it helps the  pancreas make its own insulin to fight off high blood sugars.  my experience hss been a positive one and am very pleased with the results and so are my doctors.  what i have a problem with now is that my insurance will not pay for it and my wifes insurance will pay some of it but i have to pay over 110 dollars per month and i can't afford it since i AM OUT OF WORK AT THIS TIME.

Started out one month on 5mcg and then 10mcg along with 2000 metformin a day. My A1C before starting Byetta was 10.5 and after 3 months my A1c is 6.9 and BS are running around 120. I lost 32 lbs in the last 3 months. Feel great so far.,4,4,4
Does this medication Byetta com in pill form?,5,5,5
"I have been taking Byetta for 8 months. I tolerated the 5mcg well and my blood sugar level came down. I did not tolerate the 10 as well with a lot of nausea. Spoke to my nutritionist who had me review my diet and said I was not eating enough carbs. The nutritional counseling has been key for me as I grew up thinking potatoes and bread were bad! Learning that if my diet is based on the basic food triangle of protein, vegetables, fruit and carbs, I'll feel better and actually lose weight was difficult. Before I started my weight had been increasing and overeating was not a factor. Just poor choices. With Byetta and a healty diet, I have lost 30 pounds and am now ready to go back up to 10mcg. I have adjusted the timing of my injection to my meal. I was trying to do it an hour prior to eating and my nutritionist suggested eating closer to the time after the injection. Looking forward to moving forward with this.!!! At 57 my quality of life is very important to me. I'm finally ready to take on the responsibility. ",5,5,4
"It is a good drug..I am no longer on Novolog..i do keep it just in case..If i keep my carbs to the minimum, then the med works..my blood sugar will stay under 150..my blood sugar reading in the mornings is 90-120..just where i like it..",5,5,5
WHEN I STARTED WITH IT I WAS VERY NAUSIATED FOR OVER A MONTH AND LOST ALMOST 30#. MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH IT IS REMEMBERING TO TAKE IT WITH ME IF WE GO OUT TO EAT AND BACK AND FORTH TO WORK.,4,4,4
THIS IS THE ONLY MEDS I COULD USE TO CONTROL MY HIGH LEVELS,5,5,5
I have lost alot of weigh off this medicine. Plus blood sugar under control as well.. gives me energy..,4,5,5
when I went to 10mgs I noticed the drug was not working as well as the 5mgs b/s started climbing and so did the weight my Dr. put me on Victoza which is a once adat shot that can be taken anytimr during the day and it has worked great.,5,3,3
"I had horrible diarrhea for 7-8 weeks and could not figure out what was causing it.  Raging diarrhea daily which led to other problems such as dehydration and low blood pressure.  I had stool samples tested for ""c-diff"", but it was not ""c-diff"".  Finally through talking with my endocrinologist and some trial and error, the reason was found to be Byetta.  Since I stopped the Byetta, the diarrhea has ceased.  Hope you don't have this side effect.  Wish I could have continued with it because it shows promise, and insulin alone is not helping me the way that I need it to help.",4,1,2
"I am expericing headaches which are mild, loss of appetite,constapation, and most of all lower abdomen pain , fatique.",5,3,2
I have been taking Byetta for 1 month. I have not had any side effects yet. I have lost 10 pounds and have been eating good without any dieting. I stopped taking Glyburide when I started this. I have just increased to 10 mcg today. My blood sugar has been around 170 from the start. I am hoping that the 10mcg will lower it a bit. So far I am happy with this med.,4,4,4
"Well I have now been on Byetta 10mcg for 2 months, along with one month which is when I first started Byetta with the 5 mcg. I also take 2000mg of Metformin a day along with 10mg. of Glipizide a day. I had my blood work done yesterday and will see my doctor on Aug. 30 to go over my results. The last 2 or 3 weeks have been agervating because of having sour belches and not resting at night because of the gas build up in stomach. I have stated cutting back on how much I eat, even with me not eating a whole lot, I was still getting the sour belches. My readings HAVE come down in a better range than before, around 112 to 150 or so which is still good for me, was 230 or more before Byetta. So hopefully I can tell my doctor when I go see her about my belches and hopefully she can help me on this. I have lost  not any weight at all since I first started Byetta 3 months ago. I haven't gained any either. I drink lots of water and drink maybe 1 soda a week.",5,4,5
"In the beginning when I first started taking Byetta it was a bit of a struggle.  First because I never gave myself an injection, and second because it made me a bit nauseous.  After about two weeks, I felt much better and it is now easy to give myself the shots.  It has also helped in taking weight off.  It's coming off slowing, but that's a good thing.  All in all I highly recommend it for Type II diabetes.",4,5,5
Been a type 2 since 1991. Just started this med 5mcg X 2 on Aug 13. Really cant form an opinion about it yet.I take it with 2000 mg Metformin daily. I can say that it does dull the appitite. BS dropped 100 points. How long before you feel the full effects of this med. Contact me at [email protected],3,3,3
"I have type 2 Diabetes. Also very important: I have 1/3 of a pancreas due to partial pancreactomy to remove mass. 3 years post surgical.  My blood sugar better than it has been in years.  I have lost 20 lbs in 2 months but I eat sensibly and work out regularly with cardio and circuit training.  Only problem that worries me..is that I am having pain in my mid abdomen closer to left side under rib all the time, like a stabbing pain and it just started 2 weeks ago, could be probs with my pancreas but I will need to have my Physician assess. ",2,4,5
"Ive been on 10mg twice daily for 3mths now and although its effective with my blood sugar levels and loss ov weight,but the constant sickness and not eating and drinking is getting me down any suggestions on this i take my injections as directed with my food but to no availe.",5,1,5
"I am insulin dependent but my Doc has me on it anyway he says it works and it does. At one point I told him I didn't want to take it but just last week I asked to get back on it. I have gained weight since being off of it my blood sugars are in the 2 and 300's I feel better when on Byeta with the insulin. I take 20 units of Insulin 2 x day and 10 of Byetta 2 x a day. I keep reading that if you are insulin dependent DO NOT take Byetta but my Doc says it's ok. This is my big concern is anyone else taking insulin and Byetta? Only side effect I have ever had is a ""little"" quezy at my stomach but it doesn't last. I have read that some people have died from Byetta which is why I got scared of taking it.",3,4,5
caused Pancreatitis.,4,1,3
"I have been on Byetta since April, starting with 5mcg then May using 10mcg. I go the last part of Aug to have my AC1 checked again. It was 9.9 last time. I have not lost any weight yet still at 220. I have not GAINED any either. I have tested my sugar at home and Byetta HAS brought it down from the upper 200's down between 110 to 160's which is good for me, I can tell I feel better since being on Byetta. I also take Metformin 1000 mg twice a day along with Glipazide 10mg a time a day.No side effects except if I overload my stomach too much, I get sour belches really bad along with build up of gas. After a day oe 2 it goes away. So I am trying to cut back even more on intake of food. I am discouraged that I have not lost any weight. I am not exercising yet but will be soon on a treadmill. I am going to give it some more time at leat till I can get started exercising.",5,4,5
It has kept my hunger level lower.  I do not as much as I used to and I am satisfied.  One does not have to refrigerate the medicine if not in high temperatures.  I have an insulated pouch to carry with me if I am going to be out in warm weather.  My blood sugar levels have been better.,4,5,5
"I started Byetta Aug 2008, 10mcg twice a day.  Today, 7/20/10, still on the drug,  I've lost 99 pounds - 308 to 209, and my last 3 A1C's have been at 6.0, 6.1 and 5.7 over the period of 1 year.  This has worked great for me!  I've suffered very few side effects, nausea, if any.  I have also been exercising 4 to 5 times per week upwards of 45 minutes per day, since starting back in 8/2008.   ",5,5,5
"When I first starting using the Byetta I got sick one time but that was my own fault I waited too long to eat  . My A1C has went from a 7.5 to 5.5 in less than 3 months, I have lost 10 lbs so far and love the medication,but you have to stick with it to seee good results and watch your diet,the nly symptom I have seen is incomplete emptying of my bowels but thats nothing compared to waking up with blood sugars in 3oo or more.I recommend this to anyone.",5,5,5
"Until recently everything was great but after 5 yrs have started belching up undigested food hrs. after eating, very loose bowels, diarea, occasional vomiting,  heartburn,stomach hurts, and tired.",5,4,5
"I have lost about 35 pounds on Byetta and my A1C is 6.2 I sometimes get sick in the morning after taking it, but it goes away as soon as I eat somthing.    I love this drug, the shot is easy to take and I look fantastic!!",5,5,5
my blood sugar was through the roof byetta got it in control quick,5,5,5
"I have been taking byetta for 3 years and have had some of the side effects nausa, vomiting, but overall I can say that the drug works for me. I have loss weight on the byetta and it helps me control my weight.   It was good to hear that someone got off it but bad to hear that you had to take something else.  I agree there should be more out there for people in our condition to take and not be scare that something is going to happen to you.  To much worry puts to make stress on your body.   ",4,3,5
"I have been taking for approx. 3 months, can see a significant lower blood sugar, have not have A1C yet, no weight loss, yet.",3,4,4
I am going to be having gastric bypass surgery and my doctor and I decided to use byetta over having to crush the pills I am taking.,5,5,5
"This is my first experience with byetta. I had heard so many 'not great' things about it. I have experienced MINOR nausea but it has controlled my blood sugar well. Prior to this my blood sugar was getting a little out of hand. I was also concerned about the metformin because I had reactions to it a while ago (loss of taste-a real bummer!) but things seem to be working OK, Of course it is has only been a week!",2,4,5

Too frequent drops in blood sugars(after meals and during sleep).A1C went from 7.8-6.8,recently back up to 7.0. Have lost 30 lbs. Last visit told need to check colon ,Byetta could affect that.Taking me off Byetta and going on Januvia. Have read up on that and that doesn,t sound any better. What do we do to control better without all of the side affects and health risks?",4,3,4
"Have been on this medication for just over a year this Thanksgiving.  Have lost 85 lbs. Also taking Metformin.  Digestive side effects happen when consuming fatty foods (i.e. fast foods) or too many carbs.  I have reached by goal weight and my A1C at my last visit was 5.3.  Would recommend this drug.  You just need to modify the types of food you eat.  Also, taking the shot in your thighs minimizes the nausea.",5,5,5
I have almost complete control of my blood sugers with Byetta.  ,4,5,5
I always check blood sugar everyday in my house and go to the hospital everymonth.,3,1,1

"This helped my blood sugar levels almost immediately, but after 6 months of use I had stomach problems and was diagnosed with gastroparesis. My doctor told me to stop the Byetta immediately as one of its functions is to slow gastric emptying. I now take pills and 24 hr insulin which works well but I still have stomach pain and gastroparesis.",3,1,4
"After my new dr. took me off Avandia & started me on Byetta, I have found my hunger greatly reduced, losing wt. steadily, and have lost all side effects of my prior medication.  I take this along with Janumet.  My A1C is down so far from 10.3 to 7.3!!",4,5,5

I love it, the best I have felt since being diabetic.  Blood sugar and A1c are good.  No problems at all with Byetta.  I love it!!!! ",5,5,5
"Was not aware (at 1st), of the need to discontinue Glucatrol with this drug. I had many extreme lows, landing in the ER. I did lose 20-30 lbs after a course of intense vomiting after each meal.  Then, the endo told me to stop the Glucotrol. Now, after meals my blood sugar is a little higher than I really want it to be, but, at least I'm not ending up passed out on my way to the ER. She said lows are very uncommon with Byetta, if used without te Glucotrol. I have been taking it just 1x/day as I eat my largest meal 1x, in the afternoon. Since the beginning of January, I have not lost one pound.  So, I have decided I need to take it 2x/day, even if I'm not eating alot. Hope it starts working soon!",4,3,4

the only thing i have a problem is with my skin i developed  small circles on my skin looks alittle like ringworm but center is not dry and patchy anybody have any ideas thought maybe fungus.,5,5,4
"The medication was great in supressing my appetite.  But, insurance would no pay for it because it as not FDA approved.  Be sure to find out , get pre approved for med.  It is very expensive.",5,4,4
"I started using this medication 2 years ago, and my A1C was over 7.5.  Now my daily glucose levels are around 90-110 and my last A1C was 5.0  I use it in conjunction with Metformin and the combination has worked well for me. ",4,4,5

"I have not had a good experience with Byetta. I’ve only used it for about 6 weeks. It was very hard for my Doctor to get my insurance to pay for it. I used to take Medformin pills. After talking to my Doctor, we thought that Byetta would work.  I’ve gained 15 pounds in 6 weeks. I have this uncontrollable hunger for sweets. This is very unusual for me. My BS were around 200 every day. I’m sure this is because of all the deserts I’ve been eating. With Medformin my BS were never over 110. After I stopped taking the Byeatta, I don’t crave deserts anymore. I don’t care about having crabs. Now I have to work on taking the weight I gained off.  Byetta may work for some people; it did not work for me",2,1,1

"Was on 2,000 mg of Metformin and Januvia and was doing great with perfect BS.  Unfortunately, the Januvia quit working after a little over a year so the doctor started me on 5 mcg Byetta for a month and then went up to 10 mcg with continuing the Metformin at 2,000. I'm on my second month (just started 10 mcg) and have lost almost 10 lbs.  BS has been in line for the most part. I'm also looking forward to the once a week shot and continuing to drop the weight.  Good Stuff!!!",5,5,5
"When I started on Byetta in April 2009, my A1c was 9 and I weighed 220 lbs.  My A1c is now 5.4 and I weigh 185 lbs.  I am also taking 1000 mg of metformin 2X a day.  I do have to be careful because sometimes my blood sugar does go uncomfortably low.  I see a Nurse Practioner and I am going to talk to her about reducing my metformin.  When I first started the Byetta, I did have some stomach upset, but that stopped within 2 weeks and I haven't had any trouble since.",5,5,5
I was on byette 2 times when I first started it made me deathly sick every time I took it every day all day long. NO relief at all.

I thought I would die that is how sick I was. I had to get 2 pints of blood cause my blood count went real low and now I live in the fear of loosing a kidney.  I really wish I had never went on this the good blood sugar reading was not worth just about loosing my life and not living my life with my 2 wonderful grandkids that was born after all this happened,3,1,3

Extremely painful gas, upset stomach, nausea, and chills with the night time dose.  I hope my doctors let me go off of this soon I hate this medication! I feel horrible, and have not lost weight.  I am also on Glumetza.  I do not have diabetes but I have insulin resistance due to Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome.",1,1,2
"Taking Byetta for insulin resistance and uncontrolled weight gain. I have lost about 12 lbs in 2 months. The nausea (more like car sickness, or morning sickness at times) ended after 1 week on 5mg; returned and has continued on the 10mg dose; sometimes feel cold for a few hours afterward, constipation is a problem and I have to be mindful to eat fiber and drink fluids; two episodes of dumping syndrome (embarrassing!!) and occasional vulvar itching. I am amazed at the appetite control, have reduced my portion size by 60% and no longer crave carbs, though occasionally, need to eat a hard candy.

Before I started taking Byetta, I had terrible problems with diarrhea.  Now that I am taking both Metformin and Byetta, I do not have those problems. I have lost 8 pounds in one month, I have reduced the amount of Metformin that I am taking and my blood sugars are great.  I am very happy with this medication.  However, if I overeat I suffer greatly with indigestion to the point of throwing up....that only happened two times....in the very beginning.  No problems at all with this medication.",5,5,5
"On a 10mg dose twice daily, I had all the bad side effects and more. Vomiting, painful stomach, dizzyness, double vision, discoloration of urine. After the 1st month I had to get off it. On the good side: it did regulate my bloodsugar levels, and I lost weight.  ",3,1,4

Now I just use Byetta and Metformin (reduced amount). The nausea was the most difficult part but I've found that if I eat right after I inject myself I don't get the queasy feeling.

They indicated I should contact my doctor.  I also get nausated if I have any fried foods.  I am not sure I will stay on this drug.",5,2,4
This is nothing but an expensive appetite control medication. The reason the blood sugar level stay low is because very little food is consumed. Injection gave me painful nausea for 1 to 2 hours first 2 weeks. I have stopped taking the medication due to nausea. I weight 175  ,1,1,1
Before taking Byetta my blood sugar would average around 250 while on glimepride 4mg. and metphormine 1000 mg. But thats without much diet or excercise. then my doctor added Byetta It averaged around 100 on my readings. I couldn't believe it.,5,5,5
I've been on byetta for about a year and have lost 20 lbs. It does hold my appetite down but my blood sugars are still too high. A1c is 8.5. Has anyone taken byetta along with insulin? If so how is it going?,5,3,3
"Been on 5 mcg since it was first released to the public about 5-6 years ago.  Have discontinued. Diarreah that never stops, sometimes unannounced! Had colonoscopy and a very large precancerous polyp with a huge mushroom like stem was removed.  Was it from byetta?  don't know! Doc said it could have been growing for about 5 years! Had constant acid reflux while on Byetta, even while taking Nexium. Did lose about 5 - 10 lbs... altho not severely overweight. Best effect was lowering of A1C's and glucose numbers.  At present just taking 2000 mg. metformin.  I feel that this polyp was a result of using Byetta for 5-6 years.  Be wary and be sure to get a colonoscopy.  The polyp was of abnormal size and I believe could never have grown that large unless there was an attributing factor introduced into the colon.  I feel it was the Byetta that caused it to mutate!!! Be careful of this drug and continue to be closely monitored by a gastroenterologist as well as your endocrynologist",3,1,4
my belly started to swell,5,1,1
"I was diagnosed with diabetes on May 17,2009. I have lost 35 pounds with change in eating style(healthier) and an 1hr to an 1 1/2 hrs of exersize daily. I was nauseated the first time I took Byetta and one other time after that. I am still on 5mcg, 2x's daily and my blood sugars have been anywhere from 80-115 on average.I found that Byetta does not like fat. So I no longer eat red meat or anything with alot of fat for dinner, that is when I am most affected. I will instead eat red meat such as a hamburger or steak for lunch and watch my fat intake more at dinner. I am healthier than I have been in years and I am glad my doctor prescribed Byetta. There are two things that I have learned since being diagnosed with diabetes, the first is that I can eat anything I want, I just have to do it in moderation and along with my food plan, and that those people that say you shouldn't diet you just need to change your lifestyle they are right. It only takes 30 days to change a habit  good, or bad.",4,5,5
good,5,4,4
"I am newly diagnosed and have been miserable on this drug....gastrointestinal side effects noted by manufacturer made life difficult. I have stopped using drug, as I can't function with the side effects.  Lost 8 lbs in one month, but not worth the side effects.",2,1,1
"I have been on the 5 MCG dose for about 10 days with no adverse effects whatsoever. Blood sugar readings are coming back in control, but not as much as I would like. My appetite is somewhat less and my weight is headed down.",5,5,4
"I have been on Byetta 5 mcg 2X a day for 3 months.  I have PCOS and a thyroid issue, I have lost 11 lbs. in the 3 months.  I give the injections in my thigh, I found I didn't have any nausea that way.  I just went to the doctor today and she upped my Rx to 10 mcg 2X a day.  Hopefully, I will be able to lose more weight.  Also taking Cytomel 15 mcg 2X a day, Snythroid 25 mcg once a day, and Seasonique - to try and stop my periods.  Not trying to get pregnant, already have 2 beautiful children.",4,4,4
5 mcg worked okay. Used 10 mcg for about 4 weeks and vomitted atleast half the time I used it and had bad nausea the other half. When I would vomit my BS would get as low as 30's and 40's. Also would get jittery and rapid pulse hours after taking it and while BS were in the 100's. Switching back to 5 mcg to see if that will work better. ,1,1,2
"I have been on this drug for 6 weeks. The doctor put me on it because I had to stop taking the medication that kept my sugar down because of chonic renal failure. My sugar has remained high, have nausa and I am so irriatable. I go back to my doctor next week and I am going to ask if there is anything I can take in its place.",4,1,1
byetta has dropped my sugar level a 100 points over the last few months after my oral pil ls alone didn't help much. there was a period of nausa that has since faded but still occur occasionally,5,5,5
i was told it was good for weight loss,1,1,1
My wife took this medication while in the hospital taking antibotic treatment for a MRSA infection. She lost 30 pounds in the process but went completely batty taking Baetta. Her electrolytes wnt completely out of wack. I had to take her to the emergency room and she spent 5 days in the hospital. It may work for some people but for her it liked to have killed her. She was told at the hospital that another 10 hours and she would have been in serious trouble. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING BEFORE TAKING THIS MEDICATION!,4,1,1
I have been on byetta for 1 year and have lost 50 lbs. I really have had no side effects and my aic went from 7.8 to 6.2.,5,5,5
"Have mild nausea, try to eat within an hour of taking 10 mcg.  Have been on byetta 1.5 months and have loss 23 lbs. My numbers are normal for the first time in years. 80-120...",5,5,5
"Becareful not to use the pen to conclusion, the medicine is very date sensitive for me.  No problems except minor nausea and lack of big weight loss.  I've gone from 335 to 320 in about a year.",5,5,4
"I have been on Byetta for four months.  I did experience Nausea when going from the 5mg pen to the 10mg pen.  After I began the 10mg pen, my liver enzyme labs began to spike.  After ultrasound, cat scan, MRI, and Hepatitis tests, I was taken off the Byetta with an immediate result of lower liver enzymes. I assume I will be taken off the Byetta now, I've lost 50lbs on it combined with Weight Watchers.  Has anyone else experience high liver enzymes?",3,5,4
"It caused a slow emptying of the stomach and I had to take reglan along with nexium. I noticed that it actually worked similar to Alli drug for weight loss, except taken along with Glugophage it increased the excessive bathroom visits. ",3,2,3
"I have gone trough 2 of the 5mcg tubes, and in the begining of a 10mcg syringe...I had some nausea in the begining, but nothing to get into a twist over. Since the second or third day, I have adjusted well. The first thing I noticed was my appetite was definitely under arrest. I have managed to go from 316lbs. to 282lbs. I have to mention that I play basketball once a week and walk everyday (half an hour or so). ",4,5,4
"I read all the reviews and I became concerned about taking Byetta because of the reports of nausea and vomiting.  I finally psyched myself up and I started my 5mcg injections in the thigh as people had suggested that it would alleviate the nausea.  I am pleased to say that I did not even feel the injection, and there was no nausea until later in the day and it was more of a queasy feeling than nausea and as soon as I ate a small snack it went away.  Five days into this I feel great, no bad side effects at all.  I highly recommend this and I've discovered that the incidences of nausea and other undesirable side effects is very minimal compared to the number of people who take the drug with no discomfort or complications.   ",5,5,4
I have been taking Byetta for about a year with good success.  There is a side effect of moderate to severe nausea so you must follow the directions of eating within the hour of taking your shot.  It does help bring down the BS and I have lost a moderate amount of weight (about 20 lbs).  It certainly does suppress your appetite.  ,4,3,4
Endocrinologist in Oregon put me on 5mg dose several years ago and it worked great. Tried uping dose to 10 but that appears to be too stong...cut back to 5mg and is working great. A1C stays 5.8 to 6.0. Then moved to NM and went to VA. The system wanted to try something cheaper and numbers have been much higher and am gaining weight fast..even with eating less.  So am going back on Byetta so long as can find the money to pay for it...no insurance. ,4,5,5
"Reduced sugars substantially, kept me off insulin for 3 years",3,5,5
"I started this drug on July 14th. I had terrible nausea and diarrhea. Then I went to headaches and constipation. I found that with other reviews the leg injection site works much better for the nausea. I also altered what I ate and when. I tried doing the thigh for injections, eating a half hour after the injection and not eating carbs for the first meal after the injection. I found that by doing this there was next to no nausea and the headaches were reduced.  I am currently taking the injection only in the am because the second dose in the pm was too much to start.  I have lost 4 pounds. I found that mentally I had to reset my eating habits. I have metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease. My blood sugar is elevated but not in the considered diabetic range. I was ready to give up on the medicine until I read the reviews about the thigh. Hopefully these ideas will help someone who reads it.",4,3,4
"Run fast and run FAR away from this drug. I experienced dangerously low numbers which caused me to pass out. Causes delayed Gastric emptying, essentially causing food to back up.  Gas so bad that burps smelled like feces from all the rotting food. After taking it for 1 year I started vomiting all the time. I stopped taking it and the vomiting stopped and back to normal. I would DEFINATELY THINK TWICE BEFORE TAKING THIS MEDICINE! Insulin is safer.",3,1,1
"I have been on the 5mg for one month.  First week some nausea and diarreah then both went away.  Fasting sugar 120 down from 173.  Will go to 10 next week, hope it is not too much, so far so good.",4,4,4
"I started taking this drug three weeks ago and ever since I started it I have had horrific headaches, terrible nausea, alternates  between diarrhea and constipation.  I also have been feeling tired and run down and mood swings.  To those who have posted before, the mood swings do happen. It also can bring on panic attacks. I am going tonight to talk to my doctor about it. I haven't lost a single pound and varying my times for meals and what I eat has not done much at all. I am considered pre diabetic and am wondering if all this hassle is really worth it. I have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. I am considering the holistic approach.  I have sinus infections over the winter time and will need to take antibiotics. From what I have read here it isn't a good mix.",3,1,3
This medication   has  helped  me to  keep  my numbers  where they  should be  and  I've  lost weight from a  size 16 to a  10 and  that's a good thing...,5,5,5
"I was one of the first to be offered Byetta 5mcg and I used it for 3 years.  Twice my doctor upped the amount to the 10mcg - I started vomiting blood - both times.  I am suffering from bloating in my stomach area, pain, cramps, doubled over. I have seen 5 doctors so far with no diagnosis.  It is the area where Byetta was injected.  I have no idea!",3,1,2
I am worried as I have seen many announcements on TV about the dangers of this drug.,4,4,4
"I had some nausea at first but that is subsiding. However, the constant diarrhea is getting me down. I never know when it's going to hit.(Will it ever go away?!) It has decreased my appitite somewhat but I don't know if I've lost any weight yet. But even with the diarrhea it is a much better choice than Humalog. I threw on 40 pounds in a matter of weeks and was constantly hungry. I was eating all the time. If I can weather the awful diarrhea I will stick with it because my numbers are really great, especially in the mornings and I don't have those sudden and frightening drops in sugar level causing the shakes, sweating and hunger any more and I don't feel hungry anymore. Sometimes I have to remind myself to eat a little something. If I had to grade Byetta on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a solid 8.",5,4,5
"I have been on Byetta for a few years now along with Glucovance and Lantus, at first on the 5mcg dose I started experiencing nausea and stomach cramps but continued with the dosage.  I have lost several pounds now since I started the 10mcg dose, the nausea and cramps have gone away and my blood glucose readings and HbA1c have been very good.  Recently my VA Endocrinologist talked me into stoping Byetta because of known pancreatic problems and to increase my Lantus.  So far my numbers have been all over the chart (very high to very low)  Last night I had 2 bouts of lows (49 and 58).  She said there are new side effect factors to Lantus now also.  I want to go back to Byetta and am seriously considering it.",5,5,5
"I have been taking Byetta 10mcg for 90+ days. I have lost 28 pounds and have had mixed results with my bs daily readings they range from 220 50 64 in the same day. I also take amaryl 2 x a day. If i make sure to eat 50 minutes after the injection I don't have any side effects. I have had to adjust considerably my food intake as I cannot eat the quantity of food I used to in a setting, if I do I am miserable. About 15 days ago I started getting red itchy blotches at the injection site. Every injection causes a red itchy blotch and leaves a small scar. No other side effects are occurring with this issue. I have noticed that my immunity is lowered since the introduction of Byetta. I am a person that never gets colds or flu and have had two colds since starting Byetta. The last cold I had before starting Byetta was more than 2 years ago. Other wise I like it. I will get my 1st A1C reading in late July since starting Byetta. Before Byetta it was 7.1.",4,4,4
"First took it a few months ago, but had horrible runny diariaha and made my stomach hurt so bad, I didn't want to eat.  I lost 25 lbs in a month and told my doctor no more.  Tried it one more time, worked okay for about 1 week.  Wasn't hungry and numbers were okay.  Then I broke out in hives all over with swelling from my head to toes.  Should have listened to my body the first time and said NO to the second request from my doctor.  ",2,1,3
"Since I have only taken the 5 dose once and am now on the 10 dose, I'm only going by what has happened so far. My appetite has reduced significantly, but I wasn't necessarily aware that I was eating that much. After these two doses, I have lost 17 pounds. This makes me feel fantastic. I had slight nausea with the 5 dose, but none with the 10. My morning dose seems to affect my noon meal also. I have had to reduce my insulin dosage for meals almost by half and my evening dosage is down 4 units without a hypoglicemic incident during the night. They expect my 1ac to be greatly affected also.",5,5,3
"I have been on this med for 3 wks and have had terrible heartburn & nausea.  My BG has come down, but I wonder if all this heartburn is worth it.  I also take a Nexium q AM, but still have reflux.",5,3,5
"Nausea, and lack of appetite, but that is lessoned if I wait more that an hour after taking the shot. I have lost weight. a1c went from 10 to 7.5 in 3 months.",5,5,5
"Have been on Byetta for 6 months. Worked great except for the nausea, but now within 1/2 hour after taking, my kidneys go on fire. Can't find this in the contraindications.",5,4,4
i have lost 9 pounds in 2 months,5,5,5
This is my third time taking Byetta. Insurance companies suck becuase they would not pay for it. I'm 7 days into it and other than the nausea I feel for a couple hours after taking it I'm good. My BS's have dropped from the 240 range to the 110-120 range. I am on insulin also and have had to reduce my dosage already. Being a nurse I was skeptical about this drug but each time I take it the benefits GAR outweight the side effects. I have never been able to tolerate the 10 mcg dosage so 5 is where I will stay. It also helped me last time (took for 3 months) to take only 1 injection every other day until I ot used to it. I strongly encourage everyone to see and Endocrinologist if your on this med and not just trust your Family doctor. Lab work is essential! Thanks Byetta!,4,4,4
"I have only been taking this medication for 2 weeks.  I lost 6 pounds the first week.  The only side effect I am having is nausea in the evening. My BS are still high, but they are slowly coming down.  I am hopefully this is my answer to lose weight.  Being on insulin for 20 years has but 150 pounds on me.  But I only have 144 to go.  =)",5,5,3

"i have been taking byetta for a month now. i have lost 16lbs, and my bs readings are in the low 100's, awesome, wish i had known about it sooner",5,5,5
"I have been on Byetta for 11 days now. Unlike most, I am not taking it for diabetes. Along with about 3 orther medicines, I am taking it to help balance my hormones and to hopefully loose weight. I have not seen those results yet, but hopefully will. The only result I have seen is not being as tired as I have been for the past few years. I have a lot more energy now! Also, I have not seen the sideffects that others have. I have gotten a little stomach ache once or twice and that is it. No loss of appetite (sadly) or nausea.  I started out taking 5 mg in my leg twice a day, but have found that my arm is easiest and less painful. I was also worried about the fact of inconvinience, but have come to find it is not so inconvient. It's easy to take where ever I go, even work. So far, it seems to be a great product. I am hoping to see results soon! ",5,4,3
BEFORE I STARTED THIS MEDICATION I USED TO WAKE UP WITH LOW BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS--SINCE I STARTED USING THIS MEDICATION THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED AND I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ,5,5,5
love it have lost 75 pd i now have engery to do other things,5,5,5
this is my 2nd day and in one day it has lowered my sugars,4,4,4
"One month into usage, and I am greatly pleased with the levels of my bs.  I only inject once daily, thirty minutes before my largest meal. The nausea is the only real complaint I have but I've learned to deal with it. I do hope it will subside the long I am taking Byetta. My niece was put on it, she lost 75 pounds, got her bs under control so much that she is no longer on ANY meds for bs. She was only on it for seven months total.  ",5,4,5
"This is a God send medicine. I have been taking Metformin 2000 MG, Actose 15 MG, Amaryl 2 MG along with the 5 MCG (twice a day) of Byetta for 3 weeks. I have lost 14 LBS. I do have nausia within 15-30 min of taking the shots but it is mostly managable. I feel much better and my BG is completely controlled for the 1st time since diagnosis in 1999.   My insurance doesn't want to pay for it, but the manufacturer has an assistance program that is helping get me the medicine. Their web address is on the literature that comes with the pen. ",4,5,5
"Have been on the 5mcg dose for almost 1 month and having good results with BG numbers, but the side effects can be rough. The nausea is pretty bad if I don't eat the right foods(breads are a no-no), some dizziness, and I have had some problems with crashing. I read several reviews about taking the injections in the leg, so I'll try that. ",4,3,4
I have been on Byetta a month and I hsve been nauseas every day. I'm going to see about getting off of it.,4,1,3
"I'm just finishing 4 weeks on Byetta 5mcg and will switch to the 10mcg dose in a few days.  Have had no side effects other than the appetite reduction and no nausea.  One month before I started Byetta my doctor increased my Metformin dose from 1000mg to 2000mg.  The increased dosage had absolutely no effect on my BG readings.  Since I started the drug my average BG reading has come down by nearly 30 points.  Since I am prone to skin dryness and dermatitis, I was concerned to read about others experiencing such reactions.  I will be looking to see if there is any problem when I increase my dose.  I have had a small weight loss; I probably would be losing more if I enjoyed eating less than I do.  Based on my early results I am very satisified with the drug and would recommend it to others.",5,5,5
I have been on byetta for one week and have not felt this good for over 9 years.  I read all the reviews prior to my first injection and followed the advice.  I have had no nausea and abdominal distention and bloating went away almost immediately!  I am very happy that my Dr. suggested this drug.,5,5,5
"How can I descride Byetta?. The medicine itself works well, it's the side effects tha is unbearable. I having been taking this medicine almost a month now. But after awhile, I started to get these welts and itchy spots all over my body. I am not 100% sure these symptons are results of the Byetta. The itchy was so bad, I had to get emergency medical assistance. Have any one experienced any allegic reactions to Byetta?  Please let me know. I woukd let to continue but right now I am taking Benadryl and 20mg Perisdone for welts & itching. Please provide some feedback? Thanks,",5,5,5
i lost 20 pounds after starting byetta. this was an enormous benefit to me as it helped me better control my blood pressure and my glucose levels. i take one injection daily of 10 mcg.,5,5,5

AGAIN, ANYONE HAVE ANY MEMORY LOSS",4,2,3
Been using for 3 weeks with no side effects other thatn decreased appetite. That wont hurt since I am way overweight. No problems at all,2,4,4
I have been on byetta for 3 weeks. The only side effect is no appetite. My sugars are controlled much better!,4,4,4
"mildly sick after taking, going to try leg.Worried about internal side efects",3,3,3

"I tried Byetta for six months. I vomited daily for 2 months, was lightheaded, massive headaches, terrible heart burn, lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks now I have PANCREATIC CANCER!!! DONT USE",3,1,3
Took Byetta for 3 months - had to discontinue due to headaches. Saw better BG numbers at first but not consistently low. Took a while for the headaches to go away too once I discontinued it's use. Best of luck to all who try it. Hope it works for you.,4,3,3
"I was prescribed a cocktail of meds to treat type II DM one of them being glucophage (metformin). I was not compliant with this med because of very uncomfortable GI S.E.'s. I was instructed by my MD  to continue taking the med because there was no other med with the same mechanism of action. After changing Doc's and getting an initial office visit HGB A1C at 10.8 the Doc prescribed Byetta 5 mcg twice daily SQ 3 mo. later my HGB A1C was 7.3   WOW!!!!    The initiation of therapy can be difficult to tolerate...I stuck with it because I was told those unsaviory S.E.'s go away....Initially I had to take  other anti hyperglycemics with caution because my BS crashed---I must eat within an hour of injection.  The other SE is Nausea and feeling hypoglycemic I usually had to lye down for 15-20 minutes when the nausea hit.  However that symptom would last al most exactly for 1 hour then go away as fast as it came on ...I opted not to increase to 10 Mcg as suggested right away due to these S.E.'s...I found I started to skip the morning injection and would only take the evening dose and go to bed to sleep through the nausea ( for 2 wks).  This worked great for me because my body became tolerant. ( Literature states nausea lasts through the first month of therpy) Well--this is correct I now can tolerate taking this med morning and night and DO NOT have nausea mixed with feelings of hypoglycemia any longer..But a S.E., I have noticed is Constipation. I have never had had issues with irregularity..Because this med slows down stomach empty-ing I certanly can understand why this happens. So I have to drink more water throughout the day. Stick with it all....it does get better. Having controlled B.S.'s is absolutely neccessary for a life of qaulity.               ",4,5,4

"When i have taken this medication as reccomened for  one thourgh 1.5 weeks I become sick. sometimes i feel that i need to faint (therefore, if the space permits i will lay down and pass out)  other times i feel i can not breath or get enough air. in other situations i feel that queezy in my stomach.  i am considering throwing all of my medication away, because i think it is killing me.",4,2,2
"Hello, Byetta has worked for me, at first a little tired and an unwell feeling, But now after 2 months I am on top of the world, I have lost weight, and my sugar levels are as near to normal as they will ever be, one thing it has made me eat more sensible, better than a gastric band lol  Thank you Alan Beaton, South Wales  UK.

"I have been on Byetta for one week now, and since then, I have had very little side effects, but I've notice that instead of the weight loss, I've actually gained about 6lbs since starting the medication and I work out 3-4times a week, and constipation aswell. Has anyone had similar problems?",4,2,1
My husband takes the injection one hour after his evening meal then goes right to bed. He seems fine for the first hour then falls into a very deep sleep. After about half an hour he often violently vomits a couple of times bringing up blood and clotting material along with the usual. After that he falls into a sleep that seems more like a semi-coma to me during which time he will answer questions but he doesn't make a bit of sense. For a while I thought he was faking with the heavy breathing and dramatic body lauguage. It is  frightening.  He won't talk frankly with his doctor or let me go in with him. With the hippe law I can't talk to the doctor myself. I want him to find a specialist but he refuses. Is his life in danger?,2,1,3
"I wrote a review on Byetta  several months ago and stated that it greatly helped my type 2 and I had lost some weight. To Date, I have found that in the little amount of time I have used it, I now have pancreatic issues from the Byetta and it is quite painful!! I have since stopped using the drug and would strongly recommend that users that have used if for longer then 6 months get blood work to check for problems.

I have experienced weight loss and have much better control over my blood sugars.  I also have hypothyroidism and have found that I cannot take Byetta at the same time as I take the thyroid medication because it seems to affect how my body uses the thyroid medication.  I now take my thyroid medication, wait an hour then take the Byetta, wait 30 min then eat breakfast.  It seem like a difficult schedule but it has actually been easy and I feel great. ",5,5,5
no problems and i am not on insulin..,5,4,4
ive been in this 4 days and so far ive noticed a weight loss & loss of appetite.  i hate shots but find to get the benefit from this i am going to do it.  i get a metal like taste from it and find a mint helps and occasional upset stomach from time to time but nothing at all to keep me from staying on Byetta.  my only concern is internal damage which the dr will keep an eye on.  i pray this is my answer and wish everyone luck with their progress!!,4,4,4

"When I started on 5mcg twice daily, I got increasingly sick to my stomach, and after 2 week the constant nausea was debilitating.  Reading WebMD salvaged this for me.  50% of the first 50 comments reviewed indicated having mild to very severe stomach problems.  Two indicated using the leg instead of stomach had solved the problem for them.  I tried it.  It worked for me!  If you have nausea, try putting it in your leg for two days and see if it makes a difference for you.  Blood Glucose is improving significantly.",4,4,4
sharp cramps in stomach,3,2,3
"I have been on this drug for 7 months.I started with 5mg for 1 month, then was changed to 10mg. My sugar often dropped,(hypoglycemic)sometimes down to 32. I was then forcing coke and glucose tablets. Aside from the nausea, I was vomitting quite often. I finally couldn't take it anymore so, dropped the Byetta altogether. My Dr. upped the Janumet from 50/500 to 50/1000. My bg was remaining high. I am now on the 5mg dosage of Byetta hoping to prevent the high bg, vomitting and hypoglycemia. Tonight after eating a portion of red beans, brown rice and regular ice cream, my bg is 77.I just ate a piece of fruit because I'm afraid it will drop. How can you loose weight eating to accommodate the medication? Any suggestions? Thanks.",3,3,5
"I haven't experienced nausea but I have been getting welts on my legs and thighs wherever I inject myself.  This condition is itchy.  My doctor says it's an alergic reaction, with no remedy to relieve it.  Other than that, I've lost weight and have no other reaction.  Has anyone had this reaction?",4,3,4
I can use the blood sugars that are in my system and I don't tire near as much as before.  I also lost 58 pounds but it was very hard at first but well worth it.,3,4,5
I was Prescribed Byetta in addition to lantus insulin for type 1.5(LADA). Have found it to help- but felt sick to my stomach most of the time- have only been on it for 3 weeks.,5,5,5
I was on Byetta for over a year and then started to have severe stomasch pain. I was told to contio=ue with the Byetta within 3 weeks went int hospitsal thaught having heart attack. they went in an looked everything fine with the heart. Then they did a upper GI and found that my GERD was severe and everthing was irriated. They took me off of the byetta nad the stamach apin went away but still having real blood sugar problems.,4,2,4
"I am so thankful for the reviews on this website.  I had nausea after the second and third dose.  It was very bad.  I found through the reviews that injecting the medication into the thigh would relieve the nausea.  After the first injection in my thigh the nausea stopped.  I have always been a late night snacker and this medicine has reduced by appetite after dinner by 95%.  I have been taking the medication for about 3 weeks, my testing results have lower a great deal.",4,4,4
this is the third day of this med regiment for me,4,4,4
"I have been on byetta for 4months and still have some nausea associated with it, also I have had the red rash at the injection site it has gotten better later. I've lost 7 lbs and that is a plus, but I have alot of tenderness in my right upper stomach area below my right breast(anyone else have this problem?)",4,3,3
"I started with Byetta 5mcg a little over 3 years ago.  After 1 month I went to 10 mcg.  The first 2 - 3 weeks I had nausea and then it subsided completely after about a month.  Once in a while I will get a slight nausea feeling, but it only lasts for a couple of minutes.  Over the next year I lost 50 lbs and it has stayed off since that time.  I continue to take Byetta 10 mcg and do not take any other oral medications for my diabetes. If I do not eat enough I have had some low BG reading, but overall it has been a very good drug for me.  All of my blood and organ function tests have been good so far. ",5,5,5
effectiveness generally very good but sort of sporadic - consistency of delivery from syringe?  Stability of drug for >30 days?,2,5,4
"My A1c was 7.4 even though I was following the diabetic diet, exercising, 1000 mg Metformin 2x daily as well as 10 mg gliburide 2x daily. Fasting BG hung around 180. Started with the 5mcg pen and immediately I had to start cutting back on the amount of gliburide (reduced to 5 mg 2x daily). Nausea was bad at times but no vomiting. When I started the 2nd pen I got welps for about a week but applying benadryl cream to the injection site helped. Also, waiting an extra 5-10 seconds before removing the needle as well as turning it a quarter turn to be sure to remove all the liquid underneath the skin help.  BG fasting was averaging around 85 when I got the flu shot. Within 4 days BG started moving up towards 150-160. I called the doc and he said to just keep taking and bumped me up to the 10 mcg. It took nearly a month for the BG to start making its way back down (also had to go back to the 10 mg of Gliburide 2x daily). The average now is about 128 for fasting with an average of 117 2 hours after meals.  I really think the 5 mcg pen worked better than the 10 mcg as my liver still dumps tremendous amounts of sugar into my blood (dawn syndrome) on the 10 mcg. I know this because dr. only perscribed 1 pen of 10mcg to see if I could tolerate it. Once it was done and I was waiting for my appointment I used the refill on the 5 mcg until I saw him. He thinks it's just coincidence but I'm going to go to an endocrinologist for a 2nd opinion.  Increasing water and fiber helped with the consitipation issues. I only have nausea if I wait longer than 30 min between injection and meal.",5,3,4
Keep a eye on your Pancreas. I almost died from using Byetta.,3,1,3
"I started Byetta 10mcg and after about 3 months found it to be too much, bad side effects and causing crashes, sick stomach and headaches. I lost about 30 lbs on it but couldn't handle the effects so I went to 5mcg which works very well. The more weight I lost, the less byetta I needed. I don't use any other diabetic meds with Byetta and it doesn't seem to make a difference. I am concerned about the issue of damage to internal parts though. I'm hoping that losing another 15-20 lbs that I won't need the byetta at all.",4,3,4
After being on Byetta for over 2 years. I suffered an acute Pancreatic attack. near death experience. I have been removed from the drug. I have controlled my glucose levels by Diet and the other medications I have been on so far. sugars,5,2,3
"After being quite ill, my A1c went up to 9.4 -- within two months of being on 5mcg of Byetta, it was down to 5.7.  Never had any real GI sympptoms except for decreased appetite.  Lost about 60lbs.  I  LOVE  it!!!",5,5,5
"While it held my blood sugar count in check, the side effects of welts and rash forced me to abandon use.  Manufacturer denies such side effect.",5,1,4
"I have had minimial nasaeu with the drug.  However, since I started about 2 months ago I have had numbness in my toes since I have been on the drug (almost immediately after starting with Byetta).",4,3,3

I feel so much better and I don't have much of an appetite.  I still get nauseous every once in a while.  However, the benefits outweigh the side effects.",5,4,5
"At first,I had some stomache upset,and diarrhea.Now I have lost 10 lbs.in one month of usage I am excited!!!Maybe this will be an answer to my prayers,I am only on the 5mg for now I go back to the Dr. on Dec.8 hopefully there is more good news like a lower a1c.",4,5,5
"I have been taking Byetta for about 6 months, I have gained weight and all I do is vomit (about 3-6 times a week on average) I have told my endocrinologist about this but he told me to continue taking Byetta in hopes things would improve. I feel sick and miserable all the time. Has anyone had a similar experience? Please Help.",5,2,3

Just started Byetta dont feel sick to my stomach but then again this is only my second day,5,5,5
"I have been on the med for 6 months and have lost 32 pounds.  However, I have recurrent problems with a really vile taste in my mouth, particularly right after the injection.  Has this ever happened to anyone else?  I cannot seem to get a straight answer on this from the company.  It is so bad at times I feel I am going to vomit.  Any ideas?",5,4,5
"I have used Byetta for one month. I was taken off of the med today by my endocrinologist. The first three weeks I had severe upset stomachs after most shots. Although that did subside with week four, I now have developed red raised bumps at all of my injections sites. I went to my Dr. and they suggested to use the longer needles. I tried it , but it has not worked. The bumps are very itchy. The medicine worked great for me though. My numbers were right were they needed to be. I hope other users read this if they need encouragement. this med works great in lowering your sugars. Just stick with it through the stomach aches, they do go away after time. I wish I could of stayed on this med. I now have to take insulin. It makes me sad. ",4,2,5
lost 40lbs blood sugar stays around 100. makes me sick to my stomach.,4,4,5
THIS IS MY FIRST  WEEK OF USING BYETTA. I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS EFFECTIVE YET.,3,3,3
"I've only been on this medication for three weeks, but I haven't had any side effects and so far, my blood sugar readings have greatly improved",5,5,5
"I have never had any problems with this drug nor any side effects at all. I also take 1000mg Metformin twice a day and watch my diet very carefully and get at least 1hr of walking in a day.  I have been taking it for 6 months now and have lost 60lbs and have brought my A1C down from 10.1 to 5.9.  So far, so good.",5,5,5
"First let me say thanks to all whom have posted on this website. Knowledge is key. I started Byetta 5mcg twice a day for over two weeks. I already prepared my mind and body for the vomiting and the nausea. The information I received from others was very helpful. For example: Injecting on the thigh can alleviate the side effects and it did. I have not vomited or have experienced nauseous for two weeks. I did have constipation and because of it had stomach cramps but they have subsided. I kept my same diet (not really healthy) but my appetite has gone down and I don't crave late night snacks. Overall in two weeks I have lost 5 pounds. Everybody is different I do recommend Byetta, if your doctor suggests it. Don’t just try it for a few days and quit. About injecting yourself: it hurts more pricking your finger than injecting. Thanks to all Stay healthy. I'll try to keep an update after a month          ",5,5,5
"Byetta helped me alot. But I can not continue to us it because of the price,my insurance will not pay for it.",5,5,4
"As far as it lowering my sugar it is wonderfull. I lost 40lbs in just 4 months. The first few months were bad because it makes you very nauseated, vomiting. even now after 1 year I still get sick on my stomach alot. Now I'm noticing I get alot of severe gas and burping. 3 different times I had gas so bad that my burps smelled worse then farts. I did'nt take the byetta for 2 days then it cleared up. this is my only concern right now. But I can eat most anything I want. I'm just cant eat as much as I used to and thats a good thing !!!",5,3,5
My nausea and reduced appetite have gotten increasingly stronger over the 5 months I have been on it. Any weight loss was nullified by the need for more insulin because I wasn't eating enough. It finally got to be too much.  ,5,2,3
I'VE BEEN TAKING BYETTA FOR 5 MONTHS. A LTTLE BIT OF NAUSSEA AT THE BEGINING. I STARTED WITH AN A1C OF 13 ( YES 13 ) AND NOW 7.O MY BS #S ARE AROUND 110. I'M VERY SATISFIED. THE ONLY THING IS THAT I HAVE NOT LOOSE ANY WEIGHT. I REALLY RECOMMENDED,4,4,4
"My sugars were in good control with byetta, and lost 30 pounds in about three months,but when the FDA came out with a caution for patients that have pancreatitis my doctor took me off of it for precaution",4,4,4
Have been taking it for 3 months and still the nausea is overwhelming.  Have tried different timing of shot/eating and get no relief.  MD says give it another month.  Have lost 12lbs; bld sugar steady at 124...but I'm not sure (at age 82) its worth the nausea.,4,2,4
 I was sick for a long time on this in the mornings.  New doc said to wait about 30-40 mins. then eat.  That has helped greatly.  ,3,3,4
I was on Byetta & then heard of the problems people have had with Pancreatitis so I stopped. Started again & noticed that I was totally emotional. I went from depression to anger to yelling in no time flat. Anyone else have this problem? I don't think my family will survive this!,2,2,2
"I have been on Byetta 4 months, lost 18 lbs, dropped my a1c from 7.8 to 6.5, dropped my BP to normal range. Experienced some nausea, but now it is rare. I agree that eating smaller portions and balanced diet is the key to contolling the nausea. I also belong to Curves and workout at least 3 times a week. Taking Mylanta helped me thru the nausea and also with constipation. I now eat Activia yogurt everyday and make sure I eat fiber in my diet. I am feeling great! I am 52 and have been overweight my whole life. Diagnosed with diabetes in March 08. I feel I can control both my health issues and weight with this drug. ",5,5,5
Very sick to my stomach,5,2,2
I started with 5mcg almost 2 months ago.  I've lost 10 lbs but I think that's just because I'm alway nausous.  The Dr moved me to 10mcg yesterday and both times I used it I vomited.  I'm not sure I can keep using this me.,3,1,3
"After being diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my weight ""skyrocket"" from meds to treat/control pcos.  Developed type 2 diabetes from excessive weight.  Sugar levels very high.....now using combo byetta/metformin for 3 months now, lost 27 pounds, hormone/vitamin/sugar levels are improving.  My cycle is regular and I feel all around better.  The first month was very difficult for me; morning sickness like symptoms, headaches, bloating, gas, diarrhea, heartburn...sounds fun huh?  By the 5th week all began to subside and now I have no reaction from this med.  Word to the wise:  YOU MUST WATCH WHAT YOU EAT!!!  SUGARY FOODS, WHITE STARCHY FOODS, ALCOHOL AND ALL TYPES OF CANDY/SWEETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL YUCKY!!!!!  If you are not allergic to this med and are very serious about a healthier lifestyle (not just a quick fix)  talk to your doctor about this product.  ",4,5,5
"Well, who likes shots?  Expected the worst.  Little tummy upset and trouble with constipation.  Between the shots and my new ""focus"" on diabetes I was able to lower my A1c from 9.3 to 5.5.  Byetta helped curb my appetite. Got behind trying to drop weight with it's help.  Dropped from a very fat #340 to a still very rotund #294 in six months and still losing.  It's no magic bullet.  When I started it in March I did it with only small expectations for weight loss, but wanted to bring my bs down.  Insulin would only make me fatter.  Took Avandia and later Actos.  I definitely think these are not good for anybody.  Give it a try. It works. ",4,5,5
I keep on throwing up after taking this medication.  I had to stop taking it.,5,1,4
I have and continue to experience severe stomach cramps with nausea. constipation and explosive uncontrolled bowel movements I would just rather use insulin,3,1,3
I STAY SICK ALL THE TIME,1,1,1
Only been using it for two weeks. Great  control for hungar. Also sugar levels dropped extremly. Very little sickness. This stuff is great.,5,5,5
the nausea is overwhelming at times and i do tend to bruise round the injection site but overall im pleased with it especially the weight loss.,5,5,4
"I have not suffered any of the usual side-effects listed.  I have lost 12 pounds in 3 months, but beginning about week 2 while on 10 mcg dosage I have had increasing insomnia.  This is not one of the normal side effects, so I continued taking Byetta for nearly 4 months. Initially I found no mention of insomnia as a side effect.  Doing a more thorough GOOGLE search, I have found at least one other patient mentioning he started getting no more than 3 hrs sleep per night after starting the 10mcg dosage.  Ambien and Lunesta do not work to get me to sleep.  Will discontinue Byetta immediately.",3,1,3

"I had some nausea with 5mcg but the nausea was unbelievable with 10mcg until I discovered giving it in my thigh.  Now, I have no nausea, still have some burping, but feel so much better.  Haven't lost any more weight.  ",3,3,4
"I have been on this medication for 2 months, developed a raised bump at injection site.  I asked dr if normal side effect as I can not see it documented anywhere and he said that is un-usual.  no other rashes . was told to take claritin to see if it helps.  now I sometimes get the raised red bump at injection site here and there.  some nausea. sometimes bad heartburn.     my question : has anyone using byetta had this problem and if so what did you do, or what were you told to do. ",3,2,3
"I am on my 3rd month of byetta.  The 1st three wks on 5mcg were bad. Nausea & diarrhea. 4th wk side effects started to subside. Then I got headaches.  Not too bad & by wk 6 those were gone. Wk 9, I began 10mcg. Worse than any morning sickness I ever had & I vomit a lot.  Now at wk 11.  Have found taking pepto about 20 min before injection helps the nausea.  Still have diarrhea.  The good news is...my bs is now w/in normal range & I have lost 12 pounds.  Doc says to hang in there, side effects should subside soon. I have a lot of health issues & take several other meds.  I have learned to take my other meds 1 hr before or after injection,if not, I throw them up. For me, the side effects are horrid...but it's worth it to get my sugars under control. Added bonus if I drop some lbs too.",5,4,5
I have taken this for one year now. I never had any nausea with it. I have lost 70 pounds since starting it. I feel so much better and have more energy. I'm not hungry like I was before.,5,5,5
"severe headaches, nausea, all foods lost their original flavors. No longer enjoyed my morning coffee which I have been drinking since I was a teenager, now in 50's. Discontinued use within weeks all above symptoms gone. However sugars are back to being high again.",3,1,3
"This is day 17 on Byetta and I have almost no appetite, had no upset stomach to speak of and love the fact that I've discarded prandin, cut my Avandia in half and will soon discard that and 1/2 the metformin.  I've been type 2 for more than 30 years.  My daughter is a physician and says ""You'll never lose weight on those pills.  We give them to people and tell them to go lose weight. It's not going to happen.""  My overweight friend was diagnosed a year and a half ago and put on the usual pill combo and gained 25 lbs. the first month.  Then her dr. prescribed Byetta.  Over the last year she's lost 50 lbs without any change in her behavior and no increase in exercise.  I can't wait to go on 10mcg a day and will put up with whatever the side effects are in exchange for NO appetite and the subsequent weight loss.  I'm the only fattie in my family and have been miserable about it for 40 years.  Reading all these testimonials has given me a boost.  Thanks!",5,5,4
"I started the Byetta almost 2 weeks ago. I am still struggling with Slight Nasuea. But have been able to control it by staying hydrated and eating slowly. I am loving this product so far. My Doc put me on it because of problems stemming from HypoThyroidism. I don't need a ""nap time"" anymore. and I have tons more energy in the evening. I have had a little bit of Heartburn, and about 2 hours after I eat i get a hot flash. But they are starting to subside. I have paired taking the Byetta with a carb concious diet. The no-carb diets have always been REALLY hard for me. But since taking the Byetta it has been so much easier.  My only draw back is having to pack it with me every time I travel, go out to eat or eating at a friend or family members house. I was told to keep it Refigerated all the time, so it is somewhat of a hassel. But so far is proving worthy of the extra effort. (as long as I don't forget it.)",4,5,4
I've been taking Byetta for about 3 mos now. I've lost 45 pounds since I started it. Nausea was bad at first but it did subside but I still do get nauseous when I eat too much. Noticed that's a problem on here. Also heard that if you don't eat the right kid of foods you will get nauseous which means no fried food or junk food.  Was taking Byetta for two months then Insurance wouldn't let me have it so doc put me on Metformin.  Had bad reaction on metformin-tremors in hands and slow hand reaction time. When I was diagnosed a1c was 5.36 and is still in the normal range. Glucose Tolerance testing is how I was diagnosed when my bs went above 200 twice so doc says I'm diabetic. Really give this stuff a chance as I think it works great!!!!!,5,5,5
"I love byetta, I have energy now around 3pm I was exhausted and needed a nap but I work all day so that isn't an option. I started byetta a week ago and my appetite is supressed, I have energy to do thing, I experence a little nausa in the morning but not with my second does. My Gluclose #'s are significately lower then they were..they are now in Normal range. I was ranging aroun 224-336... now I am at 114 I take the byetta in conjunction with metformin and it working for me. I was alittle nervous about injecting myself with anything but I have over come my fear of needles I think...BYETTA is Fabulous! No complaints. ",5,5,4
"I began Byetta 5mcg four days ago. I am  your typical resistant bullheaded diabetic -I was absolutely mortified with the thought of needles, scared sick of getting sick, and in complete denial that my blood sugar was out of control. Over ten years I had been given every opportunity to control it with diet, exercise and multiple variations of oral meds. It worked for a time - but unfortunately as all good things come to an end when I hit my 40's - they didn't work any longer and I kept kicking myself for not exercising or eating right. I very reluctantly, still whining and crying and yes - pouting some too -  agreed to give Byetta a try and WOW!That is all I can say and I'm a very wordy person as you can tell. I started my shot on Sunday morning with a BS of 403. Two hours after breakfast I was down to a BS of 286 and my nightly BS was 157. They had said you should see immediate results and boy were they right! And here is the kicker - I have not been sick or nauseated one single time - I credit this to my doctor who told me to eat smaller meals at first and to limit my carbs while getting used to the medicine. I already feel better and as much as I was told and didn't believe them - the finger pricks do hurt more than the shots, because the shots don't hurt at all! It took me a full 15 minutes psyching myself up for the first one and I couldn't believe it when I finally took it. The only inconvenience to this medicine is the timing of the shot with your meals and a little bit of heartburn at times. I am having BS's in the 150 to 250 range now and I'm sure I'll be upped to 10mcg at the end of my trial month and I'll start worrying all over again. But for now I am thrilled and thankful for this amazing drug. I hope this review will help you in your decision, because I read and re-read all 99 reviews on here when I knew I was going to be prescribed it. I wish good health and the best of luck to all of you who may read this.      ",3,4,5
my blood sugar levels are very high but i have lost a lot of weight,5,5,5
"After btarting insulin, I gained a lot of weight! I was very depressed, and tried EVERYTHING to get it off. My very condescending doctor kept calling me ""fat"" and just kept upping the insulin intake.  I changed doctors, and he immediately took me off of insulin and started me on Byetta. I must say, I definately DO NOT have an appetite and have lost a lot of weight, but I am not sure that not eating is the answer either. I am wondering if I will get some of my appetite back with time? Does anybody know? The one downfall has been the nausea, however the doc says that will get better with time also. ",5,4,4

Everyone is diffrent, but Byetta has really helped me!  ",5,5,5
" I started this at 5 mg and had serious nausea for about 8 days (to the point of not being able to stick my toothbrush in my mouth - let alone food). Sugars continued to go up and up. Called doctor at 7 days and he asked that I continue for a bit longer. At 12 days I noticed about 6-8 mosquito like bright red circles at various injection sites. Told the doctor about the burning when I inject it, showed him the reactions, showed him the log. Oh and didn't lose a darn pound. I am now off byetta, and to my mind, allergic to it. I mean how else can you explain it? I had hives and itching where I've injected. This is a terrible product. ",1,1,1

I do not have stones or blockages, and doctor thinks it's hepatitis.  I'll have biopsy monday to determine if viral or medication related.... but isn't it strange that every one here who has tried the 10 ml has the EXACT same symptoms as hepatitis?  If you are suffering side effects and have not had your liver/pancreas functions tested, DO IT!",4,3,3

Doc told me to stop metformin and just use the byetta.  Have experienced very minimal nausea, light headaches, swelling of hands and ankles but serious constipation. Seems like I go every 5 days, feel awful that I for the 1st time will take a laxative, hope it works.  5mcg works for BG's that I'm scared of starting the 10mcg.  I think 10mcg will be too much cause with the 5 I have experienced low blood sugars (57) and I feel like if I'm going to pass out.  I'm looking forward to weightloss if it happens cause its tough trying even when I walk alot, 3 miles a day every day.  This Med is ok for now, I just hope it work for the long haul.",5,3,5
"I feel watching what type of foods i eat and walking has helped. Looking forward to my next A1C....I am 58 and hoping that this will help me for the rest of my life. Ski Syracuse,utah",5,4,4
"I have experienced loe blood sugars with byetta.Now my dr. has reduced my injection dosage to 5mg. 2 x daily , plus 500mg. of metaformin 2 x daily.",4,3,3
it has been a upsetting on it makes me sick to my stomach and nauseus,5,3,5
"I like it, it works good",5,5,5
Just about an hour after I have used Byetta I get an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach.It lasts for quite a few hours. I almost feel sick to my stomach. I also have an hiatal hernia.,4,2,4
"I took this for the treatment of Diabetes Type 2 management and for obesity, and it made me really sick to my stomach at first but did very well at controlling my appetite!",4,4,5
"I have been taking this for 3 months. While I was on 5mg 2x daily, it didn't affect my blood sugar, but I did feel like I ate less food. Dr. changed to 10 mg 2xdaily, and now I feel ill and tired all the time, with dizziness in the mornings.  I am not as pleased with the treatment as the best treatment for diabetes.  ",5,3,3
"Getting the nausea feeling is ruff.feeling somewhat larthargic,small loss of weightblood sugar around 120-140 w metformin will discuss options with doctor",3,3,4
"I started on Byetta 3wks ago and with 5mg. and have noticed a drop in bs and the nausea went away, but I'm noticing a slight swelling of my hands and face, also some headaches have been occuring. Anybody else experience any of these symptoms? I really like how this medicine has lowered my bs when nothing else seemed to work and would hate having to get off of it.",4,3,4
it worked really well in the beginning then i got really sick for a month and it hasnt worked since,4,1,1
"What a great drug! I had a predisposition for weight-related Type 2 diabetes. In 1987 i started gaining 20 pounds per month so went to doc who checked my thyroid function and then misread it (always get copies of your bloodwork!!), telling me it was normal. Over the next 7 years I gained about 140 pounds and Type 2 diabetes along with Restless Leg Syndrome. After getting my thyroid under control, I started on other meds such as Avandia, which nearly killed me via fluid retention in chest/heart cavities. In the end I was on Metformin (2000 mg daily) and glipizide (5 mg). When these weren't enough, my endocrinologist gave me a choice of insulin or byetta. I chose the byetta and am I glad I did! Have been on it since Nov. '07 and have lost over 45 pounds. Since all this weight loss and blood sugars staying normal, I have been having low blood sugar episodes down in the 40's and 50's. Solid food will not bring it back up quickly because of the slowed digestion process, so must resort to sugar drinks or apple juice. The low blood sugar episodes happen fairly quickly after an injection. It may be time to cut back on other diabetes meds. Endocrinologist fully expects the diabetes and borderline high blood pressure to disappear with enough weight loss. I had some light nausea when first starting, but it went away quickly. Docs advise eating only when hungry and have lost the weight w/o even trying. It does make you feel bloated after eating due to the slowed digestion and feeling fuller longer, but this is acceptable for the benefits achieved. My HbA1c has dropped from 8 to 6.1 in feb.'s check. I have no injection pain due to a numb spot on my stomach from a tubal ligation, just some redness and occassionally a minor skin tear from the very fine needle and not holding it completely still. I do agree with a previous reviewer...every pen seems to be different. One pen was so hard to push I got a lot of skin tears. I love this stuff and can't say enough good things about it!!!",4,5,5
"Have been on this drug for 14 months and have lost 40lbs.  My Alc is now 5.9.  Still haven't been able to eat some foods as they make me sick just by smell and taste.  Still get slightly nauseated every evening almost, but I am very pleased with  this drug.  Had to buy new clothes.",5,5,5
"Started with A1C of 7.5,after 9 months am down to 4.8. I also started at 425 lbs and am now at 372. 53 lbs lost in 9 months so I can't complain. Some nausea after injecting but I found when I ate slower and smaller amounts that I didn't have the sick feeling as much. For me, the nausea, vomiting, etc. was really about how healthy I was eating while taking Byetta. In my opinion, you CAN NOT take Byetta and continue to eat like you did before--when you do, that's when you get the side effects. ",4,5,5
.Lost 45 lbs. blood sugar more stable. the one problem that does bother me is the sometimes severe nausea and vomiting.,5,5,5
"Although my sugars are great and the fatigue I experienced with Actos is gone, I am totally constipated! After taking the 5 mg for two weeks, I just stopped going. (Before that, I was fine; a cup of coffee could get me going.) Now, after Exlax, MOM, a Fleets 3 kit and a trip 4 days ago to the ER where they tried a saline lax, molasses enema and a Rx for Miralax, I'm still waiting and feeling scared. My doc says stay on the Byetta, but I am afraid every shot is just bringing me closer to my colon rupturing. What now? ",5,4,4
"I just started 10 mgs of it.  seems to be doing its job but not seeing the number yet. little higher than before.  has cut down on my appetite though.  haven't really felt too sick to my stomach, slight acid reflux.  hope it will do it thing for me.",4,4,3
I love the results from the use of Byetta.  I have used it for over 12 months.  My A1C and blood sugar control has been amazing.  The ability to help reduce my appetite is an added bonus.  I would highly recommend Byetta.  My only caution is that the first day on a new pen may cause some minor stomach irritation.  Not worth stopping use of this miracle drug.  I am wondering about any long term side effects.    ,5,5,5
"I've been on the meds for 4 days . . . the nausea is becoming less, I'm eating less and not feeling hungry.  My blood sugar has dropped, but not quite enough yet.  I look forward to better results as time goes on.",5,4,4
DX with Type 2 diabetes.  On Byetta for 16 month.  Just got off it due to low blood sugar readings as low as 47.  I work out at the gym 7 days a week and think my sugars are normal at this point due to exercise and diet.  Liked what Byetta did for me but low blood sugar readings were a bit to much for me.  Can't live that way afraid to go out or drive.  Talked with my Doctor and was taken off it due to low blood sugar readings.  Be aware of being tired and check your blood sugar when you feel like that it could be dangerous.,5,4,5
"I have only used this product for a couple of weeks have not experienes nausea, but the firs couple of days was constantly thirsty and experienced diarea,and a little blurred vision has improved the sugar level greatly dropped from high 400's to 130-170 range have a follow up appt. on the 23rd of April. overall I am satisfied with this product and will continue to use it...",4,5,5
"In 11 months, I have lost 22 pounds.  I always thought I was neuasous when I took Byetta, but I think it was just that I was no longer hungry!  Then my creatinine went up and my DR. thought it was time for me to go on Insulin.  In 10 days, I gained 6 pounds.  Boy, Do I miss my Byetta now!!!",5,5,5
"Nausea was absolutely horrific for the first 3-4 months.  Then it disappeared, and now, I feel great.  BS control is good. Before meals, 90-110 and 2 hours or so afterwards, 120-150.  I am worried about tingling in my hands.  Could this be the onset of dm induced neurapathy, even tho my numbers have so improved?  I have lost 16 lbs and have about 25-30 to go.",5,5,5
"After almost three years of usage I am starting to have trouble with the actual ""pen"" usage. The knob at the end does not want to turn and have had to resort to using a pair of pliers to turn it. The pharmist is of no help and when I called the company they tried to make out that I was a dummy and didn't know what I was doing. I also think that the drug's effectiveness has started to wear off also from long time usage.",1,2,3
"I cant remember any drug making me sicker. I have tried 5 times to take this and evertime I get so weak and lethargic and it does not help with bg, wt loss, or anything. The Dr. said it is made from lizard spit? Maybe I am allergic to it. The drug co. is not honest with true side effects either. I would not reccoment this to anyone with gastroparesia either. Just awful.",1,1,1
"I have been on Byetta for over 3 months.  I have found it be very effective in conjunction with my metformin.  I have experienced minimual weight loss as a side effect.  The nausea seems to effect me worse in the evenings than in the mornings, but usually only is moderate or mild.  I believe it is definitely a step in the right direction for me and look forward to the oral alternative that my doctor reported to be coming out later.    Good luck to all!",4,5,5
"I've only been on Byetta for 4 days and I already love.My nausea was very limited and the weakness minamial.I'm just waiting now for the weight loss!Thjese reviews did help me.So will let you know later about my progress.Was started on this drug because Metformin caused so many GI problems,the diarrhea and bloating taking twice daily now only once a day. ",5,5,5
On byetta a little less than a month.I get pretty nausiated after each injection. Before Byetta my numbers were high (as high as 500). Now at times they drop into the 40's and still at times the numbers are up as high as 200.Has anyone found any help for the sick feeling?? How long does it last??  ,5,3,5
I had an allergic reaction to this medication. I broke out in a skin rash. I took the medication for two seperate treatments and the skin rash only got worse with each treatment. I did lose 5 lbs on the med.,3,1,4
"I've only used Byetta 5mg for one week. Nausea is managable. It is a relief to not feel hungry. But I'm experiencing significant weakness, exhaustion and mental confusion that lasts 5-6 hours.  Anyone else deal with this?  Blood sugars are great. I want to stay on this medicine and am upset that my exhaustion and confusion may make using this drug impossible.",5,1,3
it has helped with urine control,4,4,4
"I like this treatment option. I have type 1 diabetes, and this helps me with my numbers better than Insulin does, it oes not have the side effects of low blood sugar as often. The only thing that sucks about it, is that from a guys standpoint, you get very hormonal, and have weird cravings for things. Also, you can get pretty bad morning sickness, its like being pregnant!! But overall, this medicine is a great medicine, just with some weird side effects.",5,4,5
unlike others i do not has DM i have insulin Ressence and PCOS (poly cystic ovaries)Because I have insulin ress i create a higher insulin level as wher diabetic has a high glucose level.  It is off lable for my condition but drs gave it a try and it is workig great.  I am a nuse as well so I see a lot of great feed back,5,5,5
I experience diarrthea and itching on my body. Wht can be done for this?,4,3,4
I've been diabetic for 15 years and A1C was over 9.  I been taking Byetta for a little over two years.  I can't say enough good things about it.  At first I had all the normal symptoms but they went away and I lost about 46 lbs and have kept it off for well over a year now.  A1Cs have been great - between 5 and 6.  Don't plan to ever give it up!,4,5,5
"I have been on this medication for six weeks, and my blood sugar levels have certainly dropped.  They are now usually in a normal range.  However, after the evening injection I usually really suffer with stomach upset for 5 to 6 hours.",3,2,3
"Have been on byetta for 1 week.  Feel great, felt awful before.  Have already started losing weight. Dr. wanted to try to get bllod sugars under control before trying insulin.  Miracle Drug Definately...",5,5,5
I was taking 5mg and felt great.  Got lazy and stopped.  I am bak and on 10mg and feel great.  This drug ia a miracle for me.,5,4,4
This drug worked very well however I had to go off of it after 1 month. I started to get hives at the injection sites and take benadryll. My doctor stated that there was going to be an oral alternative and still waiting. I had good numbers and lost weight. Excellent drug despite the itch.,5,5,5
"I experienced nausea at first with the 5 mcg dose and then it subsided. When I went to the 10mcg dose I got very nauseous and constipated. I was not hungry, which was good, but i finally cut back to one dose before dinner and then stopped using it all together. Felt so bad after eating even a light meal. I am going to try going back to 5 mcg twice a day as I seemed to tolerated that pretty well. I definately liked the fact that it cut down on my appetite dramatically.",4,2,5
nausea everytime i take it and it last the whole day,3,5,1
"I have been on Byetta for 6 weeks, lost 14lbs, had nausea in the beginning. I am not Type II but headed there and my doctor let me use Byetta to control my appetite and blood sugars, preventative medicine!!!!",4,4,4
I was diagnosed with type II diabetes in 2005.  My blood sugars went as high as 600 and we could not get control with oral meds.  I was placed on Lantus injections which helped me control my blood sugars for a couple of years and my A1C went from 10 to 4.  Then my blood sugars started rising again and my A1C went back up to 8 and I've been on Byetta along with my Lantus for the past month.  I go for my follow up visit at the end of week and am anxious to see if there has been any weight loss. My blood sugars have drastically reduced.  My fasting is never over 120 and my post meal is never over 180.  I'm loving the control I feel.  I experienced very mild nausea and still sometimes get dizziness or what feels like an inner ear issue but other than that I have tolerated the drug very well and am very pleased with the outcome thus far.,4,5,5
Only started with this in December 2007. Have some swings of blood sugars going low with exercise.,4,3,2
"Since I'm relatively young to have type 2 diabetes, my Dr insisted on an aggressive treatment. After having an a1C of 6.1 for the last year she decided to put me on Byetta. I just increased from the 5mcg to 10 mcg dosage after my first month, but everything is going great.  I am losing about a pound a week, due to my appetite being suppressed.  My blood-sugar readings have been in the 80's & 90's! I haven't had any of the side effects mentioned, although as a previous user mentioned it seems to have affected my menstrual cycle.  We'll see how things go.  Overall, this is a great answer to my hopefully temporary issue.",5,5,5
at first I lost 30 lbs using byetta but after 2 years and staying on a strict diet I have gained all 30 lbs back..other then that I have loved how the byetta works,4,5,5
"I love Byetta.  I didn't think I could give myself a shot, but it is easy.  I have lost 20 lbs and feel great.",5,5,5
"I started out on the 5mg and had no nausea at all. After about a month, I changed to the 10mg and had many low blood sugar episodes plus a LOT of nausea. A1C did drop from 7.4 to 6.8. I couldn't take the extreme nausea of the 10mg so I switched back to 5mg plus one tablet Glucovance twice a day. MUCH better! I find the injections easy even though I've never injected myself with anything before. I hope it keeps on working. I've even lost a few pounds without trying.",5,5,5
THIS IS A MIRICALE DRUG. BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS HAVE CHANGED TO THE BETTER AC-1 HAS DROPPED FROM 8 TO 5 AND BEST OF ALL HAVE LOST 35 POUNDS IN 10 MONTHS. I FEEL GREAT AND DOCTOR IS VERY PLEASED WITH MY NUMBERS.,4,5,5
"Lots of nausea and vomitting when 1st started--small bite of dark chocolate helps.  Lost weight quickly at first.  Had bad infection to finger, had to have IV antibiotics for 2 mos so had to stop and now am having hard time starting again, cause of nausea.  But also noting bad irritability/ meanness.  Seriously. Called mfg-- they say never heard of this.  But my neighbor was on it and had to stop cause of the mood affect.  Anyone else?  B/S did get better, have not seen doc in several mos cause I was off, but go soon.  Plan to get back on track.",4,4,4
My numbers went down dramatically--weight loss has been gradual--I feel better knowing my sugar levels are normal!,5,5,5
"Severe throwing up, plus constipation.  I didn;t care for these side effects at all.",5,1,5
Miracle drug need I say more!!,5,5,5
I have adult onset diabetes mellitus. My doc prescribed Byetta for me along with Altace. I have LOW blood pressure and have just found out that Alta is for high blood pressure. My legs and ankles are swollen. Can you please explain this to me. I certainly would appreciate it! Can't get an explanation to my satisfaction from my doc. Thank you.,4,2,3
"This medication did make me sick to my stomach for about 30-45 days which is the normal but once my body got use to it, I will admit that it curb my appetite so I wasn't eating all the time and maintain the weight gain.  However I didn't loose the weight even with the light exercise I do but kept me from gaining 25 lbs. that I was doing in a three month period before having my A1c testing.  The medication is really good and I recommend that you talk to your doctor about it.  Unfortunately my body did slowly rejected it and even with the injection and still on oral medication to treat the Type 2 diabetes, my body rejected everything and now I'm on insulin.  But for the one year I was on it, it really was effective and no complaints in using Byetta.",5,5,5
My A1C has dropped to 6 in 6 months. In Jan of 2007 it was 11.  I have lost 40 pounds and feel better than I have in years. ,5,5,5
I have used many medication over the years and this one is for me it don't have be swollen or let down with too high sugars or side effects that are hard to live with I have loss 20 pound and I like it.,4,5,5
"My blood sugars have never been in such good control, however, unlike most of the comments I have read, my nauseau is almost an every day occurance after 3 months.  Lost almost 40 lbs so I guess you deal with it if the outcome is successful.",5,2,5
"I spent 3 weeks struggling with nausea and weakness when I started on the 5 mcg, then had a week's reprieve before I started on the 10 mcg.  Spent another 3 weeks struggling.  Since then (about 6 months), it's been great going.  My bg is wonderfully controlled; I have reduced my glipizide from 20 mg/day to 5 mg/day and fully expect to come off all glipizide at some point.  Still take metformin.  Have lost 45 pounds without even trying -- appetite is greatly reduced.  Skipped my period the first month (thought I was actually reaching menopause, but no such luck).  ",4,5,5
i heard that this medication wasn't to be uded type 2 insulin dependent?  what goes?,5,5,5
"Have not lost pounds, however I have lost inches. Went down one bra size since the 1.5 months I have been on it. Pants need to pulled up more often! Did not have any stomach troubles, which is good, since I have IBS also. I first had a fear of injections, but with the fineness of the BD needles, I barely feel anything.  Highly recommend type 2 patients try this if the A1C test is over 7.",5,5,5
been on byetta for 4 months and have lost 26lbs. nausea was a problem for awhile but like losing weight and feel alot better and my a1c was 5.8 at last count. they need to check this drug out for obesity cause it works on your appetite great. can't eat very much at meals but still works on my diabetes great drug in my opinion,5,5,5
"At my last blood check my sugars had been down with no high peaks, I have lost over 50 lbs.  I have had a few low blood sugar moments but was told this could happen so was prepared for them.  Overall this has been a very effective treatment for me.",5,5,5
"it has been a great drug, have been injecting in the stomach, need to change to location, was not aware to use the in the upper arm or thigh must better muscle there and not so much redness.over all great drug for lowering my blood sugar along with my other meds...and weight lose has been about 40 lbs along with walking about 6 miles a week..",4,4,4
Losing weight fairly quickly (11 pounds). Upset stomach lasts only a couple of weeks. Blood sugar coming under more control. Would like for it to control better. Only been on it for 1.5 months. ,4,5,4
I was very sick for the first 3 weeks with nausea that has cleared. I have lost 30lbs. in 4mos. My Alc has dropped to 5.9 in 3 mos. ,5,5,5
"dramatic reduction in a1c - from 8.0 to 5.9 from month 6 to month 9 of treatment, after oral meds were losing their effectiveness. Byetta replaced Actos in my regimen (also take glipizide and metformin, plus quinapril for kidneys). At month 9, following the 5.9 a1c, have cut in half the glipizide treatment. Appetite controlled, have lost nearly 20 lb from my starting 230, feel wonderful about that. Patients, don't fear the injection, it's no big deal (no vein involved, just shoot it into the fat LOL). Occasional low-sugar feeling of weakness easily managed (and I'm glad my sugar is occasionally low these days - nice change). HIGHLY recommend Byetta and the endocrinologist who prscribed it for me.",4,5,5
None,1,1,1
I have used Byetta for almost 8 months and I love it. My doctor & I have spent so many years trying to get by b/s under control and this is the only med that has worked. The only complaint I have is that every pen is different; my body reacts differently. I have learned that the first 2 days of the new pen can be miserable but I learn what and when I can eat. My heart medication has been cut in half and I feel awesome. Thanks to my doctor encouraging me into using Byetta.,4,5,5
"Although I've only been on Byetta for a month, I've noticed a great improvement in my glucose levels. I haven't experienced any nausea and have less of an appetite. It has taken time to adjust to the injections though.",2,4,5
I have been on Byetta for 14 mo. and i have lost 103 lbs. with hard work and watching what i eat every meal. I wk out at the gym 5 or 6 times a wk. and for 45 mins. to an hour.my son has helped me a lot.,5,5,5
"I've been using this drug for 3 months now and I like it. At first it made me nauseous, but then I learned the trick was to take it 45 minutes before I ate and the nausea went away. I've lost 10 pounds already. It's a wonderful appetite supressant. Since I know I'm not going to be very hungry at lunch, I'm able to make better food choices for lunch. ",5,5,5
"I only had one thing that I wasn't pleased with and that was the nausea,it was very intense for about 2 weeks.then it subsides. It was a great weight loss. I find the advantages of the drug well worth the side effects. I feel that I have more control over my blood sugar than I have in ten years!! I wish I was aware of it sooner. Just not knowing what my high readings have done to some of my vital organs is scarey. I feel now that I'm on the right track and I finally have a peace of mind about my health.",5,5,5
"i was on this drug for 6 monthes. great to loose some weight 60 lbs to be exact. but it was like a drug induced anorexia. i could not eat .the smell of food was horrific. now i find out i was not supposed to be on insilin while using this drug ,  perscribed by the same dr. almost killed me whats up with that? !",4,1,1
"Just started trial test.  Will get a Met Panel Blood test in five more days.  So far I have noticed a drop in the average daily glucose readings.  Hopefully, this bodes well for the effectiveness of the drug.  If it proves effective, I will replace Januvia, which will almost make up for the cost difference.",5,4,4
Taking 3 mths it has lowered my A1C.  Also lost a few lbs.,5,5,4
works great ... helping me loose weight!!!,5,5,5
invokana works well for me - however I need to find another med because invokana is not affordable. I tried patient assistance but was denied assistance,5,5,5
I TAKE THIS FOR CROHN'S DISEASE. IT IS THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR ME. USE THIS WHEN I DO NOT FEEL LIKE MIXING THE POWDER VERSION.,4,4,4
I have had chronic diarrhea for years and I finally found a doctor who did testing and found that I have excess bile acid.  This medicine is a bile acid sequestrant and for the first time I'm able to have a normal life without worrying where the closest bathroom is.  I've really had no problems with the medicine besides possible increased urination.,4,5,5
"After the first three pills, one hour later experienced severe headache (migraine) light sensitivity, and extreme abdominal bloating, severe hemmroidal (sp?) flare up with constipation and rectal bleeding. Dizziness. Took three days to recover. That was only taking half the recommended dose",1,1,1
if you take levothyroxine - the welchol prevents your body from asorbing the levothyroxine.  most doctors are not aware of this.  i have begun taking the levothyroxine four hours prior to the first daily dose of welchol.  we will see how this works,3,4,4
"so far it has been great, I have been on the oral before and was taken off due to heat problems but all the replacement meds had such bad side effects that I asked to get back on it...",5,4,4

The medication causes my blood pressure to drop so be careful!,4,3,3
"I have type 2 Diabetes, been on Metformin, which has been managing my diabetes. Last month my Dr. put me on Cycloset, one pill per day, saw him three weeks later, my A1c was 6.5. He upped my dose to two per day.  I have had nausea,upper stomach pains, diarria, and been very tired since I have been taking this medicine.  I am tired of feeling like I have the Flu. My next appointment is in a month, until then, I am going to discontinue taking the Cycloset and see if I feel better..I don't like what it is doing to me.",1,2,3
"This made me feel awful, I was tired , slugish and really out of it.I also after only 4 days on the lowest dose experienced really high blood sugar and it just kept getting worse.Also my feet were very swollen by the end of every day not something i've ever had before. Within 24 hours of stopping I felt great again and with only metformin my blood suger was almost normal. Would not reccomend this to anyone. ",3,1,1
"Adverse effect of Cycloset, taken with Janumet and Amaryl  .8mg of Cycloset x 4 per day. started at 1/day/for first week, worked up to 2 per day second week.. Could not continue ramping up to recommended dose of 4 pills per day. Experienced chest pains, fatigue, upset stomach, vomiting. Discontinued taking pills. Felt great.  Spoke to my endocrinologist. She recommended ""sticking it out again"" to reach the recommended dosage levels of 4 pills.   Tried it again in 2 weeks, same results, but, incredibly, after taking the drug, my glucose levels actually increased following the 2 hour administration. Woke up at 700 am, took 2 pills, took reading = 132. Had black coffee, 1 egg, 1 piece cheese. Reading after 2 hours = 198, with no carbs. Reading stayed high into the night. This effect was repeated for several days.  Tried same meal after discontinuing Cycloset. Initial reading = 135, post meal= 141. This effect was repeatable during the 2 week period in which I was taking the drug. Perhaps if I made it to the recommended dose of 4 x .82mg, it would work, but getting there is not worth the suffering, and there is no guarantee it would abate at some point. Finally gave up completely. Hope this helps  I was better off not taking the Cycloset.",1,1,1
"I had the same experience as Cheryl, this medicine gave me flu- like symptoms, really horrible! My doctor wanted me to give it time, I gave it almost a year. Awful pain in my stomach, constant nausea, & lethargic, I refused to take it anymore & was switched to Amryl, which is working great. I really think this medicine Cycloset is headed toward the recall list in the very near future. TERRIBLE!",1,1,1
"I take byetta, and metformin for my type 2 diabetes, my fasting readings are between 105 -120 my last A1C reading was 7.1 so my Dr. perscribed Cycloset.  It is horrible! I have never felt so sick in all my life! He wanted me to work my way up to taking 6 pills a day. I can barely handle 2.  I have tried to take 3 but I can't even function.  I am always throwing up, I guess this is how you are supposed to ""lose weight"" on this pill. It hasn't made a difference in my daily blood suga readings, which were good to excellent to begin with.  I don't recommend this drug for anyone. I don't know how much longer I will be taking it, it has not benefitted me at all. ",1,1,1
"Ive been on Cycloset for about 3 month's now after being on Metformin Ext Release.  My cycloset dosage is ,125.  I was on Metformin for about 4 years, read about cycloset's effect as far as having dopamine help with the blood sugar levels, so I asked my PCP (primary care phys)that I wanted to try cycloset.  My recent lab results were considered normal with my a1c at 6.3.  I'm considered pre-diabetic, and have been for the last 3 years.  Ironic that my Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine diagnosed it, and saw that my vitamin D levels were low. When I last saw my PCP, he recommended that I track my blood sugar mg/dL, and the last 10 ave for fasting was 113.2mg/dL, and post meal last 10 readings were ave at 123.5mg/dL.  I have not had noticeable adverse symptoms using cycloset.  I plan to keep using it through 2012, and reassess for 2013.  I am 53 yrs old, 6ft 2in, and weight in at 296lbs. I bodybuild (weightlifting) as a hobby, 2+ hrs 5days/week, and 45min-1hr cardio.",5,5,4
"Male age 53 type 2 diabetes 10+ years. Started taking Cycloset 12/1/11. When up to 3 tablets had syncope and nausea, thought to be due to an interaction with Sudafed. Reduced to 2 tablets per day and no Sudafed and had another episode of syncope and nausea 2/5. Blood sugar was never improved with this medication. Discontinuing immediately.",4,1,1
"I am a female, age 50, and have been a Type II diabetic for 6 years with elevated fasting blood sugars. I take extended release Metformin, Glymiperide, and Victoza. The tiny cycloset tablets are easy to swallow but must be taken within 2 hours of waking which can make it easy to forget. I didn't notice any side effects until the third week after taking 3 tablets every morning. I felt extremely nauseated, had nasal congestion, head aches lasting the better part of the day, and itchy and swollen eyelids. Between feeling bad most of the day and having co-workers comment on how ill I looked everyday, I decided to stop taking cycloset. The lowest fasting blood sugar reading I ever got was 120 at the highest dose. Normally my fasting sugar is around 150.",5,2,3
new drug-so far good effects,5,5,5
I have noticed that I have had an increase in my sex drive since I started taking this medication and a reduction in Hot flashes and night sweats. I believe I have a problem with ADD and I am able to concentrate and stayed focused on one project at a time since I started taking this medicine.,5,5,5
"This is a test, please remove this.",5,5,5
brilliant sugar levels control,5,5,5
"GI problems with regular Metformin after 1 yr.  GI problems with Metformin ER after 2 yrs. Saw no improved A1c without ""loading up"" on Metformin, which then caused intestinal problems and maybe wreaked havoc on my liver.",1,1,3
I have been treated now for about 5 weeks and have lost 5 kgs and found a huge improvement in my overall well being with the ability to exercise more as a result of having more energy,5,5,5
PRODUCED POSSIBLE UTI AND YEAST INFECTION,5,1,5
only been using it for 3 weeks but I have seen my sugars level out and go lower. normally my afternoon reading were in the high 300s now they are in the 150-200 range. my issue is the size of the needle it is 23 gauge and I have a hard time getting it to pierce my skin. Additionally when I remove the needle either the site bleeds or the solution comes out. will be discussing this with my doctor.,2,3,3
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,4,2,3
"It made my blood sugar return to great numbers; 95, 103, 105, 107, but it also made me feel very tired, very jittery and my throat swelled up to where it was very scary.  When I got up the next morning, after a very long and restless night, my sugar count was 166, which I am sure came from the stress of worrying.  I am not taking it anymore.",5,1,5
My numbers were lower with glyburide. I have a bad yeast infection. I am not sure if I am going to continue taking this med. ,5,3,3
"I would not recommend this medication because it caused me bladder pain and urinary urgency, literally pee yourself!  I could tell it was not good for my body at all.  I stopped taking it after a few days.",1,1,1
"Don't listen to the crazy reviews... if you stay away from sugar (NO SWEET TEA OR SODA, OR ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS) and watch your diet the side effects are minimal. I drank a lot of water to stay hydrated and keep my pee clear. No infections. I was on the pill for 2 months and my a1c went from 6.6 to 6.1 (back into pre diabetes territory) within 3 months. I am now off the meds. It's not a magic pill you have to do the work and change your habits along with it.",5,5,5
"MASSIVE side effects! Headaches, yeast infections, flu like symptoms. Rash, allergic reaction, hives. Sore throat, loss of voice. 3 weeks off the meds and still experiencing massive reactions. ",5,5,5
"Before I used Farxiga my A1C was almost 14 and I was on 2 different insulins and 5 other pills, But with a strick diet, exercise, and drinking 6 bottles a water per day and seeing my Diabetic Nutritionist, in 3 months my A1C has came down to 9. That's Amazing. I do urinate a lot, have had a few years infections, and experience frequent back pain, urine have a fruity smell, but the dropping of my A1C, out weigh my side effects. I will continue taking Farxiga and my goal for my A1C is 6. I am insulin free and only on Farxiga, metformin and januvia. ",5,5,5
EASE OF TAKING IT NA DHELPS ME A LOT,5,5,5
"On med for over a year. Mfg coupon made cost affordable as ins. would not cover. A1c went from over 10 to 6.4 in combination with other therapies. I have BPH, so trouble peeing anyway. No yeast (yet). Have discontinued glimepiride and Tresiba. Farxiga is a wonderful drug for me!",5,5,5
"My A1C went down to 6.0 while on this and I lost over 50 lbs. I got the initial prescription and a six month supply while visiting the Philippines. I stopped using it as in the US the cost without insurance was over $2,500 for a 3 month supply. I will buy next time I go overseas and have money left over... The savings card is still too expensive an option.",5,5,5
Switched from Invokana due to prescription insurance requirement. Morning fasting blood sugars were pretty good but yeast infections were unbearable so I discontinued.,5,1,3
"Been on it for 10 months now, and lowered a1c from 7 to 5.9, and lost 50 pounds. Only complaint is the cost.",4,4,5
I seemed to binge a lot on sweets while I was on this drug.  I stopped taking it because I couldn't afford it and have eaten a lot less sweets since I have stopped.,5,3,3
"I have been on this for a month... So I can't say what my A1C is... It was only 7 when I started... Down from 9.7 3 months ago...but, I did get a slight yeast infection the first week, but I really wanted to keep taking this, because it enables me to take less insulin before meals because it keeps my numbers down to around 100... So my Dr prescribed 3 of the pills for yeast infection and they took it away and I have had no more problems with that. My numbers are still great, for me, and so far minimal side effects. I do have some pains off and on in my kidneys, but nothing major. Yes, I am going to the bathroom more, but that's not a big deal. I eat low carb... As much as I can, I'm not perfect... But I don't drink anything but water and occasionally unsweetened tea. I think, for me, this is working well because I don't eat tons of sugar, bread or starches...so yea... My diet is boring, but I do have days where I eat things I shouldn't, just not everyday. I am also losing weight now, about 3 weeks after starting... I have lost 7 pounds since I started, which was probably just water retention. So, I am sticking with this because the results are worth it for me. I can't take metformin because it reacts with my depression medicine, so this is the alternative for me. I also take long lasting and fast acting insulin to manage my type 2.",4,4,4
"I am pre-disposed to Gout, hereditary reasons, so I am careful always and take 100mg Allopurinol. After taking this drug in one year I had the most gout attacks, and most serious, debilitating gout attacks I have ever had in my life, not just in my feet but in my knees. One knee was so swollen for 3 months that colchicine was not even helping. Uric acid counts went through roof and had to go on 300mg allopurinol, did not help. Was getting gout attacks for no reason, nothing dietary could be linked. I could not wait to get off this drug, and within 3 months of stopping, my uric acid levels returned to normal/low. My Dr said probably because of competition in my kidneys between the drug making them work on the sugar, it was letting the uric acid get out of control. Beware of this and similar drugs they are pushing on TV especially to remove sugar through the kidneys, especially if you have hereditary gout. ",4,1,2
"The yeast infection started the 2nd day. my sugar began staying high for hours after i ate, did nothing for me except to make me unable to pee much and heartbeat was rapid, and I had to fast for hours for my sugar to come down, I guess it did opposite for me than what it was suppose to. ",1,1,1
I have been on Farxiga now over a year. My HBA1C went from 9.3 to 7.0 so far. Everytime I get checked it lowers. I have had no side effects.,5,4,4
Ive been on it 10 mg for over a year have had yeast infections often. I have since become so infected that I bleed and cant use toilet paper tried all hurt so bad.Ive been fighting this for months straight finnaly stoped farxiga today and pray my female parts go back to normal its been hell.I went on web site and resherched and saw this is a side affect so called my doctor.It id help my a1c but cant take this anymore.,4,1,5
No problems at all a1c went from 6.7 to 5.4. Lost 13 pounds so far. Feel great.,5,5,5
"On Farxiga for 11 months. Lost 30 pounds without dieting and exercise, but had to buy smaller clothes. Remains to be seen if A1C is coming down specifically due to the drug.",5,5,5
"This drug almost killed me. I took it for about 2 months. At first, the side effects were excessive urination with burning, and severe thirst. Then came the excruciating headaches, dizziness, and fast heart rate. By the end of the second month, I had continued all the side effects, but then had arrhythmia which caused 3 fainting spells. My heart was pounding out of my chest. Went to a cardiologist who determined after extensive testing including stress test, PET scan and Holter monitoring that the cause of my heart issues was Farxiga. After stopping this drug, everything went back to normal. It took a full 3 months for the drug to get out of my system. ",5,1,2
"Have been on this drug for more than 6 months. Lowered A1C a point or so. I am so unhappy though. I constantly feel a burn when I urinate, once a month or every 6 weeks-the longest I have gone without-I get a yeast infection that involves pain and burning first and than itching--one like I have never had before. Oral yeast pills do nothing, have to stop the Farxiga to make it go away and usually 2 rounds of over the counter creams.  I have tightened up on my eating watching sugars closely and still get these infections. I also started to feel very tired, and had some abdominal cramping making me think maybe a urinary tract infection but none present. Thirst is unbelievable, I drink and drink. Wake at night with such a dry mouth can hardly swallow. Dry skin starting to become a problem.  I quit taking for about a month and felt better--started taking and within a week burning started again, thirst and dry mouth started shortly after. I don't know what else I can do--tried adding probiotics didn't matter. It did also seem to help my b/p go down but I don't feel its worth it. Tired of the burning and infections and having to worry about them. Did it work--yes it seemed to make a difference but its not worth it to me with the other problems. ",5,2,4
After taking this for 3 months my A1C is still 8.  I do have some vulvar irritation but baby wipes help.  I'm also experiencing some lower left back pain.  Blood work shows no kidney problem but I wonder if this pain is due to farxiga.  May ask doctor if I should keep taking it since my A1C hasn't improved.,2,2,2
I experienced volvavaginitis with spongiotic dermatitis with prominent pigmentation incontinence.  I had to endure a biopsy and feared a vulvaectomy as a result of using farxiga for 2 months.  Dr said it may all have to be cut off!,4,1,1
So far everything has been great i have lost 60 lbs and have dropped my A1C 1.4 pts in six months other than going to the bathroom alot if i eat too much sugar i have no complaints,5,4,5
"I was only on this drug for about 10 days. I could barely walk and when I did I felt dizzy, sick to my stomach. Was not on it long enough to evaluate effectiveness.",5,1,1
"Initial results have been good lowering my glucose levels and A1C.  Taking it for five months, I did develop and still have blisters on my penis have been applying medication to reduce itching and redness. Over the past couple of months have had bouts of hives and will soon begin tests to determine source of these but don't expect anything to come from this.  After discussing with doctor today I will be discontinuing farxiga and resorting only to Metformin until hives can be diagnosed.",4,3,4
Have been taking for about 2 months.  Extreme thirst so that I can't go anywhere without a water bottle.  No weight loss.  Cost is through the roof and cannot afford.  Cannot get for free as I am retired and on medicare.  Cost is $348.  Not happening.  Biggest problem is rapid heartbeat and profuse sweating (something have never had a problem with).  Will discontinue tomorrow and see doctor next week. Never been so uncomfortable.  And the kicker is my waking blood sugar is 130-140.  A1C stays about 7-8.  Just not happy with this medication.  ,5,1,2
I tried this drug and had a pounding heart that I could feel and my heart rate was very fast.  I was very thirsty a lot and nothing I drank helped get rid of the thirst.  I just felt terrible taking this drug and I took it less than a week. ,1,1,2
"No side effects, 10 pound weight loss since I began taking. So far so good! Seems like the more sugar I take in the more often the bathroom visits.  But other than that, no complaints.  And it's free for a year.",4,4,4
Great Medication got my sugar down to 120 fasting from 200.Got my a1c down from 9.0 to 7.4.This is the BEST NEWS EVER LOST GET THIS 18 LBS from talking this medication WITHOUT DIET OR EXERCISE YES !!!!!!!,5,5,5
"Extreme thrist up to 24 oz per hour of water needed, extreme perspiration to the point of needing to change clothing 2-3 a day, back pain equal to menstrual cramping, did little to low glucose may have dropped it 5-10 points on monitor blood sugars.   ",5,1,1
I have been using Farxiga for about 6 months or so. I can really tell a difference if I forget to take it. It really helps my blood sugar. I definitely have to drink more water because it makes me dehydrated. I lost about 10 pounds at first but about a total of 15 lbs. O really do love what this med does for me!,5,5,5
Caused UI all the time.  Released too much sugar,3,1,1
very good glucose levels . lowered a1c from 9.5 to 7.1 and lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks . I stay very thirsty . My ears ring constantly and get a little yeast infection often,5,4,5
"I started this drug on Wednesday, and on Sunday my urine was dark brown, my edema on both feet went away and I lost 9 lbs.  I am currently on Janumet and Byetta, and even with them my A1C rose to 8.0.  My next 3 month blood test will reveal whether my A1C went down or not.",4,4,4
"Yes it lowered my BS, however the side effects of this drug for me were the absolute worst! All I drink is water and lots of it, but it still wasn't enough. I got so backed up that I had to stop taking it. I had unbearable joint pain too. After being off for a week or two my doctor had me try taking a smaller dose. Still had to make sure I drink loads of water, but now have a fungal infection in a place no one EVER wants an infection. Stopped taking, will NEVER take again.",2,1,4
"Have been on Farxiga for 4 months and my A1C has gone from 9.4 to 8.0, and I've lost about 6 pounds. Have not had any side effects from this drug so far. I am paying attention to my kidneys and watching for UTI's, just in case something crops up. So far so good, but I worry about the higher incidence of cancer with this medication. It will be hard to afford Farxiga after my free year prescription card from them runs out, it will be $75 a month after that.",5,5,5
"My A1C has been up and down over the years, but the last year it has been in the 7.2-8.4 range.  I've taken many different drugs that seem to work for a couple of months, but then I become more resistant and have to find something else. I finally had to start taking insulin.  The results are similar to just taking medication with the amount of insulin I take going up after a period of time.  My doctor introduced me to Farxiga last year and I have been taking it for about 5 months.  My first A1C after starting was 6.9, down from 7.4.  Since then I have had reading of 5.2, 5.1 and 5.6.  Between each reading I have worked with my doctor to reduce the amount of insulin I take.  I am now taking about 50% of the insulin I used to take and still looking to decrease.   ",5,5,5
"Have only been on it 3 months, earlier A1C 7.2, April 9,2015, A1C 6.8. I have never had this good a lowering. Did not change much.   I notice more desire of fluids, less appetite, loss about 5 lbs, more urination.  Will do blood work in July, 2015.",5,5,5
I have been on Farxiga for 4 months now. I have been taking Metformin 750 mg to bring down my A1C that was at 7.6 at its highest. The doctor introduced me to Farxiga and started taking it in December 2014. It is now April 2015 and my A1C is at 6.5 and my blood sugar is at 116. I have more work to do but it is heading in the right direction. I have lost almost 10 lbs but I don't see this as a weight loss medication. I drink lots of water and try to eat a healthy lifestyle and work in some exercise. So far so good and I hope it will stay like this. I've been lucky with no side effects.,5,5,5
"I have been on this medication for two months-my blood sugars are within the normal range and I have lost 14 lbs. I have had no side effects-I am already a huge water drinker and do not eat sugar so havent had to deal with some of the side effects others have had. I also take a daily probiotic to ward of any yeast imbalances caused by the medicine. I have been on insulin, metoformin, glimiperide and this is the only thing that has worked for me. ",5,5,5
Using Farxiga has brought my blood sugar down to the 100s and 90s. Lost 13 lbs in about 3 months. No urinary issues as of yet. My last A1c was 6.4 down from 7.4   I have not had a blood sugar over 130 in this last month.,5,5,5
"The medication has brought my A-1 cs down, but I worry about the long term effects of it with bladder cancer and the warnings, I am looking at a more homeopathic plan over this drug",5,5,5
"Finally something that brings my blood sugar down.  Discovered I must drink loads of water (which is good for a person anyway).  If I cheat and consume sugar, and as it comes out in the urine, I pay for it and have had close calls with urinary infection. So I drink loads of diet cranberry juice.  I have lost 10 lbs in the last two months, which is wonderful.  As long as I don't cheat on my food intake and drink lots of water to continue flushing my system and stave off dehydration, I have found Farxiga to be the most effective for me after taking many types of medications over the past 15 years of fighting Type 2 Diabetes.",5,4,5
This medication has brought my blood sugar glucose level down by 100 pts!,5,5,5
Did not change my AIC. Used for approx. 6 weeks. Developed worst yeast infection ever. Now 3 weeks into treatment and still not over. Will return to gyno to see if treatment drugs have to be changed again ,5,1,2
"I have low BP...this increased it dramatically, dizzy every time I stood up!  At the first twinge of UTI (after 2 weeks) I dropped it ugh.....  You lose ""WATER"" Weight from dehydration!",4,1,2
"My doctor gave me two weeks worth of Farxiga and it did wonders for my diabetes I used it with Levemir and metformin When I ate too much sugar, I got yeast infection That I hated ",5,5,5
"2 months ago I was placed on a new medication (not Farxiga) and my sugars went up not down. My sugars have not been so high in over a year 160-224 fasting. Taken this medication for 72 hours and my sugars have been 120 fasting. I am urinating more than I use to, but Nothing I can't handle. I get yeast infections constantly due to other medications so I am not to sure if I will get more. So far I like this medication. I am worried about weight loss, I am only 100 pounds now. ",5,5,5
"It's true it removes sugar, but if you eat too much sugar, you will get yeast infections. I learned that the hard way. I had no other side effects. ",4,4,5
I started with an AIC of 10 and after 3 months of Farxiga AIC is down to 7.5.,5,5,5
"caused a variety of side effects, that eventually lead to hospitalization. collapsed in house due to sever dehydration and very low electrolytes. it slowly dehydrates patients with sever reactions. it lowered my bs, but at what cost. not worth it",1,1,4
"Working excellent. It seems my Diabetes is now controlled. I use this in combination with metformin and insulin. I have used many different combinations of drugs over the years to control my Diabetes, but so far this has worked best.",5,5,5
"I've only been on this med for 3 weeks. It seems to be working very well. My blood sugar levels aren't great,  but are very steady. I feel like I would benefit more by adding metformin. Side effects have been thirst and dry mouth. I have also lost 10 lbs In  3 weeks with no change in diet.  ",5,4,4
"I have had Type 2 diabetes for over 10 yrs and always struggled to keep my A1-C under 7. I must admit I could have tried harder but it's tough when your always on the road working. I started taking Farxiga in August and last week was my first A1-C test since I started taking Farxiga. This medicine was sent from heaven. My A1-C was 5.9 I had to look twice, I couldn't believe it. Thank You, AstraZeneca, Thank You. You've made my struggle a little bit bearable. ",5,5,5
THIS MEDICATION IS RAISING MY BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS...DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH OTHER MEDICATION FOR DIABETES..DON'T KNOW WHY THE DR. CHANGED ME..I AM GOING BACK TO MY OLD MED..,4,1,1
I am craving salt and arthritis pain that was not severe is waking me up at night. At first I felt great now after the 2nd month its not working for me and it is expensive. I will stop taking this medication.,4,2,3
I have been on this medication for 1 month now and see remarkable improvement in the readings when I check my blood sugar levels.  I have had little to no side effects and hope my physician will take me off of some of the insulin I am currently taking.,5,5,4
"I have lost weight and its lowered my blood sugars, I am concerned too about side effects and hope if I lose more weight have lower A1Cs I can get off of it, I have had some skin issues too since starting it, not sure if its the medication or not. ",5,4,5
Initially scared by cancer talk but this drug has been used in Europe for years w/ no issues. Lowered my A1C and have lost 15 pounds with no effort. Luckily no side effects for me at this time. ,5,5,5
"The side effects are unbearable. I've had not only constant yeast infections but severe fungal breakouts in places that a woman (or man for that matter) does not want any weird fungal breakouts! I've been so depressed and unable to shake myself out of my sad spells, and for the first time in my life I experienced a UTI. I drink nothing but water because I stay so thirsty. The thirst is so severe that I can't go to my college classes without a cup of water, because an hour and 10 minutes is too long for me to go without getting a drink. It has kept my blood sugar around 100, which is great, but my BS doesn't run very high most of the time because of a healthy diet, so I've stopped taking the drug. I'm sticking to metformin 2x a day and a healthy diet. As for the weight loss, I lost an initial 4-5 pounds the first two weeks, but two months later I'm at the same weight and haven't lost any more, so it's not worth it for me. This is the worst drug I've ever taken. It's the worst. ",4,1,4
"This medication is very effective at lowering my blood sugar.  I was reluctant to take due to jock itch/yeast infection side effect, but so far, I have not suffered any of this.  I am somewhat concerned about long-term side effects  including bladder cancer. ",5,5,5
"I was dx March 20th and went on Metformin.  I averaged a 4 lb loss per month on it.  Three months later I added Farxiga.  I averaged a 6 lb loss since then.  It is now Aug 31 and I have lost a total of 32 lbs.  The weight is just falling off and seems to be coming off faster.  I've started gentle exercise.  I have to be vigilant in personal cleanliness to avoid yeast infections.  I feel them coming on but it never really gets started.  No problems with UTI.  No problems with more frequent urination.  I feel better, more energetic.  I do have blurry vision and my balance is sometimes off leaving me staggering like a drunk but I just have to concentrate and maybe sit for a minute and it passes.  This could be a side effect of a different medication that I take and  not the Farxiga.  Did I say that I FEEL good?  I thought life was just going to be pain until I finally died but I am now able to enjoy myself!  I get Farxiga free with the prescription card offered on their website.  My insurance does not cover it and it costs $348.00 a month at Walgreens.  Thank you for this free offer!!!",5,5,5
"Have been on for 3 months and thrilled at my low BS now plus have lost 20 lbs in this time. Nothing had worked for me. Have had to take cranberry pills every day to keep from getting UTI and Diflucan for yeast infections. But in order to lower my BS and lose weight, I will tolerate these side effects.",5,5,5
"This drug came highly recommended. I was expecting frequent urination but this was a serious understatement. I was going every 30 minutes and drinking everything I could get my hands on. In less than a week I returned to my physician, had stat labs drawn and was admitted to the hospital for two days to flush the drug from my system. Potassium, and creatin were high and I was extremely weak.",1,1,1
It helped me keep my sugar down very good.,5,5,5
"Medicar & my insurance dont pay for this drug. $314? What a joke! Got to be something out there that helps that is affordable. Told my Dr that and he said ""what do you want me to do about how much it costs""?",4,1,4
"I was excited to start this med. but I urinate ever hour and at night ever 2 hours.  On the plus my bs is lower and I lost several lbs the first week.  That's the only reason I stayed on the med. is because of the weight loss.  Seems to be some bad side effects in the long run CANCER, from what I read.  I'm reading reviews on other meds.  hopefully safer and more reviews.",4,2,2
"I took 5mg of Farxiga to start.  It worked for a few days and then had no effect on BS.  Initially lost 4 pounds, but gained that back.  Doc put me on 10mg and still not working.  I also got two yeast infections in three weeks.  Other reviews state that users were tired.  I have been very tired and having trouble waking up!  Wasn't sure what was up, but now I am wondering if it is caused by this drug.  Very bummed.  It worked very well for two days.",1,1,1
"I was only able  take it for 4 days. Made me feel weak, tired and gave me a yeast infection. Why would manufacturer think that a woman would want to take something that would give them a yeast infection?  MISERABLE!",5,2,5
This medicine made me feel all over weak extremely tired just plain sick.  I had to go to bed and discontinue after 3-5 days. Standing was worse.,2,1,3
No problems. Controls blood sugar well. Curbs appetite.,5,5,5
"Farxiga is the first oral med to work for me.  As a side benefit, I am losing weight without even trying.   I have read the cautions and I don't fall into the groups that should not take this.",5,5,5
"Even though this drug has worked well for me, I am considering discontinuing use of it, because of the articles stating that it can possibly cause bladder and breast cancer. I very disappointed, because it was working so well for me.",5,4,4

"I have been a Type 2 Diabetic since 2010, and was keeping my BG somewhat managed with Metformin and Diet, until this year.  My numbers shot up to the low 200's, so my physician put me on Glimepiride.  My numbers have come back down to the 120's.  I haven't gotten an A1C with the drug yet, but hopefully it'll be lower.   ",4,5,4
"68 y old 188lbs. On metformin for 20 yrs. dose slowly increased to [email protected] 2 day. it did not work as well. started glipiride @ 5MG. still so so. Made drastic diet change, cut most carbs ",3,3,3
other drugs could not get my A1C down. on glimepiride 2mg in the morning has gotten me down.  from a steady 150 to 180 down to 100 to 120.  only side effect seems to be a tired feeling all day.  will check with my doctor at next visit.,5,5,5
I had tried metformina and Onglyza before and in my Glimipirida is the best drug so far. I'm taking 1mg after breakfast and another one after dinner. I can keep my levels below 140 after meal and in the morning I wake up with 80 ,5,5,5
"I've had Type 2 since 2009.  Take 2000 mg Metformin nightly, but was still not able to control my fasting BGs.  Started Glimepiride 1 mg nightly before dinner.  Sometimes my BG level 2 hour after dinner is in teh 90's and my morning numbers are usually in the low 100's.  My last 5 A1Cs have been below 6.  My new doctor suggested stop taking Glimepiride since my A1Cs were so low and the Glimepiride could keep me from losing weight.  I've been off it for almost 2 months now, I haven't lost a bit of weight and my morning numbers have been above 130 and one day it was 178.  I think it's time to go back on it and maybe get another doctor.",5,5,5
This medication has not helped me at all.  We have increased dosage and still no help.  I am limited to the drugs I can take due to kidney disease.  ,1,1,1
"I have taken metformin since 2002, started at 500mg a day, up to 2000 a day. 3 years ago I had started to have major pancreatitis, sugars went up, A1C went up. I wore out my ability to utilize metformin. My doctor switched me to Tradjenta 5mg and Actos 30mg to replace metformin. After 6 months I started to use Glimepiride 2mg a day just now, first day I crashed a little because I dropped 100 points within 2 hours. When youâ??re not used to that big of a drop you it does not feel good. I had 2 spoons of honey and within 10 minutes felt normal. I have lost over 60lbs over 15 years, lots of hard aerobic exercise, zone diet foundation for eating. One thing that really works for constipation is lots of fiber, I mean psyllium husks based is the most effective aside from fruits and vegetables that are really high in fiber. Itâ??s a lot of work to be a healthy diabetic but worth it.",5,5,5
"Been taking for 11 months, it did reduce my A1c but had bad gastric reactions. Constantly constipated. Also, raised my liver counts dangerously high. I would never had known if I had not participated in my company's health fair. Regular doctors don't check your liver if you are not a drinker. If you are feeling tired all the time, have your doc check your liver!!!",5,1,4
I am 65 years  old male.I was taking  1000 mg of metformin for about 5 years. I started to get itching and hives so my doctor prescribed glimepiride 2 mg. it has controled my blood sugar level but I feel tired all day.may be I should talk to my doctor about adjusting my dosage. I also should be eating lunch regularly.It really makes more hungry for food.,5,5,5
"This has really been beneficial - I couldn't get my A1C down on the highest dose of Metformin alone.  In six months, it has dropped from 8.4 to 7.1 with zero side effects.  They said it could possibly lower your blood sugar and you'd get really dizzy, but I am always anyway so haven't noticed a difference!",5,5,5
I was taking 1000mg metformin 2x/da. A1C kept rising; daily meter readings were erratic. Started glimepiride; no change in A1C; readings were quite high in a.m. Started 30 units of insulin; A1C dropped from 9 to 7.9 to 6.8; morning readings still very high; afternoon/evening readings often drop to 45-60. I attribute this to having to take glimepiride in the morning and not at the same time as metformin.  Asked doctor if I could stop glimepiride and take one of my two doses of metformin in the morning instead of noon; he said no because its working and I just can't see it. Meter readings consistently range between 45-350. I'm seeking another doctor.  ,5,1,1
"I was taking Glimepiride(1mg,1/day), it was working well. I had a new doctor, and she switched me to Metformin (500mg, 2/day).  With Glimepiride, my A1C dropped from 6.4 to 5.7 in six months but with Metformin my A1C went from 5.7 to 7.8 in 8 months, and with terrible dizzy spells and nausea. So I am now back to Glimepiride! No liver or kidney problem!!! ",5,5,5
"I was on Janumet but decided I did not want to risk cancer so the doctor put me on 2mg of glimepiride and 1000mg of metformin. It has been great just have to watch low blood sugar when working harder than usual. I have since dropped to 1 mg a day, I wish Metformin did not tear up my stomach as bad as it does.",5,5,5
"Struggled with Metformin and Onglyza duo for a year or so. Dr. added 2mg glimepiride and BAMM - numbers are much lower.  A1C dropped dramatically from over 7 to 5.0.  Just make sure you have steady meals as it does drop glucose levels to the 70s if you're not eating at normal intervals.  Overall, very good so far.",5,4,5
"started off on 2mg didn't help my counts.  It made them go up.  by the time i got to 8mg, i started getting really weak, tired, chest pressure,effecting my eyes and felt like my skin was crawling and it messed with my kidneys.  stopped taking this medicine after 30 days.  Went back down to 2 mg.. it didn't help. stopped taking it all together today. my skin no longer feels like it is crawling and my eyes are getting better.  now have to go see a specialist since he isn't sure on what to do now.",4,1,1
"went from 1mg, then 2mg and did not help blood sugar. Two days ago was switched to 4mg and my blood sugar has sored. 289 yesterday and 233 today, after meals check. Had to quit taking metformin due to kidneys.  Why would the stronger dose make my blood sugar go way up? Had lettuce salad with chicken strips the first day and veggies with smoked beef sausage the second day.",5,1,1
"just started this med after metformin gave me unbearable cramps and loose stools!! Hoping it works, scared of side effects...",5,1,3
"I am 59 years old and started taking Glimepiride 2 mg twice a day about 3 or 4 years ago. I started noticing petit mal seizures shortly afterwards, but contributed them to other medical conditions. I started having gran mal seizures in November 2013, with the most recent seizure on 10/2/2014, where I was unconscious for 25 minutes. I need to find out if others are experiencing seizures also. I've decreased the dosage to 1 mg twice a day, but my sugar levels are rising. Any help or information would be appreciated. Thank you!   ",5,1,4
"I have been taking Glimepiride 4mg for less than a month.  I split the pill in half and only take 2mg a day.  It made me very light headed at first and dropped my blood sugar numbers by 100 points the first day I took it.  I do notice frequent urination and slight constipation since starting the medication.  I also am taking 1,000mg of MetFormin a day to control my Type 2.  ",5,4,5
I have noticed a slight sore throat on occasion and I see sore throat is one of the side effects. Has anyone else noticed this as effect of glimepiride?,5,4,5
"When initially diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes I started with metformin and insulin. After six months the doctor replaced the insulin with 2 mg of glimepiride per day.  My glucose levels have continued to drop.  My A1C when I was diagnosed was 12.4 and it is currently 6.3.  My main concern is that gimepiride can cause hypoglycemia if you are not careful with what you eat (or what you don't eat!).  I find that if I don't have a mid morning snack my glucose level tends to be too low late morning.  This may also be related to the fact that I very frequently exercise early in the morning.  I have not have any side effects from taking glimepiride and has allowed me to get off of insulin, so I am extremely happy with it.",5,5,4
glampiride has worked awesome for me for the first 8 years then they must of changed something in the ingredients in it because i started breaking out with a terrible horrible rash. the doctors took me off of it.  now they have been treating me with other diabetic meds but my A1C and my sugars are higher than before.   did they change the ingredients in the glimepiride with in the last 3 years?,5,5,5

Immediately could not breathe upon ingesting Glimepiride (Duetact). Was totally scary! Turned blue; thought I was dying!  Thought maybe reaction was because I happened to be in area of high altitude first time taking pill but happened again @ sea level. WHAT ingredient in drug caused this? Need to know so I can avoid!,1,1,1
Started out with fasting blood sugars at 109 each morning and they have increased to 157 today. ( About a week and a half now) I also take Januvia 50mg each morning. I don't eat anything after 5 or 6pm.  What is wrong?,5,2,3

okay i started taking 2mg once daily but had to cut to 1mg because bs was going too low also this drug is very string compared to metformin i took that for a couple of short periods because i was getting severe g.i. distress a nurse told me glimepiride does stuff with fat cells and its harder to lose weight im now doing okay as long as i dont screw up on carbs it just goes to say you may have to change dosages or medicines to get thebs where it should be before and after a meal also i reccomend seeing adiabetic counselor and they can realy provide you with info,5,3,3
This medication gives me headaches and trembeling of my hands. It works better than the metphormin I was on. The dr. told me this has higher risks so a I am a lil worried about this medication. I don't understand why he doesn't have me checking my glucose levels.,5,3,4

I try to maintain a proper diet; but, my glucose meter levels flucuate between 105 to 155 on the norm. Generally I can expect the higher end readings after drinking a lemonade or soda the night before.  Also, I have friends who are currently taking Metformine in amounts of 1000 to 2000 mg daily.  I do wonder why my dosage is seemingly low compared to them.  I would like some response if possible.  Thank You.",5,3,3

Since being on this med my blood sugars have gone from 400+ to almost normal. It hasn't been above 200 since taking it the lowest it's been is 98. My A1-c went from 9.1 to 7.2 in 3 months of taking it. I am very pleased with the med.,5,5,5

I had stomach problems, decreased energy, loss of interest in doing anything.  I forgot to take the Glimepiride one day and felt really great; took it the next and felt awful.  I called my doctor and went off the medication until my appointment next month.  I take Janumet for blood sugar and glimepiride did nothing to lower it as far as I can tell.  I also have high morning readings.",5,1,1

After one week of taking this drug.  I had un-controlable diarrhea.  I could not leave the house.  My doctor's nurse said I should keep taking the drug and the symptom MIGHT go away within a week.  ,3,1,1
I was taking this drug with 1500 mg of metformin at night with my last meal of the day because I had high sugar readings in the AM. Doc told me to switch to taking it with my usual dosage of 1000 mg metformin in the AM with breakfast - I experienced low blood sugar count of 56 about 4 hours after eating breakfast. I usually can't go under 100. Now the sugar is going too low. Does it work? Yes. Work too well? In my case the answer is probably yes.,5,3,4
"It is lowering my sugar levels,",5,5,4
"After reading some of the comments here, I now know others have similiar problems.  I was taking insulin injections to ensure that I would have a good knee surgery recovery.  It started to become noticeable that the insulin was starting to have no effect.  My doc put me on metformin, however, that caused severe stomach pain.  I could not handle even 1/2 of a pill.  He tried Glimperide at 4mg morning and 4mg evening with a meal.  I began to see a lower bs, so he increased it to 6mg twice a day.  I see this is an extreme dose, according to what I am reading here.  My stomach pain is once again flaring up, like an ulcer is developing.  I guess it is time to loose weight.  My stomach is bloated, extended with hard knots.  I am gaining weight.  ",5,3,4
"I was recently diagnosed and put on 2mg glimepride at breakfast and 500mg of metformin with dinner. In less than a month, my bs has dropped from 346 to 100, my vision has improved, and I've had no noticeable side efeects. ",5,5,5
"Dr. had me try Metformin, but I experienced higher A.M. readings than with the Glimepiride 4mg. Now back on Glimepiride 1/2 tablet with breakfast and 1/2 tablet with dinner.

Does this medicine cause dryness around your mouth?,4,4,4
"I was using this medicine 2 mg  along with Metformin 1000 mg.  Worked very effectively for first three months. But from fourth month I developed itching  and elevated discolouration of the skin, sour mouth and tongue. I reduced the dosage to 1 mg  and time of dosage to post food hoping to avoid the side effects.  Still after a fortnight  the side effects returned.  I was trying to persist with the medicine due to its effectiveness in controlling Blood sugars levels.  Now I find that I cannot ignore those side effects any more and reluctantly dropping the usage, because even more serious side effects like Liver disfunction etc.  Any suggestions, anybody?

I got a double steroid shot, with another follow up of 24mg the next day oral and 2 days later for the first time in a week am not showing the hives.  I have researched the drug and have not been able to find out why it affected me this way.  Can anyone help??  My primary physician has no answers.

Dr bumped me to 1000mg twice a day. Made me very sick to the point of calling into work for extreme diarrhea. Stopped taking it and contacted my Dr. He put me on 5mg twice a day.

"I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes over 10years ago. Earlier this year, my sugars were not under control, and the doctor put me on Glipizide 10mg (Watson 461). This brought my glucose levels back down. I then moved, and the new pharmacy gave my Glipizide 10mg (APO). After starting this medication, I woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating shoulder pain. The pain seemed to originate in the shoulder joint and radiated down into my fingers. I originally thought it was my exercise regimen, but realized this could not be as I have been exercising the same way for about 3 years. I then realized that I experienced the same pain when a former doctor prescribed the same form of Glipizide about 8 years ago. I had forgotten about this...but immediately stopped using the Glipizide. Now, after about a month, the pain has almost subsided completely. I also experienced numbness and swelling in my index finger (same side as the shoulder pain). That too is almost gone. I am concerned that neither the doctor nor the pharmacist told me about this side effect; it could have saved me a lot of painful nights.",5,1,2
"Just over a month ago, I developed extreme, excruciating pain in my left shoulder. This pain kept me awake at night. I also started feeling a numbness in my arm and swelling and numbness in my left index finger. I originally thought it was my exercise regimen, but I've been doing the same exercise for over 3 years. I realized that the onset of the pain occurred when I switched to the APO manufactured Glipizide (10mg). I stopped using the Glipizide, and after a month, the pain is almost gone, as is the swelling and numbness in my finger.",5,1,4

I will ask doctor to discontinue for 3 months and see if my alc is still below 7, and then just continue monitoring it.",4,2,3
Had great results with blood sugar levels. Unfortunately realized I can't take it due to allergic reaction. ,4,4,3
Have been taking this drug for 14 years with great sucess. Have had no side effects.;  ,4,5,4
"Dr. switch me to Glipizide due to allergic reaction to various vendors version of Generic Metformin.  The side effects caused by Glipizide include high blood sugar spikes, appetite suppression to which I ate one meal a day which in turn caused dizziness and fatigue,  severe constipation which caused nausea  and abdominal pain, constant thirst which led to water retention which led to bloating and painful swelling. Due to the swelling around my neck and the tingling sensation that I began to feel from my swelling feet all the way to left side of the chest, I discontinued using Glipizide.  Began drinking cinnamon tea with no sugar to keep blood sugar level in control then went to Mexico to buy Glucophage to control my diabetes.  So far I have no problems with Glucophage.  I think the side effects from Glipizide might have killed my aunt, she starved to death and was in constant pain from the swelling. I wish I would have taken the drug before she did I would have realize the side effects and taken her off Glipizide.",5,1,1

"I was taking Glucotrol XL 10 MG for about 7 years and was doing very well until  they developed a generic version. Pfizer makes the Brand and Greenstone which is a subsidiary of Pfizer makes the Generic version Glipizide XL 10 MG.  I took this for approximately 1 month and developed stomach pain, it did not bring down the sugar levels, and the pill was coming out whole in my bowel movement. I was put back on the Glucotrol and was doing okay until recently.  Now I am getting the same symptoms as when I was taking the Glipizide.  The Glucotrol Pill spelled out Glucotrol 10 which was Made by Pfizer, while the glipizide said GXL 10 on the pill Made by Greenstone a subsidiary of Phizer.  The last three times I ordered the Glucotrol, I have been getting a pill marked GXL 10 in a bottle that says it was made (distributed) by Pfizer and I am now getting the same symptoms as I was getting when I took the Generic Glipizide.  I am thinking they no longer make the Brand name and are sending me the one Marked GXL 10 with Glucotrol XL on the bottle.  I am also paying $90. for a three month supply, as opposed to a $5.00 charge it would be  for the generic pills.",3,1,1
Does anyone know the manufacturer of this drug?,5,3,3

Actually I feel that the drug has made no significant difference in my treatment. I have taken it for years along with metformin. I took metformin alone for years before adding the glipizide and my blood sugar numbers and A1C's have turned out basically at the same levels.,5,4,3
I recently started taking glipizide5mg again. First time my blood spikes were to low..dropping to 60 then back to 250. We cut the dose to half a pill and I take it half hour before each meal. Readings have been 200 before and average 120-160 after. This of course depends on what you eat too. Don't expect big results if you are eating fast food or high sugar meals. By changing my diet I'm hoping this will work. As for a1c testing ; I just started and I'm 8 right now..we will see how effective this is in 3 months. I'll be back! ;),5,3,3

I realized, after being seen by other doctors, that treating Type 2 Diabetes isn't an exact science. I cut out a  most soda and other sugary intake, and added more exercise. Blood sugar around 130. By the the way, an extensive study was done by doctors, it heard on the news about a year ago, that a  Type 2 diabetic's normal is different than a non diabetic's normal.It showed that some Type 2 Diabetics actually died as a result of reducing a Type 2 Diabetic's blood sugar level to that of a non Diabetic's.

"This medication taken 1/2 hour before breakfast has kept my A1C normal and I really can eat anything my wife prepares. The only thing I have to give up is sugar. If I feel I must sweeten something, I use Splenda. This has worked for 15 years. I was on Metformin before, but it didn't work nearly as well for me. If I am very active, I may have to eat some sweets, since anytime my glucose drops into the 80s, I will begin to feel weak and if drops into the 70s, I will feel clammy and then I have to eat something sweet so I take a candy bar and that is a treat for me.  I am more than happy with the results I get while using Glipizide.",5,5,5

"Taking 5 mg in the a.m. along with 1000 mg metformin 2x daily.Has brought my blood sugars down very well. Have had hypoglycemia with them. You have to eat at proper times. Started taking 9/1/10, have gained 7.5 lbs by 9/16/10. Exercise for 1 hour 5-7x a week and try to watch carbs. Hoped metformin would mitigate any tendency to gain weight (also hypothyroidism and this does not help on the weight front). I'm already overweight & waint to lose 50 lbs. Had lost 8 lbs recently with a lot of hard work. Not happy over this. Also have edema, headache, forgetfulness, nausea and very gassy, too. Not sure what to do as most drs. say pills won't cause weight gain then get mad when you gain weight and question them. My G.P. questions wisdom of taking glipizide long term as it can ""burn out"" your pancreas.  I'm trying to avoid insulin and weight gain. Over past few years have taken Avandia (massive weight gain), Starlix (unable to lose any weight despite heavy exercise schedule and diet), Januvia (stops stomach contents from emptying - for a month at a time even with lots of laxatives and had no effect on lowering blood sugars.) Just so tired of this disease. Any meds that help lower sugars cause too many other problems. Good luck to everyone.",4,3,4

The swelling eased somewhat, but blood sugars shot up.  Now I don't think glipizide did much to lower blood sugars.  I take it, but I think I need to get the doctor to try something else.

I started with one doctor and have had another for a couple of years.  He on the other hand feels I should and do take glucophage before bed because sometimes when I rise in the AM my test is 120-125 but for the most part it is low.  I usually stay close to 100 after lunch, dinner may keep me 125 and then go down.  I noticed that when I'm very upset my sugar is elevated to 140. Later I calmed down and my test was back to 105. I watch it pretty close.  So all in all, I've been very satisfied with my medication.",5,5,5

i had some bowel movement until my body got adjust. now i am fine with it my blood sugar is great. alone with eating right.,5,5,5
"I am highly satisfied with this medication, though I have been fortunate with only minor side effects. However, I would like to note that if you do not have insurance or good prescription coverage, you can get these medications as 2 separate pills for MUCH less. The combo pill as listed costs approx $60/30 days, while you can get the separate pills (though you have to eat 2 pills vs just 1 at a time) for $4/30 days each which x2 = $8/30 days vs $60/30 for the exact same medicine.  I checked this price at Target / Walmart but may be available elsewhere for similar savings. So be sure to let your Dr know when they are writing the prescription.  Just thought this might be helpful to other newly diagnosed diabetics who are counting their pennies like me.",4,4,4

"When I was diagnosed with diabetes, I initially had a blood sugar level lof 380.  My doctor prescribed the glipizide/metformin combination because he mentioned it was highly effective with other patients, especially his younger patients like myself.  With proper diet and exercise, it is quite an reliable medication.  It did cause diarrhea, but that side effect only lasted until my body was familiar with the medication.  In my case, the diarrhea lasted for a week or so - off and on . . . not every day.  From my initial blood sugar of 380, I am now able to maintain the levels between 80 and 150.  I have been on the medication for a few months now, and believe it does what it is supposed to.  Anyone who has or have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should highly consider this option.  But with any prescription medication, talk to your doctor about your concerns.",5,4,4

SO I see the nurses at the hospital the next day and ask for them to ask for me. The nurse confirms and says doctor wants you to take twice a day as discussed.

"I was taking glyburide 1.25 mgs in the morning with 500 mgs or metformin twice daily. Was able to drop to once daily and keep my levels in the 80-150 range.  When I didn't eat in the morning it would drop to 70 and I would get the shakes.  I also noticed bloating and my vision would get very blurry.  I stopped the glyburide and just stayed on the Metformin 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night.  My levels were always high 200-mid 300 range, although my eyes were better.  I am going back on the glyburide, can't seem to control my levels even with diet.  Also before starting this regimen my AC1 was in the mid- 9's. and immediately dropped to mid-6's and maintained this while I was on glyburide and metformin.  ",5,4,5
It is definitely keeping my glucose under control.  But I am convinced that it is causing weight gain.  Do you have other reports of that?,3,4,4
Has not lowered blood sugar at all,4,1,1
Med started out virtually stopping high blood sugars but as time goes on the med has become less and less effective even after doubling the dose from 10mg/day to 20mg perday over a 3 year period.,5,3,3
"Legs and feet swelling, can't get shoes on.",5,2,2
"I also take Levothyroxine (100 mcc) daily and I experienced hair loss, depression, was cold all the time and I was tired.  When I stopped taking Glyburide these problems went away. Is this usual?",4,1,4
"It worked for me in the beggining. I found out I was allergic to Metformin, had to stop taking that. Now the Glyburide is not working so well. Now taking Lantis (injections) once a day.",5,3,3
Was previously on metformin also but had to be dropped due to potential problem with kidneys.  I think the conflict resulted from being put on coumadin. ,4,5,4
I WAS ON GLYBURIDE BUT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS ABNORMAL,3,2,3
"Been taking 2 tabs 2x aday for over 2 yrs, worked well at first, dr added 1000mg metformin & they worked well for about a yr, now its in the high 200 to 400 & my meter is saying ketones, looks like the needle for me.....",4,2,3
"2x500mg Metformin & 2x 5mg Glyburide gives me good control, often have to eat more if I exercise too much!",5,5,5
was put on the drug after a bout with congestive heart failure.  Was using pygliestone,5,3,2
"I, too, have had a problem with sugar level dropping to low, even on just 5MG of Glyburide in morning. Having a 15g of carb snack 1 1/2 hr after taking helps to level out sugar & prevents the jittery feeling.   ",5,5,5
Taking Glyburide brought my blood sugar levels way down but also caused me to bloat and gain weight very quickly and extreme fatique so I have quit taking it.,5,1,5
Using this medication with glucophare has improved Blood Sugar control,4,5,4
I've bene taking this med since 1/09 and have had great results.  After being diagnosed in January I went through a period of depression and then action.  I am taking control of my diabeties and not letting it control me.  10mg Glyburide daily & 1000mg Met 2x daily.  I sometimes dip low but found if I eat something prior to or right after taking the meds my sugar stablizes.  ,4,4,4
Since taking the glyburide(5mg. in the morning) along with 1000 mg. metformin twice a day my blood sugars seem to be staying within normal range with no side effects.  I feel Awesome!,5,5,5
"The drug works to lower my blood sugar, but it lowers it too much. I'm tired all the time and my stomach aches for about 3 hours after I take it. I take 5mg every morning plus 500mg of Metformin ER twice a day. I am going to start breaking the glyburide in half and take it twice a day to see how that works. My doctor is on board with this.",5,2,3
it dosentseem to work,1,1,1
blood sugar too low,5,1,1
"to anybody who complains or stomache pains or cramping, I have found that if I take this with a  protein meal..this does not happen. Yogurt, oatmeal, whole wheat toast, eggs (egg beaters.",5,5,5
imy sugar count drops real low with  this medicine,4,4,4
I take 5mg twice a day along with 500mg of metformin twice a day. I was on avandia before but asked to be taken off because of health concerns. It is working just fine.,5,4,4
My blood sugars were in the mid 200's and now they range from 90-120 with no side effects.,5,5,5
found that drug does not work as well for me when i take it with cereal in the morning.,5,3,3
sugar count will not get under 170,4,1,1
I belive it causes my stomach to hurt.  I take this med before breakfast.  And every mirning I have stomach pain.  ,1,1,1
"My blood sugar is 108 and under but I feel horrible! Symptoms include stomach aches, headaches, and weakness. I feel very close to passing out. I'm not a big eater and this is a factor. Janumet 50/500 is also prescribed and I am asmatic and taking Advair. A change is in my future........ This is not working for me.",5,1,5
"i take 20mgs a day, that 4 pills along with 1000 mgs of metformin,2 pills.my glucose,sugar whatever is still around 250 when i wake up in the morning.i wont eat anything after 6pm.doc says i'm at the max in medication so i expect to go on insulin soon.costs about $1 everytime i check my sugar so i have to stop checking so often.Having diabetes isn't cheap even with wal-marts $4 drug plan.pills for gout,acid reflux,blood pressure...wish i could go back in time to tell myself to lay of the soda pops etc.",4,2,2
  have taken it both in morning or at night . it seems to work better for me when take it at night. Thinking of asking dr if maybe spliting dose to take half in morning and half at night. Also on actos plus medform.,4,4,4
this med. has helped me control my type 2 diabetes..But i also take actos along with it.,5,5,5
"Have been taking 1.25mg twice a day for the past 2 years.  I am not on a strict diet, but my food intake now includes a lot of non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli and dark greens (all types) and nuts & legumes.  I also stopped drinking sodas and now drink plenty of water.  This combined with an hour of aerobic exercise 4 days per week has decreased body weight by 50 lbs, and lowered my cholesterol and blood pressure too.  Exercising and losing the weight especially around my tummy area really made a big difference as my body is able to process the medicine and food more efficiently.",5,4,4
"I have encounter no problems with this medicine.  I unlike others who have rated this medicine, I only take this and I take 10 mg twice a day and my sugar levels have been between 80 and 110 for the last 2 months",5,4,5
"I was prescribed Actos along w/ glybuteride 10 m taken together they gave such a bad underarm odor I've  originally stopped taking them tog.  I now stopped glybuteride altogether as 2 hrs later, my sugar dropped so severely, i felt like jello and weak.  Tried several ways ie: different times with a bit of food later on,  of taking same result it's no good for me. Taking just Actos now reaction isn't as bad 2 hrs later.",5,1,2
Lowered my levels 40 points from an average of 110 to 70. Taken in conjunction with glucotrol.,5,4,5
first couple days shuar all over the place  489 to 500 now down to 125   145 ,5,3,2
I take glyburide 2.5 mgs and metformin 500 mgs both twice a day. glyburide at 9 a.m and 5 p.m. and the metformin at noon and 9 p.m. I've adjusted my eating habits to 3 small meals daily and a nighttime snack. My glocose levels now run between 70 and 140 all the time---very seldom does it go over 150. For me these 2 drugs combined work great. eating 3 small meals a day helps keep low sugars under control and has also helped me to lose some weight as well,5,5,5
I don't like taking glyburide becaus I blood sugar drops to low.,1,1,4
"I advise everyone taking oral meds for diabetes to be VERY concerned about serious, long-term side effects, and to discuss ALL possibilities with your doctor -- particularly liver damage (cirrhosis), which my partner is now confronting, possibly thanks to these meds (he doesn't drink and he's never had hepatitis). As much as possible, try to control your diabetes through diet and exercise.",5,2,4
"I started out on 1.25 mg daily and now I am up to 20mg daily and my blood sugars are still in the 200-400 range.  I am also on januvia, diet and exercise.  It is very frustrating!!",5,1,1
"Initially it was not working at all. Since the addition of metformin 500 mg, my levels are now getting under control.",4,3,3
so far my diabetics is up anddown. i also take metformin 500 is this ok?,5,5,5
I have had the same results as the first reviewer.  My blood sugars rarely drop below 200 anymore.,5,1,1
I am taking 4 diabeta along with 1/2 metformin and a januvia a day and my sugar will not go below 200. Is this too much med.,4,1,1
My doctor wanted to put me on insulin.  I am taking this drug with januvia.  I am on the lowest dose and it works all day.  The only thing I dislike is my blood sugar drops very quickly in the evening and I have to be ready.  But it works like clockwork.  ,5,5,5
"I thought that the glipizide was bad. Dr. prescb. 2x5mg b4 breakfast. By lunch time couldn't stand up straight. Giant pain lower back, left hip. Took 2 more next morn just to be sure. 3rd day none,zero. 4th day glad I stopped. The dream state is gone,the pain is lingering but no where near what it was. gonna have to find something else. Glipizide was bad but not as bad.",3,1,1
No side effect and has worked in combination with two other drugs.,5,5,5
Some what works with my blood suger. Frequent urination,3,3,3
"Have recently increased daily dosage from 10 to 15 mg/day.  At the same time, I have taken metformin out of my treatment due to some problems with diverticulitis and gaseous conditions.  Glucose level has increased slightly, so am going to 20 mg/day dosage.  All of this has been at the directions of my physician.",4,3,3
my dr. uo the dose. the reson i don't no. my aic is allways good,4,4,4
This drug for Diabetes has worked really good and I feel confident with the medication.,5,5,5
"Has lowered my sugars to under 120 with metformin also the only problem I am having is that I have sever sugar drops at least 3 times a week. Doctor has cut me down to 1/2 tab with the metformin. Will see what happens with the sugar drops now,",5,4,5
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,4,2,3
put on 1.25mg/day after trying actos for 6 wks. had sevear side effects with no effect on sugar levels (stayed at 155). so went on glyburide. on it for a month so far and its been great. sugar at 120-130 with no side effects.best part is this required no change in diet or exercise.,5,5,5
Glybrde hasallowed me to ower my blood sugars along ith my insulin.  You need to make sure you have eaten some food because it may cause low blood sugars.  I have NO side effects.,5,5,5
Wish there was a pill form ,1,3,4
"ER gave an injection to relieve constricted / possibly obstructed esophagus and difficulty swallowing, combined with a nitro pill under the tongue.  Was very effective (relieved the constriction and allowed swallowing within 5 minutes), but within 24 hrs caused a severe rash on right arm, left hand, groin, and toes. Rash has persisted for over 10 days.",1,1,5
"Severe stomach pain, Had multiple testing and found no illness or reason for pain. Still checking other options.I have stopped meds to see if this helps. Dr. hasn't considered that this may be the reason for pain. It has been 3 months in pain, so I decided to try stopping this medication to see if it is the cause.",3,1,1
After trying many drugs this one worked for me ! Thank goodness ! ,5,5,5
Works well to help control glucose spikes after meals. Very expensive for people on fixed income. Need a good generic.,3,3,3
"I have reson to believe that Humalog insulin is being created to work less effectively than other types of ""R"" insulin.  The amount of insulin that is required to drop my insulin 100 pts in blood glucose is nearly 10.  I think there's a game being played by the manufacturer ...  ",5,1,1
The pen sticks making it short and causes highs. My daughter's numbers are suffering and has been hospitalized. My insurance is forcing us to use this and not what works for my child. ,1,2,2
"Get sick from Humalog.  Within a day start to feel sick to stomach then two days start having headaches.  Old insulins (beef/pork) worked so much better too.  Apedra works much better than Humalog but it is not ""formulary"".  Now with new insurer (Blue Cross MN) they require a two week review before I can get the med.  What?  Two weeks before a pharmacy can give a diabetic insulin.  Really?",4,1,1
This has worked very good for me. I use it in a pump and can get 3 days without a change. I was on pills and then went to the pens. When they didn't do the job i went with a lower strength insulin with the pump. Now I use the U500 and it works great. If you can when you start injecting insulin with a syringe get the pump if you can.,5,5,5
wondering if there are any side effects to users?,3,3,3
"Humalog is a very good drug to control high blood sugar when used correctly.In my case, I rely on it to counteract overeating sweets, a mistake on my part.",4,4,4
"Have been type one since for 21 years, a pumper since 2010 with Novalog. Got laid off in 2011 and had to have bad insurance assistance that only covered Humalog. I had blurred vision after every bolus with normal BS for hours, nauseated, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, hard to breathe, fatigued, huge raw rash all over my shoulders, lost hair in huge amounts, thought I had cancer. Was not as effective as Novalog so I went into DKA twice in 3 months. Got good insurance so got my Novalog back. Will never take Humalog again. ",3,1,2
"Found out late in life that I was a diabetic, started out with Metformin and then quickly moved to pen form insulin. I hated having to do the four times a day shots along with six times a day finger pricks. My doctor suggested I think about using an insulin pump. I went to the required classes for the pump and got it. It is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I use about 200 units of humalog every other day. The average hourly dose is around 2.65 units. All I have to keep up with now is watching what I eat, and about twice a day finger sticks. ",5,5,5
"I test my blood sugar before or after eating, and before bed. I often eat very little after breakfast until suppertime. I take Humalog only. I was taking Lantus, but it was not going to be covered by my Part D and I could not afford it on my own. I did not notice any difference in my glucose or my A1c. ",5,5,5
I've noticed that the bladder used in the Humalog vial is very thick.  I have bent several needles trying to insert them into the vial.  Can't find an answer anywhere.  Hope someone has an answer for me. ,2,4,5
sometimes can't ever inject enough even though eating habits haven't changed from when I don't use nearly as much.,1,3,3
I am finding that my sugar levels have dropped greatly. I couldn't keep them under 200 and now my average is 120s. this has been a life saver for me.,5,5,5
"Eyes!  It's the eyes!  Metformin blinded me--distorted view, severe photophobia.  Glipizide did the same, with the addition of angina. Dropped those for a couple months. Eyes still not so good, but better than with Metformin or Glipizide.  Now Humalog, 1 unit, under 200,0r 2 units over 200, with meals. One week later I'm having a hard time even reading this enlarged print. Safe dariving speed on open highway is 40mph or less. Eyes can't respond to light changes, everything in sunlight all washed out, sky white. These drugs lowered my blood sugar but this is one hell of a high price to pay for it.  I keep looking on the net for reference to these eye problems and can't find anything except ""blurry vision"" once in awhile.  Before these drugs, with my high blood sugar, I could see, with corrected lenses, perfectly.  Had trifocals, and don't like those, but they worked.  Now, they're useless and I have to use 2X reading glasses to read anything.  TV pictures dim, without detail unless I'm right up on the screen.  What the heck is this all about?  Am I the only person having this kind of trouble.  No help from doctors.  Opthalmologists just want to laser my eyes or inject experimental drugs. What a way to go....",2,1,1
"Humalog works far better than my previous R insulin because it works more quickly. With R, I would inject just before a meal but would get post parandial highs that gave me a headache. It took 2.5 to 3 hours for R to start working. With Humalog, onset almost always cooincides with digestion so I get a better experience. I also end up with far fewer episodes of low blood sugar on Humalog than with R. My A1C has been in the low 6's since I started with Humalog where they had been in the low 7's with R. ",5,5,5
"I use Humalog as a 'correction' medication. Basically this means when my blood sugars are higher than usual, I bolus the dosage to bring levels back down.  My first time using it was last night when my 2 hour postprandial blood sugars jumped to 279. Within an hour after taking a shot, I dropped to 78. An hour and a half after that I was at 74.  I am EXTREMELY impressed as to how good this works for me. Only needed 3 units too.  Don't care for the 12mm needle. Will try the 8mm needle next time I am higher than usual.  I am hoping that between my diet and exercise, coupled with the Humalog, I can get even better blood sugars.  My last A1c about a week ago was 5.3, and that was with several spikes into the 200+ range, using diet and exercise alone. My goal is under 5.0 (4% club).  With this medication, I can vary my diet so it's not so boring, and not be forced to vigorously exercise as much to bring down blood sugars.  I am wondering something though: Will I gain weight? Lose weight? Or maintain my weight when using any form of insulin?  Don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to 'paying the piper' (AKA exercising) after I eat. I have a lot of trouble fitting the needed time in to do it, and an even harder time getting back down to normal after a 200+ spike, using diet and exercise.  I generally have no trouble lowering my BS if I am 160-180 range, or less.  My fasting blood sugars are usually perfectly normal.  I can see some semblance of a life now that I have this medication. I won't do pills for my diabetes treatment as my blood sugars are usually well controlled. Seems heat & humidity (or a nap after eating) spikes me highly.  I really hope & pray that the endo will continue letting me have this medication.  I like it better than Humulin R which is slower.   Maybe get Humulin R for long digesting carbs like Dreamfields, and Humalog for the 'eat-N-go' carbs.  I'm not one to want meds of any kind, but this one really works for me!",5,5,5
It works too fast at times like another person said before and sometimes i'm then treating a low!! but overall if taken at the right time it works awesome!!,5,3,5
"My humalog seems to get weaker, the last 2/3 of the bottle seem weak,,humalog 75/25",4,2,2
"Have been taking two insulins (Lantus) and Humalog now for three years.  The Humalog is with meals and the dosage depends on what my blood sugar reading is before I take it.  At diagnosis, my A1C was 13.2 and now is 6.0.  Both insulins have been a life saver for me.  I've been using the pen form and it is so easy to use.",5,5,5
I have a hard time with the dialing parts of the pen. It jams up on me sometimes.  I like my lantus pen better.  Easier to use.,4,4,4
"I've been on insulin only for a few months now. I take 25 units of Lantus once a day and Humalog, as needed. Lantus works, but Humalog is a waste of money and effort. Ten units of Humalog lowers the sugar by 10 points. I've been taking as much as 30-40 units with dinner alone over a 2-3 hours span, and still having a hard time keeping it under 200. What I would like to know if anybody knows the danger of overdosing on Humalog? Are there any negative effects on the other organs? Clearly, it does not do me any good using Humalog. I just wish my doctor would see that and stop insisting on it. Perhaps I should change the doctors.",5,1,1
"I have been type 1 since 1969, I was 5.  Insulin has come a long way.  I like humalog but it works too fast, I am a registered nurse and if I take it at work and something happens like a code for example, I hit the floor if I can't eat within a few minutes of injecting.  I prefer the plain old R over the Humalog only for this reason.  My last A1c was 5.7.",5,3,5
Hsving gotten on a sliding scale has been beneficial.,5,5,5
 For about a year this med worked well -- now it is not working -- i have increased the dosage with not very good results.,5,2,4
Humalog worked well for about a year but it is not working as well now.,5,3,2
"i have been a diabetic since 1969 when i was 32. this insulin replaced R insulin for me, it is wonderful in its speed, i am a chef, my life is centered around my meter & my shots & keeping myself balanced. my a1c reading last was a 5.6 was a testimonial to what i have written. i try to follow my diet,people can't understand when i spit out what i taste, like a sommelier,for me the taste is the important thing. that to achieve that, is what, i exist for.I mix my humalog with NPH for long lasting control. i take 2 or3 shots a day,depends on my self control.take the shotsit is nothingtoo be afraid of, as some people are.",5,5,5
was told lantus would be one shot a day and it is if i use 3 shots a day with humalog.  feel like a human pin cushion.  also take metformin twice a day.  seems like a lot of medicine and my average tests show around 156.,3,2,1
"I have been a type 1 diabetic for 25 yrs. I take Humalog at every meal and then Lantus at bedtime. I do have great results as long as I'm not sick, stressed, the weather doesn't change....ect. Humalog works great when everything in your life is working great to.   ",5,5,5

"I have been using the Humalog insulin pen for about 3monthes now and the Lantus solostar for 3monthes as well. They both work very well, they are quick to use and help very much. I would recomend them to anyone.",5,5,5
"I was diagnosed a year ago and have been on this and Lantus from the start.  I was underweight at diagnosis and gained 6lbs in the first couple of months; but I have maintained since then.  I am pleased with Humalog and the pens -- they allow me to be pretty discreet, they look like a big Sharpie marker.  My peak is also fairly predictable with Humalog.  ",5,5,5
" Since I started, I have gained weight and experience extreme bloating and constipation.  The doctor says that it should not be the Humalog but this did not happen until after I started Humalog",2,1,2
"I've gained 18 pounds since I've started using the Humalog Pen.  Not happy about that.  My feet & legs beome swollen when I'm at work.  My doctor doesn't think the insulin  is the cause, but it didn't happen until I started using it.  It controls my blood sugar, but not happy about the weight gain and swelling.",5,3,4
"I, too, have gained over 30 pounds after beginning this medication. My diet has been very limited and I am watching my carb intake very closely. Still - the weight gain has me extremely dissatisfied.   ",4,1,3
Ever since I started taking this I have gained about 30 lbs.  ,5,1,3
This drug is putting around 3-5 lbs a week weight on me. It's discouraging. When I started on it I was 241 lbs and now I am 281 lbs. I am absolutely not eating more. I watch what I eat closely. Plus for some reason my nighttime dose-55-frequently causes my sugar to crash. Once it went down to 43.,2,2,2
"I have been using Humalog 75/25 for approx 6 weeks, before breakfast and dinner. My  BS has decreased from 250-300 throughout the day to approx 150 between meals.  However, I have gained a few pounds.",4,4,4
"It's not bringing my blood sugars down, no matter what I eat or don't eat.  I'm slowly increasing dosages (per my doctor's instructions), but I'm still having high fasting blood sugar and it doesn't come down very much after injections. ",5,2,2
"Fasting blood sugar at 354 dropped to 104 on the first day itself. Had glycemic low of 68 in early morning -2:30 am for 2-3 days.

"I take this drug with metformin xr, 1000 mg twice per day.  Previously I took it with plain metformin and I started gaining weight, I was always hungry.

it help me 2 get back on track,3,3,3
I am suffering from type 2 diabetes for the last say 15 years and has been on oral medication and my blood sugar was in the range of 158 240. about a month back I was detected suffering from congestive heart failure and my Lvef was 22%. While on medication for chf my oral medication for D was discontinued and for diabetes I was given onlyone tablet of glimepiride 2mg. In the result my BS rose to about 240-300 range. I went to the endocronologist. He put me on homolog 50 mix 20 units and 15 units morning and evening and discontinued the oral dose. It did not act and my BS rose to 260-400 range and did not come down even after 10 days. I changed the endocronologist and now I have been put on Homolog 25 mix 10 units morning and evening and also one tablet of glimepiride 2 mg. Now after 3 days I feel no change in my Blood Sugar level. My experience is that Homolog has not acted on me. I shall be glad to know any experiences with Homolog.,5,1,1
"T1D 43 years. Humalog via pump and syringe work well. the Humalog U-100 Kwik pen is very inconsistent in performance often resulting in the inability to control my blood sugar from rising or matching carb counts. It can step ladder in how blood sugar comes down or how it attempts to control a blood sugar rise.  Humalog via a syringe or pump is much more predictable, and seems to be longer lasting.  I would not suggest the Kwik pen to anyone but feel Humalog delivered by other methods is a winner. ",3,1,2
"Patients using the Humalog Pen would benefit from a ""click"" as the units dispense like the Novolog and Sofi brands. The Kwikpen can misfire and one can be unsure of the delivered dose as a result.  ",2,2,5
"I have been taking insulin for 40  years and therefore have no problems with taking shots.  The Homolog KwikPen however, is the WORST insulin pen I have ever used when it comes to accurate dosing.  First, the amount of insulin delivered is variable on how hard one pushes, not on the stop position (unlike novonordisks or sanofi pens).  Second, the dosing ""arrow"" variably lines up with the dose amount. Finally, the gray blue color of the pen is not overtly distinguishable from the gray of lantus pens, making it possible to confuse the two (how about a bright and readily distinguishable homolog pen color, like the red lilly uses?).  The consequences if these two insulins are confused could have life threatening consequences.",4,1,4
"While the insulin itself works fine, the KwikPen is a disaster. It gets stuck and no more insulin can be dispensed way before the pen vial is empty. Has happened multiple times; many pens with half the insulin unused.",1,1,4
I use two types of insulin pens for use with Humalog and Toujeo.  The Humalog KwikPen by Lilly is difficult to use and not always accurate.  The Toujeo pen by Sanofi-Aventis is easy and accurate with each use.  I wish Humalog pens were produced by Sanofi-Aventis. For accuracy in injections the pen produced by Lilly falls short on quality. ,3,3,5
"While the medication works fine, the action of the pen is mushy and imprecise, dampening tactile feedback such that it is necessary to visually confirm that you have actually administered the full injection.  Having done so, the springback on the plunger appears to suck a substantial quantity of air into the insulin vial, necessitating a significant prime to make your next injection accurate.  In summary, the KwikPen wastes insulin, it raises concerns regarding backwash sanitation, it feels wrong in the hand, and accurate dosage is hit-or-miss.  It doesn't matter how good the medication is if the delivery is substandard – and the KwikPen is markedly substandard.  I had hoped to speak with Lilly Eli and Company about the shortcomings of their pen, but it turns out they are not a feedback-friendly organization, so I'll have to settle for warning others about this problem.",2,3,5
"I have been diabetic since age four, about 28 years. I've been on humalog forvprobably over 15 years. The product is awesome I just hate the flexpen!!!! I also take lantus in an insulin pen and their design and ease of use is 100% better than humalog. Humalog should take note and redesign. A lot of times I will inject and nothing will come out. Then retwist it and the entire thing will get stuck. Boo humalog",2,2,5

This drug works well for me.,5,5,5
"Taking 2009 mg Metformin. My blood sugars were all over the place, usually over 190. Was in hospital after surgery and Dr. put me on Humalog. Right now my BS is only 105. It has totally changed my life. Have not gained any weight as I walk it off. Have only had 2 spikes when I had to use more than 2 units. I am really happy with it.",5,5,5
"anyone who has trouble using this medication is PURE STUPID!       If you are finding it has Little to No affect at controlling your sugars maybe you are the one at fault for not cutting out JUNK FOOD!  and acting like you have some dam common sense!    I've seen several bad reviews on this drug based on Glucose Control Only....  People you need to Smarten up and stop acting like a bunch of Mindless Ass Holes!     If you wont do what your Doctors tell you to do and you wont even try  to Control your Diabetes through Diet and Exercise along with Medication,  and you have Higher than Normal Glucose Levels.  Then you deserve to Suffer!  Plain and Simple!",5,5,5
"I have been taking this medication for quite some time now.  My sugars had been regularly over 300, but are now 100-130 in the AM, and sometimes in the 90s.  I see a light rise in my sugars during the day, but only about +20-30 (which is normal).  The only hard part was getting used to injections, but since they are now a normal part of my day, it's really not a big deal.",4,4,4
"This product has worked magic with my blood sugar. I have been on it for about 5 mo's and after a period of ""figuring it out"" under docters direction it works teriffic. Dosage varies based on what I eat and carb intake. Couldn't be happier.",4,5,5
"Fasting high in the AM. Take Medformin 500 AM & PM. Dr. added Humalog 4 units (going to 5 units when eating cereal) breakfast, 3 units for lunch & dinner if I have Carbs. Working wonderfully. Been almost a month. Lantus at 8 PM 14 units to lower readings in the AM. First time since 1996 sugars low and not spiking. Concerned about low readings - having nightmares during my sleep. Had a couple last night, first time this month and this seems to be a pattern when adding meds with the Medformin and Lantus. Anyone else having nightmares??? Over all happy with results. No weight gain yet!!!",5,5,5
I have been on humalog for about 6 months now and have seen little results in my fasting blood sugar levels ,5,1,2
"Started taking Humalog 3 weeks ago.  Dose 10 units 3 times daily along with one dose of 15 units of Levermir at bedtime, and one 1000mg metformin in morning and one in evening.  BS has dropped from low 300's down to mid 100's during that time, but, I have gained easily 10 pounds without changing my diet at all.  Hopefully BS numbers will continue down, and the weight will ultimately do the same!",5,3,4
I have been using this product for at least 5 years in the 9 years that I have been diabetic Im 16 and have type one so this insulin is obviously working,5,5,5
Just started on Humalog3 times a day(low dose of course) on a sliding scale.  I use it along with 20U of Lantus at bed time.  Also 100mg of Januvia daily. Noticed some facial flushing. Not bad at all  I will keep you posted on my progress.,5,1,1
"Placed on Humalog/Lantus 6 months ago. Had fasting BS of 380-500. Now have fasting BS of 210-250. 160 units daily with little effect. Hit donut hole and pharmacy wants $225 per 5 pack. Without supplemental Medicare, donut hole cost is $555.30. Who can afford this? Will have to end diabetes meds due to extremely high cost, and only minor results.",2,2,2
"I started using humalog and lantus about 6 wks ago.  I've been very happy with my bs levels.  From a bs level of over 275 routinely, my numbers have ranged from 112-139 upon waking, and within normal range throughout the day.  The biggest drawback has been the weight gain; I went from 187 to 198, which was very disappointing, as I had already been trying to lose wt.  My healthcare provider has just taken me off the insulin injections and put me on amaryl.  ",4,4,5
"My diabetes was not under control, for a couple of years. Since I've got humalog and along with my lantus it seems to have start to become under control. I switched to a new doctor and it is becomeing under control. Its a shame that my old Dr. did not see this.",5,3,4
"I have tried a lot of different Insulins and this is the only one I seem to be able to take. All of the pills and shots have made my stomach swell out a lot!!! I asked the dr. why, and she said it's a side effect.  When I was on the pills my sugar dropped constantly. I see other people complain about gaining weight too. What a bummer!! Have changed my eating habits, but does not seem to help much.",5,3,4

It now appears these drugs are nottotally compatible and I am suffering from the interactions and I am now seeking alternative medications to help controlmy problems.  Can you suggest alternatives?

I started taking 200 mg of Invokana a day and lost 10lbs and brought my A1C from 9 to 8. Then after about 2 years it stopped working and I was put on 300mg and lost another 10 lbs. A year later and my A1C is going back up and have to add Trulicity once a week and Doctor upped my Glimepiride from 2 mg to 4 mg. I had no side effects with Invokana but you have to drink a lot of water with Invokana cause thatâ??s how you get rid of the sugar. Hopefully no side effects from the Trulicity.,5,3,5

My cardiologist put me on Omega 3s and with the invokanna, my triglycerides have fallen from 350 to 120.  I've had no more side effects at all.  As an aside, I also take glucotrol every morning and night, but it was failing to work on my morning sugars or control my A1c. I am very, very happy that so far, I am able to control my bg much better. I'm only one 100 mgm before breakfast. So far, so good! ",5,5,5
"I have been taking Invokana 100mg for almost two months now and have really started to see in improvement in my blood sugar levels. I am following a low-carb diet and so far I have lost 17 lbs.

"I was very skeptical of taking this at first because of the side effects. I started taking it and so far so good. No side effects, I also have been taking them with cranberry pills to help as a precaution from the side effects. I haven't had my A1C checked yet, however my daily blood sugars have gone from mid 200's to low 100""s and I feel a little better. sometimes it goes a little low and I get the symptoms of low blood sugar, but I just snack a little and I feel fine. it's always scary reading the reviews of what every thinks and says, because you don't how it's going to inner act with your body and the medication your already taking. I also take metformin and glyburide and insulin and I have cut back and some days I don't take them all because of fear of too low blood sugar. so, it's still early in my fight to be under and in control of my sugar, but I'm still fighting.

Talked to dr.and he explainex completely normal because my body is  to high sugar. 2 weeks later, no side effects. Headaches gone, feel good  and blood sugar averages 150 or less. On a low carb eating plan. Looking forward to see what blood sugar will be in another 2 weeks! Mood is great and walking daily.",5,5,5
"Worked well with lowering my A1C from 9.0 to 5.7. I have been on this for over a year. Then I started having severe UTI's with bloody urine. Yeast infections are a problem.  Being tried on another med because of UTI's. I wish I could stay on it, but must the side effects are becoming too severe. Mild weight loss with this meds too. You need to be stay at home or at a profession where you can go to the restroom a lot! ",4,3,4
I have been on this Med for over 6 months with no noticeable side effects.  A1c dropped from 7.1 to 6.2.  Haven't had a real noticeable weight loss but I am an admitted carbaholic.  Still working on the diet and hope to get off the meds eventually.,5,5,5
"I've been taking for a little over a month and a half.   I lost 8 lbs, in the first month, my fasting blood sugars have dropped from the 160s to the low 90s.  Mid day and pre/post meal numbers have dropped from around 190s to the 120s.  No problems with UTI so far.  Drinking 120 oz of water/day (three 40oz hydroflask bottles).  I am waking in the night once or twice to use the bathroom so, not sleeping as well (more time spent in a REM (dreaming) state).  First month on 100mg/day. Currently on 200mg/day after cutting glyburide in half.  Couldn't be happier with the reduction in blood sugar numbers.  Plan is to continue to take invokana and come off the glyburide completely(metformin also hopefully)",5,5,5
"At first, I suffered from increased UTI's but that subsided over 3-6 months.  Lost 10 pounds and A1C dropped from 11.2 to 7.0 over six months.  I do get up at least once each night to urinate, but a lot of that is due to my increased intake of water to stay hydrated.  Overall I am pleased with this drug and have had minimal side effects.",5,4,4

I started taking this in December. I am down 30 pounds and eating and drinking normal. ,5,5,5
blood sugar levels have in approved.  but constantly having yeast and bladder infections.  also nausea.,4,3,4
I have taken this drug for over a year now and my A1C under control and easier to manage.  Currently I take  Invokana with Janumet each day and my A1C has consistently been at 5.5.  These results were not instant and took about 6-9 months to acheive.  I have also lost about 2-3 pounds per month totaling just over 50 pounds and weight loss began immediately.  I did have suffer from a UTI once I began using the drug but that problem has since gone away. A side effect I noticed because of weight loss is now I am no longer taking any BP medicine as this is managed.  So far life is good as we continue to monitor my results and tests.,5,5,5
"My physician added Invokana 100 once daily to my 75/25 60 units of insulin twice daily. After 3 to 4 days I began experiencing sever stomach upset and discomfort in the upper mid and right side of my abdomen with nausea, dry heaves, sweating, SOB; overall feeling not well. The symptoms come on suddenly and seem associated with sudden hunger. The severe symptoms resolve quickly if I eat or drink immediately. I've had the same symptoms with other oral diabetic meds like Metformin and Bydureon.",1,1,1
"I am type 1 but asked my MD to let me try it.  I lost almost 20 pounds in 6 months without trying but I did have frequent urination, excess thirst and yeast infections.  My A1C improved somewhat.  100 mg once daily.  Now my weight is going back up quickly, as well as my A1C.  Does it just stop working after a period?",5,3,4
I HAVE BEEN TAKING INVOKANA 100MG FOR ABOUT 17 MONTHS AND IT HAS WORKED GREAT. I LOST 25LBS AND MY WEIGHT IS STILL ON TRACT.MY AC1 WAS 11.2 NOW IT'S 6.9. THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING IS ME KEEPING A BLADDER INFECTION OR UTI.I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE MEDS BUT MY DOCTOR SAID I CAN'T KEEP TAKING ANTIBOITICS. THE MEDS WORK.,5,4,5
"I see a lot of comments about adverse effects of frequent urination, loose bowels, yeast infections, excessive thirst...This medication enables your kidneys to filter out the glucose in your system. This is not a normal kidney function. This medication is meant to aid you not do all the work for you. You are thirsty and pee a lot because your kidneys are working overtime to release the glucose. Yeast infections occur due to peeing out the glucose. I've been taking invokana for 6 months, I use cranberry vitamin and have never had a yeast or bladder infection. I only get loose stools if I hate something I shouldn't such as grease, excessive sugar or fatty meals. Eating a healthy diet and incorporating exercise in has eliminated all side effects, I still pee a lot and drink as much as I can, this medication will over work your kidneys thus leading to dehydration. Drink plenty of water and you will be fine. Eat better, exercise, don't use it as a band-aid while continuing unhealthy habits. Of course results will be different for everyone but I assure you, following these simple steps will help you achieve your goals. Stay Strong!!",5,5,5
This medication has worked wonders for me. I have been on the medicine for about 1 month and My HA1C came down from a 12.4 to a 7.9!!!!!! To God be the glory with chanbge of eating and exercise. ,5,5,5
I have been a diabetic for over 10 years and have never been able to lower my A1C. My numbers increased from the start until my PCP put me on Invokana. My last reading before being put on this medication was past 8.0. I have been on it for almost 6 months and my A1C has dropped to 6.6. This is the first time my A1C ever went down. I do have to urninate more than before but if my A1C is finally getting under control I don't mind. ,5,5,5
"I have been taking Invokana for 1 1/2 years now I have lost 50lbs,although I make 4 to 5 trips a night to the bathroom, I am completely happy with the results of my A1C",5,5,5
Have been taking for 3 weeks. Have noticed decrease in BS at various times througout the day. Missed one day and noticed elevated blood sugar. Side effects are increased urination and subsequent thirst. Causes you to drink more water which is good for you anyway. Lost about 4 pounds.,5,5,5
I took 100mg 2x a day for almost 2 weeks and did not have a blood sugar reading under 200. I then went up to 300mg 2x a day and my blood sugar readings got worse. I drank fluids like there was no tomorrow and went to the bathroom constantly. I would get so light headed in the mornings that I could hardly function. My doctor can't believe that I had so many issues because all his other patients are doing great on it but I would not recommend this drug to anyone. I was miserable.,1,1,1
"I took invokana for about six months, The drug made me urinate often and I did loose about 4 lbs. I was recently treated for a irregular heartbeat and had to have an ablation of my left ventriculle. I have since stopped the med after my surgery, I never had heart issues until I took this drug and I feel this made have been the catalyst to my irregular heart beat symptoms ",4,1,1
I have been on 300 milligrams for 3 months.  I have been a diabetic for 20 years.  With 2000 milligrams of metformin I got my a1c down from 8.1 to 6.8.  Over time metformin looses effectiveness.  I lost 13 lbs.  Only side effect is increased urination which will go down over time.  I have less yeast infections as well.  I am very pleased with this drug so far.,5,5,5
"Been on for almost a year - A1c has went from 11.4 to 7.8.  First time a medicine has helped.  I have occasionally have to do a bathroom run in the middle of the night, but otherwise no side affects.  300mg dosage.",5,4,5
"It worked well the first three months I was on it but starting this last month I started emitting gross looking mucous from my bowels.  Then ended up super constipated and I was cleaned out I started having more gross mucous ranging from white to light brown to completely bloody. Have been to emerg 4 times where doctors have done numerous blood tests, abdominal xrays, etc.  All results have come back negative so the doctors only conclusion is that it has been caused by the Invokana.  I have now been completely off of it for nine days but am still experiencing the mucous evacuation, low grade fever which leaves me soaked by morning, etc.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to take this experimental drug which was given me by my diabetic Nurse Practitioner.  My life has been a living hell this last month and hopefully once this drug is out of my system I will have no further reprocusions from it.",3,1,2
This med made my stomach upset. Was going to the bathroom a lot at night. At least 3 to 4 times. I did loose about 5lbs. Terrible yeast infections. A1c did go up. on it for only 3 months    ,3,3,3
"My blood sugars have never gone over 6.9 and taking this pill has made my blood sugars 21.9, fasting, this meds is not helping my blood sugar or Hbalc level. Not working on my weigh eigher, makes me urinate a lot",5,1,1
Been taking this med for 2 months and first symptom is heavy thirst.  Dropped a few pounds but that reversed. Many trip to the bathroom during waking hours.  Recent warning for Ketoacidosis but have not test to confirm.  May stop med after this round runs out.  ,5,3,3
"my BS went from 180 [fasting] to 110 average, so it works, but expect to get up three times a night to urinate and the cost is a BIG factor if you have no insurance it costs $414.00 for 30 pills, (one per day)b ut they definitely work, (I got off after two months)",5,4,5
"I have been on Invokana for 3 months.  Initially I had recurrent low blood sugars.  Currently, I experience low blood sugars in the morning after taking it but then throughout the day my sugars become high after trying to raise them to a safe level.  I have begun having severe itching all over my body, loss of bladder control, nausea, and weakness in my legs.  All reasons that I am going to stop this medication and explore alternative.  The itching is the worst and nothing alleviates it so this medication is a goner.",5,1,4
Beware you will lose bladder control with this medication to the point that you will pee in your pants.  Also makes you very thirsty.  I took it for a few weeks and will not take it again.,4,1,1
I have just started taking med hope it works without any problem. will come back in few weeks and let you know how it work. don't like taking new med. but I do trust my Dr. If you read review here makes you not want to take this med. my A1c is 6.7 need to be lower and need to lost weight 399   ,5,4,4
"A1C dropped from 9.5 to 6.6 in less than two months. As a result I'm no longer taking insulin. It did lower my blood pressure, so I was able to get off BP meds as well. I'm very pleased with how it's working for me!",5,5,5
The FDA has issued a warning. But my wife wasn't warned and it isn't listed as a side effect. However using this drug can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis which is suppose to be rare in type 2 diabetics. Please be aware of the symptoms and seek medical attention of you have any of the side effects. Talk with your doctor about this FDA warning and please take it seriously. My wife spent 4 days in the ICU along with another patient also on Invokana.,4,1,4
"I have been taking this med for 4 months.  In that time my A1c has dropped from 9.3 to 7.3!  I also lost 5 pounds. I haven't had any yeast infections but I've never been prone to them.  Maybe eating yogurt nearly every day helps this.  Only side effects are frequent large voids, slight hypotension when I stand, and having to get up twice a night to urinate.  I'm willing to put up with this for the obvious benefits.",5,5,5
"I have been using this medication for 6 months. It worked well in helping to reduce my AIC, but I just hate the vaginal bacterial infections. I read that after 6 months of using the medication the infections will subside. I still get them. I do take a pro-biotic tablet, but it's not that strong. I will try taking some of the expensive Ultimate Flora Women's Complete 90 Billion pro-biotic tablets that I read about on this site. Hopefully they will help eliminate the bacterial infections. Drink plenty of water because you can experience dehydration really fast. I have noticed that my weight stays down with this medication. I take the Invokana 300mg and Humalog + Lantus.",5,4,4
"I am always scared when I take any new meds, after I took Invokana, I felt the change in my body, I was a little fatigued for a week, but got adjusted to it.  After a month and a half of taking it, my daily clucose readings are lower and  I lost over 11 pounds and I never felt better.  I like this medication a lot, it has drastically changed my life. ",4,5,5
"I had the typical yeast infection at the 100 mg dosage.  When I went to the 300 mg dosage, I began to have terribly servere and painful leg and foot cramps almost immediately every single night.  I did not have uninterrupted sleep for the entire time I took this drug.  I think it is very dangerous, causing severe dehydration which, even after 3 weeks off the drug, I continue to experience.  And I drank a ton of water. ",4,1,2
"I highly suggest avoiding this medication if you possibly can. I was hospitalized for a week due to a poor reaction to this medication. I met numerous doctors as I was the first person in my general area of the country to have had the reaction. Thankfully I'm young so I managed to survive. I was told had I been 50 or more, I would've died. I had a severe amount of acidity in my blood, was acute ketoacidosis and I was in diabetic shock. Took Invokana for a month in a half approx. by the time it happened. There was no other causes of my ketoacidosis. It did help lower my sugar though. And normally I don't have negative reactions to medication. If you really need to take Invokana, I highly suggest purchasing ketone test strips at your local pharmacy and keep an eye on your keytone levels in your urine to hopefully catch ketoacidosis before it hits. If that's even remotely possible. But if you can take anything else, I would suggest doing so. And I'm not one to spread around fear in others. It is really a genuine warning. Please be careful when taking this medication, especially if you have other health conditions or are older in age. I almost died as it was and I'm 29 years old. But hey, if you've been taking it for a while, it works and nothing happened.. then great! Doesn't mean ketoacidosis will happen to everyone. But it can. As to why I'm posting my review. Take care everyone.",4,1,2
My a1c was 9.9 now its 7.0. Wonderful drug! I am up at night urinating but thats a small price to pay for good blood sugar. Metformin gave me shortness of breath and chest pains. I also take glipizide for my sugar. I am very happy with this med.,5,5,5
"I took this drug for 5 days and the side effects were horrible.  My doctor switched me to farxiga and that was even worse with side effects.  I thought I would end up in the ER from the pounding, racing heart.  I am back on my previous meds and feeling much better.  ",5,1,3
Up till now it is satisfactory ,4,4,4
"My A1C was 10.9 now down to 7.0.......highly pleased, no side affects, all other blood work great.",5,5,5
"Doesn't work for someone with a history of UTIs. I took it for 6 months and I was miserable. My BS were reduced considerably but at what cost. For diabetics, quality of life is very important. I stopped taking it when I realized that my kidney function tests were staring to deteriorate. Practice caution and compare previous results. Create a Google alert to make sure you don't miss any new info about its side effects. The FDA has issued a warning and Health Canada is investigating it.",5,1,3
good my A1c went to 6.2 blood sugar in good range  i am concerned and confused by all the negative info coming out now new FDA warning would appreciate more reliable info about this drug i am on metformin also,4,4,4
"using it for 5 weeks in conjunction with metformin and januvia, blood sugar is down 60-100 points!",5,5,5
"I was on 2 types of insulin. Taking Invokana has completely taken me off insulin. It does make me urinate frequently, but I'll take that over injections anytime!",5,5,5
"I have tried everything from oral medication to insulin in attempt to control the blood sugar. When my a1c went up to 11, my MD prescribed Invokana. There was an immediate improvement in the blood sugar level. This medication worked wonders for me.",5,5,5
Raised my blood sugar does not work.  I did cut blood pressure drugs in half. Duretic portion is stronger than the part that elemenates sugar I guess,5,1,1
"62 yo female. I've been on everything actos, metformin (allergic which seems to happen w/ some people with shellfood allergies), Januvia, trajenta, glypizide. Nothing has worked well. My A1C has gone form 6.2 to 8.8 in 5 years. So MD started Invokana three days ago. So far I'm up all night in the bathroom, vaginal itching, UTI, tired, generally feel crummy AND blood sugars have increased from 140-170 to 200-300!! I'm not hungry and I do not need to lose weight! I'm 5'5"" and weigh 133. Not sure what to do as MD is away on vacation. I had high hopes for this drug. ",5,1,1
"Invokana was the worst drug I have ever taken. Caused dry mouth, which I could have dealt with & vaginal/genital itching & extreme pain & even swelling & I guess yeast infection, which I haven't head for years. I was on it for less than a week along w/Metformin. Acute agony from this med. I think it should be taken off the market.",5,1,1
only two weeks but so far so good reducing my blood sugar ,5,4,4
This medication has worked significantly better than any other medications I have been prescribed.  I have been diabetic for 3 years and my A1c is the lowest ever.  Side benefit - I have lost weight too.  Downside - be sure you drink lots and lots of water to avoid feeling ill.  So far I have not experienced any side effects other than minor dizziness - and that has only occurred when I didn't stay hydrated.,5,5,5
"While my blood sugar is not well under control after nearly 6 months on this medication, it has helped me lose 29 pounds.  Although side effects suggest that LDL can increase on Invokkana, my total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and LDL decreased significantly...like 21-25%!  I don't know if this will continue but my doctor decided to leave me on and add another medication to try to get the blood sugar down.  Other than urgency to urinate I have had no negative side effects.  I am on the 300 mg dose.",5,5,3
"39 year old female type two diabetic for 15 years. before Invokana A1c 10.5.  Have not hade a BS over 200 since starting this medication a month ago.  Have increased to 300. DO YOUR RESERACH. You MUST drink plenty of fluids or you will feel ill.  Also to combate the yeast ( I am extremly suseptable anyway) I take Ultra Flora 90 billion 12 strain probiotic EVERYDAY. I also suggest Oil of Oregano to help with the yeast. This medication is fantastic but women have been having issues tolorating it, so drink plenty of water and use a great probiotic. Ask your doctor for the saving card your medication will be zero for 12 months. ",5,4,5
"I have been on this drug(100mg) for almost 2 months. I am a type1 diabetic on no insulin. I eat vegetables, salads and lean meats. For breakfast I have a white egg omelet with mushrooms. I drink unsweetened almond milk.There is some genital irritation but is not so bad. I am pleased with this drug. By the way I eat nothing in the bread family.",5,5,5
this drug has really brought my A1c down from 9.2 to 6.2. only problem I see is the COST. I too have had some bladder infections. But I only get one every 6 months. I am having a problem with hair loss not sure what is causing it.,5,5,5
"My blood sugars are now in control, plus I have lost weight! I take Azo yeast pills and Azo cranberry pills to ward off any side effects, no issues! Also  stay well hydrated.",3,5,5
"I was taking Glipizide and Metformin. I was getting regular morning blood sugar spikes over 200. My Dr. substituted Invokana and Januvia. Within a day my blood sugar readings stabilized to 70 - 100 (max). Over 3 months my A1C went from 8.1 to 5.9 (it's now at 5.5 one year later). I'm down 65 pounds over that time frame (with a lot of hard work and counting carbs, fat, and calories. The only side affect is dry mouth at night and have lost a bit a pressure when urinating. No pain.",5,4,5
"I began taking 300mgs in Sept. 2014.My a1c was 15.After 3 mos.,it came down to 5.6.I had a yeast infection in the beginning and a uti,resulting from my high bs.One yeast infection since.OTC products didn't work.After a culture,I used boric acid suppositories,prescribed by my doctor.They worked,and I now eat yogurt and take probiotics.So far,so good.",5,5,5
Didn't take long enough to assess effectiveness. Immediately gave me a severe yeast infection. had a bladder infection 1 week later that may also have been due to the drug.,5,1,1
"The drug works great to lower my blood sugar, but it causes migraines for me. Severe migraines. I had the same experience with Farxiga. ",5,1,4
I have been taking this medication for one month I have notice I have dry mouth and vaginal itching. ,4,2,3
I was put on Invokana because of issues with Metformin. Since I started I've lost 12 lbs and my A1C dropped from 8.4 to 6.7.,5,5,5
"Started on 300mg June 8th, 2014.  Went from 278 pounds to 237 pounds in 6 months.  My A1C went from 8.4 to 7.2.  Dr took me off Metformin in October due to kidney function test results (I had the same issue 3 years ago).  Other than peeing all friggin day, I feel great.  I now know what ""urgency"" means when it comes to urination.  Expensive meds, however.  I am not sure I can afford much more of this.",5,5,5
"Started with 100mg. two weeks, then started 300mg. My blood sugar numbers good,but having major yeast infections. Dr. said treat over counter 7 days, hasn't work. Ready to call Dr. & ask if this medicine going to cause these infections all time then I want to stop. Already had to stop Metformin because of side effects. Not pleased.",4,3,4
I have lost enough water in my legs to need new pants. My blood sugar has been stable. I do need to drink a little more water but I needed to do that any way. I am now only getting twice a night.,4,5,5
"I started taking invokana in May of 2014, I started out with 100 mg then after a month went up to 300, all was well until December of 2014 when I started having itching and burning in privates and I am taking my self off until I talk with my doctor about it... It was great my sugar level has been the best ever since being diagnosed in 2009 but I do not like that I got a UTI and I am sure I do not want to have to deal with the pain of having UTI or yeast infection...   ",4,3,4
I began taking Invokana 300 mg one month ago and my H A1C has gone from 8.6 to 7.6. It has never been this low and I have been on insulin for 24 years. Also it has reduced my appetite and any desire for sweets or over-eating and I have lost 8 lbs. My insulin is reduced by half already and I think this is a miracle drug. I will stay on this as long as my Dr tells me to. :),5,5,5
"Invokana 100 mg for 1 month, 200 mg for 2 months. A1C used to range from 7.4 to 8.4...after 3 months A1c was 9.0! Lost 7 pounds (1 gallon of water is approx. 7 lbs) had 1 yeast infection...been on 300 mg for 3 months and am crossing my fingers for my blood test next month.",4,2,2
"I have tried everything to help my Diabetes of 24 years. Only this one, accompanied by Metformin, has worked! 30 days on 100 mg and now 30 days into my 300 mg. I feel reborn! I LOVE this medication! I have lost weight, my A1C has dropped a lot and I only have a minor yeast infection which hardly bothers me at all. I am not urinating any more than I was before but I am feeling constipated.  My lantis insulin at bedtime has decreased to 30 from 42 units. And my humalog insulin throughout the day only totals to 12, compared to 30. I am a very satisfied patient and hope to continue on this forever!  :)",5,5,5
"A1C went down 1.1 points after 6 months on 100, so, we upped it to 300 and I'll see next checkup if it makes results in a similar positive difference.  Been having troubles with bowels, but keep it mostly regular with oatmeal..  I drink a gallon a day and make trips to the sandbox at least every hour..  This med works for me, minimal side effects.",5,4,4
A miracle for me. I have been taking 100 mg for 3 months and my A1C went from 7.6 to 7.0 and have lost 8 pounds. You must drink plenty of water and more trips to the restroon but that is a small price to pay. ,5,5,5
"Quit injecting insulin four times a day, getting much better fasting blood sugar numbers. Have gone from a 36 inch waists to a 33 inch waist in 6 months...",5,5,5
"this drug caused extreme constipation, I experienced weight loss and loss of appetite, after about one year on this drug, I found myself getting low blood sugar problems. my last blood test showed my A1C to be boarder line diabetic and I am no longer on any meds for diabetes. I am not sure how long this will last as I am putting the weight back on quickly now that I am off the meds.  ",5,5,5
I'm gals to see others have posted that they have had constipation issues. I have only been on this medicine 8 days and I love it bc my readings are more normal but I'm constipated and have developed a yeast infection. No dry mouth. I do drink enough so that can't be a factor to constipation. I go back in 3 weeks for a follow up,5,4,5
 I find because of the increase in urination I am getting very constipated.,5,5,4
"It kept my sugar readings low but my A1C went up when I used it. It helped my improve my sex drive and did not cause me to feel bad. The worst part was the yeast infections that would not clear up, so the doctor stopped the medication.",4,3,3
"Frequent Urination uncontrolled day and night,dry mouth, and Oxybutynin not working.   ",5,1,2
still have not seen any difference since i've started using this med.,5,3,3
I am completing week 4 of the drug. I became highly allergic to metformin (side effects got bad) so we are trying this.  Dehydration is there but lessens over time. I keep a bottle of water close at hand however. I have a slight odor to the urine but no infections. I am not Type 2 yet but pre-diabetic so my AC 1 is hovering around 6ish sometimes 5 something- some times 6 to a 6.2 depending on what I eat. I have PCOS and am a prime candidate for that to change so we are being proactive rather than reactive. Slight decrease in wanting foods..small meals more so than anything. Bathroom use up a lot I have to say- so far so good I guess. ,5,4,3
"Was on Metformin 1000mg, amaryl 4 mg, placed on Invokana due to increase of AIC from 6.8-7.4.(Kept on metformin and amaryl) Did fine for 3 months, lost approx 10 pounds,AIC dropped to 6.4, then the burning, itching, chafing, and yeast began. I Have been using Monistat suppositories and cream, and A&D ointment, however I'm debating whether I want to deal with this everyday? Also eat yogurt every day. Am going to try a probiotic, and see what happens. If nothing changes I will have to go off this medication. I also have to pay a premium for this drug in accordance with my Medicare D plan. Interesting to read others similar occurances. I'm struggling, but I will go another month before giving it up.",4,2,4
"I took 100mg dose for approx. 3 months.  Toward the end of that time, I had to have a Urine Culture done(I have major lower back problems and a lot of pain, so that is why I take the test) and it came back that I had alcohol in my urine!!!!  I do not drink any alcohol.  But, I did have yeast infections.  With the kidneys shooting out more sugar and the infections, I think Invokana was the cause of my test result!!! At this time, my dr. has increased my dosage to 300.  To be honest, I do not know what I will do.    ",4,1,1
"Started with 100, upped to 300 after 8 months. No other medication.  Did drop some weight.  I do drink lots of water, but get terribly constipated, with hard and painful stools.  I also have a UTI that comes and goes.  And a skin rash from the sugar in the urine.  Similar to a fungus.  Not really sure I want to continue this medicine.",3,2,3
I started out taking 100mg and never increased it. I took it for 2 months with no side effects. After that I started having terrible yeast infections and UTI. Yes it works and I lost a few pounds. I had to stop taking it all together. My blood sugar has been pretty good every since because I drink mostly water throughout the day. Although they are not as bad as when I was on the medication I am still getting the yeast infections. It was nothing but a problem for me.,5,1,4
"Been on Invokana for 2 months, started with 100mg for 10 days and 200mg thereafter. Before I was taking 2000mg of Metformin 120mg Diamicron 75 units of Lantus in the morning and 1 unit of Novorapid per 2 grams of carbs at meals. After one week on the 100 mg of Invokana I stopped both insulins. I continued taking the same doses of Metformin and Diamicron. The results have been miraculous, my average A1C went fro 9 percent down to 7.2 percent and I have lost 27 lbs.When I was on insulin I was always hungry, once I came off the hunger went away, energy levels are up as I no longer have massive glucose swings. My Dr. just put me on 300mg of Invokana a day and I'm feeling great. I believe that this medication is a game changer for type 2 diabetes.I must admit that I haven't exactly been very strict with my diet so I probably would have lost more than 27 lbs.",5,5,5
I haven't been taking this long but I've seen my sugar levels drop. I haven't had any of the side effects listed and I was very nervous about it. I get yeast infections and UTIs easily....thought this was a recipe for me to get more. So far so good!! ,5,5,5
It should be called REVOKEana  Not INVOKana. total disaster--i work in a call center--i cannot get up to pee every few minutes--just about cost me my job --yeast infections from hell.  Minor drop in AIC  15.3 to 14.9 - not covered by insurance--close to 300/mo minor weight loss under 10 lbs.  going back to simply injecting more insulin--i really don;lt care about weight loss.,4,1,1
I started this medication (Invokanamet Invokana w/ Metformin 50/500 bid) around two weeks ago. I believe that my body is getting use to the new medication. I am a little dehydrated and I do urinate alot more but I have faith in this drug. I will update after 6 weeks which is when I am getting a new blood test. So far so good.,5,4,4
Best thing ever. I'm on an insulin pump because of high insulin resistance. I use 300 plus units a day. I have tried all the pills and shots and nothing has ever worked. Invokana has lowered my A1c from 8 to 6.5 and i have lost 17lbs so far. I have also lowered my insulin intake by 40% so far. I have to admit the frequent urination is tiresome but worth it considering the down side. It is nice to have a diabetic medication that actually helps you lose wait instead of gaining it.   ,5,5,5
Works for me but after turning 65 and on Medicare D I will have to stop using it.  Ins will not pay.  Only side affect I have noticed is dehydration and my LDL has increased.  Drug company gave it to be free but after starting Medicare they stopped.  Doesn't make sense since I can't afford it now that I'm on Social Security,5,5,5
I have not had any unusual symptoms with this medication. It does make you urinate often and you should prepare a plan for hydrating yourself for the fist two or three weeks. It normalizes after a while. I haven't had my A1C taken yet (next month) so I can't say that I have lowered my blood sugars. I have lost weight though and didn't really try that hard. Several days upon rising my blood sugar was below 60 so I have to be careful not to take too much insulin before bed time. I recommend this medication if you are on insulin along with metformin and glimiperide medications. Your doctor will tell you if you need less medication . . don't make that decision on your own.,5,5,5
I have lost 21 lbs. but my A1C has raised considerably in teh last few months.  My doctor just now told me I should be taking Metformin with it!  I had two bladder infections in teh beginning.  Now I still have burning and itching.  I felt it was worth it due to weight loss.  Now I'm afraid to stop taking this and going to the traditional diabetic meds because I don't want to gain the weight back!!,4,4,3
"I have been taking the 100mg once a day along with Glucophage 1000mg 2x daily, Actos 45mg once daily, and Glimeperide 4mg 2x daily.  I had excessive urination the first 2 weeks but that has slowed down a bit.  No urinary tract or yeast infections.  Drinking plenty of fluids helps. A1C went from 8.1 to 6.6 and within the first 30 days my glimepiride was cut to 2mg.  This is working great for me.",5,5,5
While my A1C did go down and I did lose weight I ended up with acute renal failure. My kidney funtions were normal before taking the med. I started the med end of march and was in the hospital 4th of july. the Dr. told me I almost died.,2,1,2
Drug works great but dr had to keep me on an antibiotic to keep from getting yeast infection ,5,5,5
"Yeast infection for 3 months!  Not worth the misery.  Worst infection I've ever had.  Monistat and Diflucan tablets the entire time.  My Dr. says it's doing its job by releasing sugar through my urine, just can't stand the discomfort any longer.",5,1,2
Had serious doubts because its so new but I have not had anything adverse to speak of...In the beginning I felt slightly lightheaded but remembered that Invoksna can cause dehydration and dehydration can cause light hesdedness...so I drank more water and the dizziness stopped!...I'm fine with it.,5,5,4
I have been on it for about 4 weeks and it has been amazing.  My last A1C was over 10 and I was trying everything to get it down.  This one little 100mg pill in the morning changed all that.  Over the last 3 1/2 weeks i have not had a glucose reading over 130!!,5,5,5
"Developed sever nausea and vomiting after 3 days after taking 100 mg. daily. Extremely lightheaded, and slightly unstable on my feet.  ALWAYS in the bathroom urinating, that was crazy. I was using samples and I am glad I did because my insurance would not cover the this medication.  I stopped the medication!  ",4,1,3
"I have been on Invokana for over a year. With great numbers,A1C dropped from 13 to 6 within a few months. Also dropped 20lbs. No side affects. My advice for the yeast infections is to cut out everything else that has yeast in it. Such as bread, rolls, beer, anything with yeast. It's worked for me. Also zero calorie Powerade or Gatorade helps if you get dehydrated. Cut out the yeast, drink lots of fluids and feel great. ",5,5,5
Worst yeast infection I have ever had afer 2 weeks on this medication. 3 diflucan tablets and vaginal cream and I'm still in misery. ,5,3,2
Been on it 3 days.  Side effects have been terrible.  Going to stop taking it and talk to my doctor about another option.,1,1,1
"I do not recommend. I took invokana because I am insulin intolerant. Taking only 1 tablet 1Xday the PA wanted to increase to 3 times a day, sugars still high. I said no because It seemed to be causing some kidney problems. The end of January 2014 I had a pancreas attack. Being is great pain I was admitted to hospital and found out my pancreas was inflamed.  I have had 2 children, kidney stones and hysterectomy.  All those were a piece of cake  compared to an inflamed pancreas.  Going NPO for 3 days was no picnic.  Learning to eat again is still a problem.  My pancreas is still inflamed and constantly watched.  I have had 4 CT scans with dye since then.  I would not give or take Invokana ever again, the chance of getting pancreatitis is too great.",3,1,3
"I am Type 1 (or 1 1/2) diabetic and have had H1ac range from 9-13 for years.  After 2 months on 100mg of Invokana I lost 1o lbs,  reduced insulin by 1/3 amount,  lowered H1ac to 7.4!!! And I feel GREAT!!!!!! Less hungry, fewer lows, less highs.",5,5,5
"BS values went way down after just the first few days on it.  Weight loss also came after some time on it.  Frequent urination at first, not as much in month 3",5,4,5
"Fasting BS have been around 200.  Tried just about everything and nothing worked.  After second dose of Invokana, my fasting BS was 97.  Really no side effects for me.",5,5,5
"I was currently taking Amaryl 4mg twice daily and Janumet 50/1000 twice daily. The doctor took me off Amaryl and started me on Invokana 100mg once in the morning. After a month, I went up to 300mg once in the morning. The doctor warned me about yeast infections so I started taking Oil of Oregano. I took two, but once I started Invokana 300 mg, I noticed I was beginning to get a yeast infection, so I quickly bumped it up to 3 Oil of Oregano pills daily, praying it would work. I also started eating yogurt. I have been eating the Poplait light but the sugar content is high so I'm going to look for a carb friendly yogurt or the Total Fage Greek Yogurt. The yogurt and the 3 Oil of Oregano pills work for me I just had to be patient and give it time. Here's something crazy. I walk on the weekends and try to watch what I eat, BUT that doesn't explain the crazy weight loss I have been experiencing. I weighed in at 261 when I went to the doctor July 25. Today (Aug 27), I am 241. That is NUTS! I hope this medication doesn't have any serious drawbacks cause I am in love. I was almost going to add the probiotics but I don't think I'll need it. Nonetheless, I will be taking this medicine until I can manage without it. ",5,5,5
So far no side effects ,5,5,5
"I had terrible leg cramps more often than usual. I lost 5 pounds in 2 days. Excessive urination caused dehydration. I already had problems with dehydration, so I stopped taking the med. Very disapponited that I had to stop",5,1,1
I've been taking Invokana for three months now. I'm was on Lantus 40 unit daily before starting this medication. Since taking it i am down to 20 units Lantus daily. i also take Janumet xr 100-1000. I'm hoping to get off my Lantus in a few months,5,5,5
Just started today on 100mg. The dr gave me a card that makes if free for the first 4 months and 5 bucks after that.  I'm on Janumet and Novolog.  I'm hoping to get completely off the Novolog.  My sugars avg around 200 right now.  Fingers crossed. :),5,5,5
"It did help my Blood Sugars to come down.  But, had to get off of it because of the yeast infections.",5,1,5
My numbers came down the same day I used this medication! From the 200 and 300 to 167's. I am still seeing a decline and I am Thrilled. It's only been a month and I see numbers that I haven't seen in years. 18 years type II and this is THE drug that finally did the trick for me. No side effects at all. I take the 100 dose. I am very very happy.,5,5,5
I have been on this medication for 2 mos. now with no notice of a consistant drop in my blood sugar.It is wonderful as far as no side effects but cannot KEEP a decent range on my sugar. Granted I have only been diagnosed since May.,5,2,3
I AM A TYPE I  DIABETIC I HAVE HAD THIS FOR OVER 40 YEARS...THIS is THE  VERY  FIRST  TIME  I have had my blood sugars under control in yrs one in  am before  meals  and since I spike  around  midnight extremely high I take 1/2 before bed  it  work!!!,5,5,5
"Love the fact that with my other diabetes meds  my readings have been below 140 and had some below 100. Have not lost any weight but I can eat what I want within reason and not gain. But, the big problem is not the bath room visits,it is the YEAST INFECTIONS. They started about 3 months in and just won't totally go away, it flares up @ every 2 weeks. I've tried just about every thing, may have to give up the drug.  ",5,3,4
Have been on Invokana 300mg onace a day for 6 months. Last A1c is 6.9. It works. Like the ease of usage. Have had diabetes for 23 years. Definitely a keeper with no side effects. Of course the savings card helped me. Without that would be expensive.,5,5,5
Reduced blood sugar by over 100 points ,5,5,5
blood sugar level keeps droping to60 or below.,4,2,3
Very expensive! Dr. filled out paperwork to make the cost within reason but drug stores won't accept this as we have Medicare D.,5,5,5
"After one month, HbA1C is down 1.6. Only side effects are slightly increased thirst and a couple more trips to the restroom.",5,5,5
"I have been taking Invokana for a month now.  The dr. prescribed 100mg but recently boost to 300mg, for type 2 diabetes.  The only side effect I am experiencing is dry mouth.  I take one pill a day.  I did notice a difference when I ran after she increased the dosage.",5,5,5
I have been on the maximum dosage for about a year. I was a bit depressed because I was laid of from my job of 18 years and have not been taking care of myself and eating everything in sight. Even though I have been eating horrible my Diabetes is down to normal with this drug with absolutely no side effects. I am amazed. ,5,5,5
"I've been on 100mg (plus metformin) for about two weeks and so far my BG has dropped by 30mg/ml and my weight has decreased by 8 pounds (probably water loss). I have been deliberately drinking more water to ward off dehydration, but also notice increased urination. So far I am very happy with this drug and will continue it for 90 days then evaluate with my doctor whether to continue or go back to metformin/Lantus",5,5,5
I have been on the 100mg about a month and my blood sugar is in normal ranges. It was running 250 to 300 even on insulin. I have cut my insulin back 50% and so far no side effects. Wonder drug so far.,5,5,5
I have taken this medicine for over 5 months. I have lost 35 lbs. and can not believe how easy it has been. Sure I have to urinate at least every 5 hours. But that is a small price to pay for the results!,5,5,5
"For the past few weeks of being on this new drug to control my Type II Diabetes, I find myself incredibly thristy, haveing to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. This is causing me to have insomnia. I am also having trouble concentrating at times and am dizzy and feel like I may blackout at times.  I have lost weight.  I am awaiting my next dr visit to see if my blood sugars have gotten better, but will discuss the side effects as well to see if they will subside as time goes on.  ",5,3,4
"I've been on these meds for 8 month. Dr. Insisted I continue since we had tried so many different meds to lower my blood sugar. Yeast infections were not a problem the first couple of months, but they started coming!!!!! I have taken myself off this horrible drug! I now have a yeast infection every 2 weeks that last for 2 weeks. I am miserable. Never did lower my levels , increased in fact. I am dehydrated & feel bad most of the time. Do Not Take!!!!!",5,1,1
"Prior to taking this drug; I was retaining a lot of urine.  Had was stretched and emptied quite of bit of urine.  Been on this pill for 5-6 days and the urine started changing colors.  Beginning pink/red; I stopped the pill to see what happens and after 6 days it cleared up.  I started up on them again this morning.  I did lose in the first 5 days, 6 lbs.   Also, my urine turned dark brown toward the last two days.  ",5,5,5
I've been on Invokana 300 mg for 1 month and a half. I have not experienced any side affects as of yet. I've had diabetes for 37 years and so far Invokana has helped me lower my glucose levels very well. After reading other reviews I'm alarmed how this drug performs so differently with different people. Some people are near death and others not. I wonder if anyone has an answer to this controversy?,5,5,5
After 3 months came down with pancreatitis and almost died. Enter hospital on 2/24/2014 and is still in the hospital. I had 16 surgeries and may need more. I lost my colon and part of my pancreatus due to the infection from this pill. I am still not out of the woods. Do not take this pill.,5,1,1
"I took this drug for 3 days.  After blacking out and severe dizziness, rash and urination have stopped.  Now 3 days later I am still with the rash and getting over dehydration.  I did lose 10lbs in 3 days.  ",5,1,3
"I have been on Invokana (100mg) and 1000 mg Metformin once a day since March 31, 2014.  I have been drinking fluids and urinating constantly.  I can't pass a bathroom! At first I had no problem with Yeast infections.  Then suddenly, it feels as though someone has taken a blowtorch to my nether regions.  I have tried probiotics, cranberry supplements, over the counter yeast treatments, diaper creams,etc. nothing seems to have a lasting effect.  The Invokana has had a good effect on my A1c, my weight is down and my cravings for sweets and carbs seem to have diminished, but the yeast side effect has almost brought me to my knees.   The yeast infections seem to be the worst of it, other than that, I can handle the frequent urination and dry mouth.  I plan to try to stick with the meds a little longer to see if the side effects will diminish .",5,3,4
I did not notice drastic lower readings. but after taking this medicine and using the restroom a million times a day I have decided it is not for me. I am still battling yeast infection. I also experienced pressure I guess from bladder. After reading side effects I am sure this is not for me!,4,1,2
"I was thrilled with the results of Invokana on my glucose numbers.  I have basically been following a vegan diet for years but still had high blood glucose levels.  I had tried many drugs to reduce my numbers from pills to injectables, but had terrible side effects or no drop in glucose numbers.  Invokana seemed wonderful.  Unfortunately, candida started to overtake everything after several months.  I had always taken a probiotic daily but it wasn't enough.  Suffering now from oral candida, (tongue is a mess) trouble with ears and eyes,( eye pressure dropped to normal upon cessation of Invokana) stomach, vagina, anus, rosacea!  I tried so hard to stay on the drug but this condition is just too uncomfortable.  ",5,1,5
"I have reviewed this drug twice, both rave reviews. I couldn't help but notice that some users have complained about severe yeast infections. I would like to offer some advice that may be helpful. Along with my invokana (300 mg.) and metformin (1000 mg. twice a day) I also take a probiotic female supplement called ""RepHresh Pro-B"" . It's a little pricey, ($29.99) at Walmart, for a 30 day supply but it well worth it in my opinion! I've been on invokana for over 30 days and have taken this supplement from day 1 along with it because I saw reviews about getting yeast infections. I haven't had this problem yet and hope it stays that way! I also eat yogurt twice a day. Hope this helps! ",5,5,5
"Have been taken this medication for only 2 days and already have seen a drop in my number. Sure, I have to drink more than what I usually drink and go to the bathroom more but, if it helps me in the long run, I don't mind. For the people who say that it costs more than your other meds, if you have insurance, there is a copay card, your doctor can give it to you or you can call Invokana directly, as long as you have a prescription, where it will cost you only $5 per month, the first 4 month are free and for the next 8 month it is 5 dollars. I hope that this will help some of you.",5,5,5
The most telling side effect is the  strong & sudden urge to urinate.,5,5,4
took for 3 months got very bad side affect jaundice bilirbin of 38.9 hospitalized 9 days feet itchy hands had the bilirbin burned holes in my skin constant bood test liver damage invokana helped till this happened couldn t sleep at night constant peeing got infection in my for skin lost 95 pounds was close to death was off work for 7 months only took invokana for 3 months went from 292 pds to 197 ,1,1,1
"This is an update from my last review. Was on invokana 100 mg. for 10 days, it was working so well that my dr. Placed me on 300 mg. in hopes that I could stop taking levemir altogether. It worked! I feel great! My blood sugar is better than ever, I have been on 300 mg. for 10 days now. When I wake in the mornings my BS is anywhere from 93-110 and pretty much stays steady for most of the day. I also take metformin 1000 mg. twice a day, along with a probiotic to prevent yeast infections (because invokana is known for creating that problem) no yeast infections! Thank goodness!  This medicine has been so beneficial to me. I no longer take levemir at all. My energy is up, I no longer feel tired and sluggish through the day, I have lost a total of 9 lbs. since first taking invokana (20 days ago) so far I have nothing bad to say about this drug. It does cause dry mouth and frequent urination, you MUST stay hydrated while using this medicine... So of coarse you WILL urinate more often, but it's worth it for the results I am seeing! ",5,5,5
"I was taking a cocktail of pills (12 a day, 6 meds)to control my diabetes. I'm down to 3 meds.& my A1C is down,7 from 9 a year ago. I have lost weight and my eating habits have changed for the better. At the beginning, I was thirsty and had dry mouth. Also I had to use the bathroom more than usual. Now that my numbers are better, I feel better.",5,5,4
"Male 55 years of age; took 100 mg once daily for six months; lost 7 lbs, hardly ever have to inject Humalog; decreased Amaryl from 4 mg daily to 2 mg daily and discontinued last week per endocrinologist at my 6 month appointment. Increased Invokana to 300 mg and continue Bydureon weekly and metformin 1000 mg twice daily. ",5,5,5
"Been on 100 mg. treatment for 10 days now, I also continue to take metformin 1000mg 2 x a day. Levemir 30 units a day .... Now I'm down to 10 units a day. The invokana is helping so much that I am taking less levemir. Dr. Just upped my dose today to 300 mg. invokana in hopes that I can discontinue levemir all together. BS is doing much better, fasting BS was in the 200-300 range, now it's in the 100-140 range. In the 10 days that I have been on invokana 100 mg. I have lost 6 pounds. I take a once a day probiotic to prevent yeast infections, so far no problem with that. My energy is up and I'm feeling great. So far nothing but positive results. Will post again after I've taken the 300 mg. for awhile.",5,5,4
"After three months, my husband developed acute pancreatitis. In hospital for over 5 weeks, 10 surgeries, and near death. Do not take this medicine. ",4,1,1
"I started experiencing leg and foot cramps right after starting at 100mg dose.  A doctor suggested drinking a glass of Tonic Water (I drink the diet) every day.  This greatly decreased the cramps, then stopped them after a few months. It took about 6 months for the Invokana to kick in, then I suddenly began experiencing very low blood sugars. My doctor stopped my Levemir, Symlin and Glipizide, and told me to take a low dose of the Humulin 70/30 only when my pre-meal blood sugar is over 140, which is not frequent.  He said he ""might have to take me completely off insulin!"", words I never expected to hear.  I still take Metformin 1000 X 2 daily. My new drug plan is balking at approving the Invokana, and wants me to try another drug, but I am appealing.  This drug has been miraculous!",5,5,5
"After several years of trying to get BS Spikes under control, my Dr recently prescribed Invokana and after only 4 days,the spikes are gone.",5,5,5
"In Nov2013 my A1C was 9.4. My doctor put me on the following cocktail of med: Invokana 100mg first thing in the morning.  Then Jentadueto 2.5/100 mg with 4mg of prandin with first meal of day and dinner.  My A1C went down to 7.1.  I no longer have 300 or 200 range blood sugar checks.  I never used to get yeast infections and now i do and they are bad. In addition I have had some small bladder leakages, urine emergencies, dry mouth and small weight loss.  I am not the biggest fan of Invokana but I can attest that it works.",5,4,4
Just thrilled how Invokana is helping with my elevated blood sugar. Having tried most everything else this is a God sent.                                             ,5,5,5
"Removed from Duetact, on for 2 months now, weight down 10 # . Blood sugar up about 20 points. watching this. Feel good. If only the BS would come down I would be very happy.",5,4,3
On my 3rd day of taking it. Noticed some swelling in my feet area. Numbers have been coming down. Taking once a day 100mg,4,3,3
"Weakness, vulva infection, stomach pain, frequency of nocturnal urination, tired, dizziness, difficulty swallowing.",4,2,2
"Is anyone experiencing indigestion taking invokana?  My doctor recently changed my meds from byduron to invokana because the byduron caused excessive acid in my stomach.  I started out at 100mg and was tolerating it and not having the indigestion.  Now that the dose has been increased to 30mg, the indigestion is back.  ",2,2,2
my blood sugar went up in the 400's ended up in the ER weak kidneys hurting dehydrated only took this for 3 days,5,1,1
"THIS IS MY FOURTH DAY OF TAKING 300MG IN THE MORNING. NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO MY BS WHICH ON OCASSIONS WERE AT THE 250'S AND TAKING BYDUREON AND 1,000 METFORMIN.  I STOPPED ALL BAD CARBS SINCE I STARTED ON THE MED AND I HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC DROP WITH MY BS TO 120'S AFTER A MEAL.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS FEELING TIRED AT TIMES AND FEEL LIKE MY LEG GIVE OUT AT TIMES. I WILL CONTINUE BOTH WITH A GOOD DIET AND MEDICATION.   ",5,5,5
On 300 mg tab once a day. This med has been great! With insulin has dropped my sugar numbers from 300-400 a day to the 100s. The bonus has been a loss of weight. 45 pounds so far. I am thrilled! ,5,5,5
Terrible dry mouth,3,1,3
"Type 2 Diabetic, I just started this drug yesterday 300mg also with 1,000mg Metformin x2 a day and also Onglyza and have been so nauseated that I feel like if I eat it will help so I do and it is ok for short time. Woke up at 1:30 got sick. Having the blurred vision, thirst and a lot more urination as expected. My sugar dropped from 457 to 137 this morning in a day so may not be taking the other 2 diabetic meds prescribed. Also lost 3 lbs first day, a plus to it but not good if I have to feel like this. Leg and foot cramps also through the night. Will give it chance but if side effects dont calm down I can not do this every day.",5,2,5
This medication has caused severe stomach cramps and uncontrollable belching. I have had to stop once and then start back with every other day which I could tolerate and now back at daily and the side effects are starting again. ,3,2,3
"I have type 2 diabetes and my sugars were still to high with just Metformin. My doc started me out on 100mg did good. upped to 300mg, not so good. really fatigued, stomach felt nauseated and my heart was beating fast but not very hard. I had one episode where everything looked like it was moving. Stopped taking it. Doctor wants me to go back to the 100mg Not sure yet if I will or not. Did loose  weight good while taking.  ",5,3,3
"I started off taking 300 mg but switched to 100 mg due to the side effects.  Currently I have been taking med for 4 weeks. I noticed decrease in BS at various times throughout the day.  Side effects are unbelievable increased in urination (about every 45 minutes all day long) and very thirsty.   I became dehydrated the 2nd day after my gym workout which caused me to drink more water or a 0 sugar sports drink for the electrolytes which is good anyway. I Lost about 12 pounds during the first 2 weeks and still losing abou 2 to 3 pounds per week.  I sometimes have leg & foot cramps at nite which keeps me up with the frequent urination.  Overall, the results that I am achieving so far exceeds the side effects which I hope will go away soon. ",4,4,4
I started taking Ivokana a little over a month ago and right away I noticed my blood sugar reading drop. I have little to no side effects a bit of light headedness and thist increase which is good cause it causes me to drink more water. also i have lost close to 30lbs. LOVE THIS INVOKANA!!!!,5,5,5
"Diaper rash like you cannot believe.  I have stopped taking it for 2 weeks, but am still scratching, so very unattractive on a woman. Expensive, too.  I am going to stop altogether.",1,1,3
"I take 100 mg daily. Side effects right away were loud ringing in ears and pulse pounding. Pulse has leveled off but ringing is constant. B/S readings began dropping immediately as urine increased and yeast infection flared. Yeast infection comes and goes. After one week I had severe leg cramps at night that lasted for hours, so I drank much more water during the day.  That helped but not completely. Legs, ankles are swollen and tingling, thumbs numb/tingling. Have lost appetite mostly due to mild nausea. I feel like my body has lost its strength, especially my legs, which freaks me out. I'm not sure I'm willing to endure these side effects, but will give it until this Rx runs out to see if they go away.",5,3,3
"I've been taking this medication for three weeks, started on 100 mg per day for two weeks and now am on 300 mg per day for maintenance dose.  No untoward side effects except light-headedness which I resolve by sitting and increasing my hydration.  I've lost 7 pounds so far, have discontinued my diuretic (with MD knowledge), have decreased Humulog 75/25 by 25% and am getting the best blood sugars of the year despite it being holidays.  I can't wait to decrease the Humalog some more at my January appointment!",5,5,5
"I've been on this drug for 3-4 months now. Love it. My BS numbers dropped which in turn caused me to be able to drop my lantus by 10 units. I've lost about 10 lbs so far and have noticed a strong decrease in my appetite. I recommend trying this drug for sure. Get the Invokana card which allows you to get it for $5, it's on the Invokana website. ",4,4,4
Has helped lower my A1C.,5,5,4
"only going on my 3rd week ,worst side effect -very dehydrated- but I am also on other medication with same side effect - just drinking a lot of water now , urinating more frequently as expected - my blood sugar numbers are really good and in range - had my first reading under 100 in a year -- oh the best side effect is I already lost 10 lb - and have not changed anything but adding this medication --can not wait to see if this continues - that would be great I haven't lost any weight in 2 years of mildly trying ",5,5,5
A1c marginally improved. No weight loss. Diet stable. Developed external yeast infection 6 months ago. No better. Not sure how much longer I can endure it. ,5,3,4
"Been on for 1.5 months. Blood sugar stabilizing, bad yeast infection from it, so now am taking double the probiotics to help keep that at bay. Have lost 12 lbs since taking, am more thirsty on it as well.",5,4,5
"pretty good so far, on it for about 3 weeks now.  have noticed severe gas with this med tho, I can easily clear out a large room -oh well.  other then that I will have to see what my insurance will cover after my year of 5$ co-pay is up.  if it is too much I will just go back to victoza which was working well also.",5,4,4
"I take Invokana in the morning, Medformin at dinner and Lantus at bedtime.  BS levels are more stable now and do see increased urination and GI symptoms.  Haven't had any weight loss yet which I thought was going to happen-not happy about that. It's only been a week since medication added.",4,3,4
I really like how the Invokana has helped with my BS  but I've noticed that I can eat all the time even though it was to help you lose weight!  Anyone else have this problem?,4,4,4
"Since starting Invokana, my blood sugar readings are steadier and I do not have the big swings high or low. I feel better but do have to urinate more.",5,4,4
"I take one 100 mg tablet first thing in the morning. Blood sugar readings before meals are good. Morning fasting blood sugar readings are better than they have ever been since I was diagnosed 14+ years ago. I also take metformin, glimeperide, Lantus, and Bydureon. Invokana manufacturer provided a card which makes my co-payment $5 until March 2014.",5,5,5
"After the second day, I broke out in a reaction.  I had hives from head to toe.  Until now, I have not been allergic to anything.  The doctor had to prescribe a steroid to offset the effects.",1,1,1
"Middle aged male with Type2 here.  Overall my BS numbers were OK but could be better (that's mainly on me due to my diet could be better).  Invokana caused my BS to plummet to normal ranges (and was a cause for my first sub 100 since I was diagnosed).  Definitely see increased urination, but not uncontrollable.  Doctor warned me about possible urinary tract yeast infections but haven't seen that.  Main drawback is my insurance copay on this drug is much higher than my other meds.",4,4,5
"Prior A1c ~ 6.3. Current unknown.  This newly available medicine induces a form of sugar elimination with which A) I have dealt throughout life(congenital renal glycosuria - identified around age 4),and B)I consistently evidenced until around age 70. *High sugar in urine, low in blood, excess Na and glucose elimination, too low BP at times.  At this time Invokana, 100 mg, steady state, seems to lower all blood glucose readings to approx. normal (<150 - 90>). (Low carb diet) Sugar spill into urine stops at approx. 100 not 140.                Metformin, Januvia did not predictably control (ranges from <100 to >250), even when drug kinetics were carefully taken into consideration. ",5,5,5
it lowered my fasting bg from 200 to in the 130's nice deal. yes makes you have a dry mouth more so. makes you pee a little more. I do take a probiotic to keep the yeast down being diabectic makes you pron to it anyways.,5,4,4
"I have been using Invokana for about a month now and I feel better. I have dropped 17lbs (Yes, I know) I could not believe how much weight I dropped in just one month. I will say that out of no where I experienced a bad yeast infection and I don't know if this medicine is the cause of it. I'm curious to see what my numbers will look like next time I go in to visit my doctor.  I also want to add that I went to the website and I'm only paying $5.00 for my medication using Invokana Carepath. ",5,5,5
"I just started this drug today but I am mostly writing to tell everyone I got a discount card from my doctor and only will pay 5 dollars a month for a year.  Then hopefully my insurance will pay more than my co pay of 35 dollars.  But 5 dollars is great,  Will definitely be getting some yogurt to combat the yeast infections.",3,3,3
"Been on this for a little over 2 weeks now,and love it. My glucose dropped from 270's to 130's in this short amount of time. If you keep hydrated,you will feel great. As an MLT,I see the results daily of un-controled glucose. The minor side effects are well worth this. Metformin did nothing but make me sick all the time. ",4,4,5
"Easy to use, however, weak, lightheaded, loss of appetite.  Numbers a little better after taking.",3,1,3
"I have never had such a terrible yeast infection in my life, since I was on invokana.",4,1,3
"I have been taking for almost a month, I am not very satisfied with the effects. My numbers have not gone down to where I want them still in the 200's from 300-400 before taking the drug.  Will not continue only using because was given a free 30 day sample.  Can not afford the drug at $300 per month.",5,1,1
sleeplessness,3,3,3
"My HMO refused to fill my Dr's script for this med, and in true HMO fashion, neglected to get in touch with me an let me know why. After I called them, they told me-cost of a 90-day script? Eight Hundred and Forty-Nine Smackers! Told them forget it, I would just put that toward the cost of a casket!",3,1,2
I am taking it for weight loss in addition to diabetes.  The weight loss seems to be accomplished by a low grade nasuau or uncomfortable feeling in the stomach.  Does not occur all of the time but some of the time both before and after eating.  Removes a lot of the pleasure of eating by making me feel crappy.  Also much more lightheadedness and things along those lines.  Probably going to stop taking it.  I will take insulin by injecton over this crap any day.,5,1,2
"I have been on U-500 ( a highly concentrated insulin) for over 5 years, I take 20uts 3x daily and 50uts of Levemir at night.  My A1C was always between 11-13. I was taking equivalent of 300 uts of reg insulin a day with Levemir at night.  I started on the 100mg and now I am taking the 300mg.  I am down to 5uts of U-500 3x daily and 25uts of Levemir at night. My sugars now average at 120 and are never over 140 (even with a slip) and my A1C is down to a 7.1.  All of this in under 3 months as well as 25lbs lost.  I can say nothing bad about this medication.  The few side effects are worth the effects and what would happen if I stayed at the high's for much longer. ",5,5,5
"really hoping this will work so I won't have to do insulin, but I can't tell much difference in #'s so far.. 300mg, I didn't want, so I asked for 100mg..Seems like my mouth is SO DRY most of the time, and I'm trying to stay hydrated too! Med has only been out since March 2013, so still very new.. I'm also not taking my regular fluid/bp pill, so I'm having swelling in my ankles and feet I'm assuming is from that?? very frustrated, and eating everything!!",5,3,3
I took Jardiance 10mg for 4 months and my A1C went from 7.7 to 8. I also started losing my hair after 2 months.  No issues with thyroid - it was tested.,4,1,1
Jardiance helped me loose 25 lbs. I didn't have any side effects at all. I have Kaiser insurance and was only paying $45/month.They have now denied the medication after being on it for 1-1/2 yrs. I am very angry as this because my experience was awesome. I'm still fighting it.,5,5,5
"I got enrolled in the savings program and it would  cost me $77.00 every month, cant afford that and it is with the savings card too!! So I actually never got started on it, physician prescribed something else.",1,1,1
This is best treatment for me due to my issues with swelling/edema. I can walk so much easier and not get winded so much. Plus the strain of all the fluid was a factor in my frequent migraines. Since starting this medication - no migraines!!!,5,5,5
"Took Jardiance for 4 months.  Did not lower my A1c at all, but my fasting bloodsugars were great! I could not tolerate the side effects though. I had chronic brain fog,  could not think ckesrly at all ever. I had vey bad recurring yeast infections that would come back as soon as i would finish treatments with Monistat and diflucan.  And a very bad UTI that is taking a long time to clear,  even after stopping Jardiance.  Also starting this month my insurance required using other meds before they would pay for Jardiance.  So, Either way I HAD to get off.",3,1,3
"Within 3 days I had a RAGING yeast infection so much so I was bleeding.  I googled the drug, figured it might be the drug, and it totally was.  3 days after stopping medication, I was yeast infection free.  Why do drug producers do this to us???",1,1,1
extensive side effects took2 months then stopped as made me feel terrible . Side effects inluded frequent and urgent peeing. Constant nause. Weak leg muscles. No appetite. Weight loss 11 pounds in 2 months(i was not overweight) . Higher morning glucose results,3,1,1
A1C has dropped from 6.9 to 5.3.  It seems to help me lose weight by excreting glucose in urine.   no bad effects.,5,5,5
Fucking shit reklams,1,1,1
Be very aware of the side effects.   After 3 days I ended up in the hospital via ambulance in ICU.  Never would have thought this drug would almost kill me.  So be very careful and don't ignore side effects. ,5,1,1
"Started taking Jardiance on July 16th. My A1C was at 8.0. Eating junk most days, no exercise.  I started a daily fast walk of about 2.5 miles, started eating better, and with the help of Jardiance, the pounds starting flying off.  I've lost 25 pounds since then, and my A1C is down to 5.5.  Couldn't recommend this more!",5,5,5
"I started using Jardiance July 1, 2018 in addition to Glimeperide and Metformin ER. My A1C has been between 7.2 and 7.7 for the last 3 years. The goal was to get it down below 7. My A1C this week is 6.4 down from 7.2 in June. I have had no side effects and highly recommend this drug. ",5,5,5
"I started of using 10mg of jardiance which had little effect on my sugars, but did drop my A1C from 7.8 to 7.2 in 3 months. I did ask Dr. to increase the dosage to 25mg due to my sugars where still ranging over 250. after 3 weeks, my sugars have basically leveled out. The highest I have had was a 177. Cannot wait to see what my A1C looks next time I'm at the Dr. office. Future looking good at this point.",4,4,4
I was glad when I took up this option as I really didn't want to take up injections. It has definitely brought down my A1C but the side effects and overhead is overwhelming. Constantly drinking water(80-100 floz) to avoid yeast infections or UTI and still got affected. Eating portioned sizes to avoid ketones in blood stream. Joint pains moving from one joint to another. ,1,1,1
"My doctor prescribed this for me in March.  My A1C is lower than it's been in years and I've lost 20 lbs in 4 months. No signs of any UTI.  But, I drink more than a gallon of water a day.  I've always drank a lot of water.",5,5,5
WOW I really did think that this was a diabetic dream come true. Until one week after taking the medication I developed an yeast infection. I was prescribed fluconozole and it went away. Only to be replaced by having my vagina becoming very sensitive and uncomfortable. I later noticed that the inside and surrounding area was starting to swell. I have stopped the medication and slowly getting back to normal. I had lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks and my blood stick was never over 150. I will so miss it. ,1,1,1
"Started on this drug one week ago.  Was ok at first, a bit thirsty and frequent urinating.  Within one week developed yeast infection.  Burning sensation and very uncomfortable.  Not for me. ",1,1,1
"Love this medication. I was taking it for 2 yrs, lost 8 lbs and my A1C went from 10.0 to 5.9. However, my insurance company refuses to pay for this wonder drug. Can't believe they can dictate our health. Now I have to go on Farxiga and if that doesn't work Invokana. I don't even know if I'm going to bother.",5,5,5
I lost a hundred pounds using this drug in two years.  That and once a week trulicity,5,5,5
"Got my A1C down quick, insurance forced a change to Invokana.  Didn't work, bad side effects.  Then they made me try Farxiga, didn't work, bad side effects.  Back on Jardiance 2 days and BG down into target and I feel soooo much better!",5,5,5
" 6 Months ago I started Jardiance with a A1C of 12.9, after 3 months it went to 9.2, 3 months later I'm at 7.5. Off one shot of insulin.Oh and I feel great!",5,5,5
"Hi, I too had awful yeast infections, even after I stopped taking Jardiance. It did not lower my A1c, plus my right kidney was in allot of pain, until I stopped this medication. It is not for me.",1,1,1
"One yeast infection in the beginning of use.  Otherwise, it has worked well.  Still waiting on A1c results and I lost a couple of pounds.  Hope the generic works as well.  ",5,5,5
I took Jardiance for almost a year - while it lowered my A1C about 2 points and I lost some weight - the UTI's and yeast infections were just non stop. My insurance has just discontinued Jardiance and is now switching me to Farxiga - I am a bit leery after reading the reviews - might be getting into the same situation with it - but I am hopeful it works without those same side effects. If it weren't for the UTIs and Yeast infections it would be a great medicine. ,4,1,4
Caused an itchy painful rash on penis,5,1,2
"While this medication helped me shed some weight, it gave me horrible, the most annoying and brutal yeast infections! I am going off this medication. So not worth having yeast infections",3,2,4
This drug was horrible for me. It caused urgent diarrhea.  I started taking half the recommended dosage and that symptom was replaced by brutal yeast infections.  Despite treatment for the yeast infections which persisted I told my Dr. I would no longer take it. My Dr. recommended Victozia which is working for me now.  I'll never go back on Jardiance.,1,1,1
"lowered my BG from 8.5 to 5.6 in 3 months, loss 40lbs, blood pressure went down cholesterol went way down also I used it along with diet and exercise. I have been able to drop two of the meds I was taking for blood pressure",5,5,5
"I have been taking Jardiance for just over a year - I have NOT experienced any side effects whatsoever - MORE importantly this drug has reduced my blood sugar levels to an average of 5 and has maintained this level quite incredible nothing else has worked previously - I have named Jardiance as the ""diabetic wonder drug"" although my Doctor keeps reminding me there is no such thing as a wonder drug - I disagree this is MY wonder drug - thank you Jardiance you have changed my life completely astonishing result.  ",5,5,5
"Type 2 Dia for past 12yrs. Been on Jardiance for 1yr now. Best results I've had of the many drugs prescribed. I poorly control my eating and do little physical activity. Always been a ""Big Guy"" 6'1 previously 300lb , I've lost 40lbs since beginning Jardiance. My eyesight has greatly improved and my numbers are getting back to acceptable levels. Negatives: with my insurance price is still $1 per pill, urination increased but is not as bad as other describe. Seem to grave Milk (1 gallon/day)???",5,5,5
"I use to suffer from general fatigue but after starting this medication, fatigue is gone. There is a lot of urination but I'm okay with that. I've lost weight without trying and can't wait to see what my A1C results are. I really like this over metformin. Metformin was not as effective. This is great for me.",5,5,5
"I am a 49 y/o woman.  A1C of 7.0 and already on Metformin 1000mg twice daily.  Jardiance prescribed and not only did it NOT help lower my glucose, I have gotten my 2nd yeast infection in the 3 1/2 weeks that I have been on it.  Too bad too, because, as promised by my doctor,  I have lost 15lbs, without trying.  It does make you thirsty and pee a lot, but I have always been ONLY a water drinker.",1,1,1
This drug has fewer side effects than others I have tried.  It has controlled my blood sugar effectively and I can't wait until I get my bloodwork done to see if it has lowered my A1C as well.,4,4,4
This has helped me so much. I have back issues and have had to take cortisone for the pain. My diabetes was up the roof. I was put on this plus metaformin. This has been a blessing. My A1C is 6.7 from a 10.1 and along with excercise and eating portions I've gone from a size 12 to a size 7. Yes a lot of urinating but drinking water does that too. ,5,5,5
"This medication seems to provoke labored Breathing, Pneumonia type symptoms, and a hacking cough. This is the second go around as the first time I went to urgent care, they did testing found nothing and put me on an  Antibiotic and later prednisone.  after six weeks it cleared up and I tried it again, with the same symptoms which started approximately 1/2 hour after the dose. It also seems to cause Blurred vision within 1 hour after the dose. After any meal it seems to cause sluggishness, dizziness, and some chest discomfort. For all the bad symptoms it is not worth the degree in which it works. A 10 mg/Dl drop when the Bg is over 300 just is not worth not being able to move. ",3,1,1
"urination at night 2/3 times abdominal pain frequent diahrrea but found the joint pain overwhelming slowed me way down,, YEAST , YES YEAST penis area near invocanna, then farxinga to jardience because had to try the old version first insurance issues all had very similar expecially yaest and dyhydration jave me worst cholestral bad levels i have ever had",3,1,3
although I felt very thirsty and dry mouth the first few days I went to pharmacist and they got me over the counter losanges to help keep mouth wet ..my blood sugar is down finally and feeling great ..you do pee a lot more but ..trade off is good,5,5,5
Following chemo treatments for cancer my diabetes was pretty much out of control. My doctor recommended that I try Jardiance to get it back under control. I've been very happy with the results,5,5,5
"I was stuck in the low 7s for A1c readings over a year. Jardiance has lowered my fasting to a consistent 120 and afternoons / evenings to 100 range. This is just the first two weeks though. For those concerned about drinking / urinating, I'll just say if it helps prevent kidney stones (you DO NOT want a kidney stone) by increasing your water intake, etc., than that's just another added bonus.",5,5,5
I was on Metformin 2000 daily..BS was around 130 fasting...I used this drug for 2 weeks and had to stop. It made me urinate every hour night or day and awoke me in sleep every hour. I drank excessive water and had urges to add salt a whole lot to my diet. My urine was always pale or clear and not natural. My urinary track seemed irritated most of the time. This drug as a stand alone did nothing more than Metformin...,1,1,3
I've been on Metformin & Glimepiride for 8 1/2 years. My A1c had been in the low 6's until about 2 years ago when it got to the low 7's. Nothing helped - even Levemer. My doctor added Jardiance to my scripts in Feb. Just got my 1st quarterly blood work. My A1c went from 7.2 to 6.5! My bg rarely goes over 135 unless I eat something that I shouldn't. Sometimes I go for days without going over 100. Expect my next A1c to be in the low 6's. No side effects at all.,5,5,5
"My A1C has gone from 7.4 to 6.9 while using this drug in just six weeks.  In addition, I have dropped about 8 pounds without trying and I am not obese.  My doctor believes that the drug may continue to bring down my A1C even further.",5,5,5
I have been on this for two weeks and my blood sugar has lowered to the lower 100's from 300.  I do find myself drinking more and urinating more.  That would be the only side effect.  ,5,5,5
"After 8 weeks, I seem to need less attention to what I eat (within reason) and more attention to when I eat.",5,5,5
I think in combination with Glyburide/Metformin it works and lowered my sugar level from 270 down to 170 this morning,5,5,5
I think in combination with Metformin it works and lowered my sugar level from 200+ to 100+,5,4,4
no side effects so far taking this medication,5,5,5
"My a1c was 9.6, I had taken 100mg. for 3 months. Its 6.1 after taking half pill for the next 3 months it went to 5.1. No side effects so far. I walk 1.25 miles daily and try my best to have a 60 carb or less intake. Having had Sepsis shock two and a half years ago. I have to keep a close eye on kidneys do to the loss of 50%. But numbers are looking good. Thank God!",5,5,5
"After 2 weeks I developed severe case of dysentery diarreah went through 30 pairs of underwear overnight could not stop crapping in my underwear in bed at night woke up vomiting dry heaves, dizzy, sweating shortness of breath, too weak to go to ER I called an ambulance and received an IV drip with morphine to stop the severe pain of stomach cramps which incapacitated me.  Spent 2 days in the hospital.  Felt like I had a heart attack.  I almost died. The diarreah dehydrated me left me weak as a kitten for weeks.",1,1,1
"I was taking Janumet (Januvia Metfomin 50-500 mg)twice a day more than 4 years. Initially, my A1C1 was 10.8 and less than one year with this medicine, food control and light exercises my A1C1 dropped close to 6. Past 3-4 years my A1C1 was 6.1 to 6.3. In December 2017 my insurance stopped paying for Janumet. Now I am taking 100 mg of Januvia once a day and Metformin 500 mg twice a day. This is really not working. With food control and exercises my A1C1 is now more than 7 and fasting blood sugar is always more than 160. I am trying to get my old medicine again. I recommend Janumet but not Januvia.",5,1,1
"This drug almost killed me!  My entire body was numb and tingling for 3 months.  I was in ER twice, admitted once ,had thousands of dollars in test and I am happy they were all normal. Once I stopped the drug it took 3 months for the symptom's to stop and co away! I did report this to the drug company.",5,1,4
"I started out on metaformin once a day, then went to twice a day, levels and A1C started going up again, then add Januvia seemed to help at first then I stared gaining weight and sugar levels and A1C started going up again, added trilicity shots once a week seemed to be doing ok, now the levels and A1C are climbing again. I stopped the Januvia because of the joint pain I was having and the sugar cravings. Been off it about a month and my levels are not any better so heading to the DR again to see what to try next. I think diabetes drugs are a joke the are not made to help for a long time before you have to add another pill or shot to keep things working. Big pharm making some money off from these for sure.",1,1,1
"I have been on this medicine for 2 weeks, since Metformin stopped working.  I am experience anxiety and also sleeplessness.   I don't really see a change in my sugar numbers at all. ",5,3,3
"I started Januvia 100 mg twice a day with Metformin 1000mg.  It worked great at first, and brought my sugar levels down,  Then I started developing severe lower stomach pain, and was treated for Diverticulitis, which I believe the Januvia caused. During this time my sugar levels started going up, it was like the Januvia just quit working.  I was switched to another Medication, but a year later was put back on Januvia, this time I immediately gain 5 pounds after starting it, and have been experiencing swelling and tightness in my hands ",3,1,3
I have taken januvia for two weeks.cannot give proper answer,5,4,3
"Could not take metformin at all, did not agree with me, even the XR. Started on Levemir then DR added Januvia. Taking for almost two months now and have found my A1c coming down and blood sugar readings improving. Only side effects I have noticed is runny nose and some stomach discomfort that has gradually decreased. Runny nose could be from post virus that I got so will see if that goes away as well.So far this is working for me.I have joint pain but cannot pinpoint if it is from this drug, statins or just old age!",4,3,4
"Couldn't take metformin due to diarrhea and stomach upset. Started Junuvia and it seemed to be working great, my A1C went down. Then I got something similar to psoriasis, swelling of legs and feet, severe fatigue, pain in the feet and legs, back ache constantly, weakness, more things than I can say has happened. My A1C elevated, sugar will not go down below 140 usually a lot higher. Can't see that it is helping at all now, will discuss with dr going off this medicine. All over feel bad, would rather take shots and feel better than this.  ",2,1,2
"I had been on 25mg of Januvia daily for 4 months in conjunction with Metformin ER then my DR upped Januvia to 50mg.  WoW!  The side effects of the added 25mg were horrid.  First, my fingers got stiff and my finger joints hurt.  Next, my fingers started to swell. Then, the diarrhea started and got worse over time. When the dizziness started, I got extremely nauseous and had the dry heaves.  So, I finally read up on Januvia and saw the side effects and stopped taking it 4 days ago. The dizziness was the first to go. The finger swelling was 2nd. The finger joint pain was 3rd. The diarrhea has continued to rage.  Went to the DR today. She thinks I have parasites and refuses to believe that Januvia causes diarrhea after being off it 4 days. So, tomorrow I get tested for parasites and I also have to go back on the Januvia. I'm not pleased with the side effects of Januvia and I'm not pleased that my DR doesn't know about the side effects of this drug in conjunction with Metformin ER.  Grrrr    ",1,1,1
Horrible progressive skin rash,5,1,1
"I was able to maintain good fasting and A1C results from 1992-2004 just with diet and exercise. In 2004 I had to start medication and used Metformin in increasing doses from 2004-march 2016 when my A1C shot up from mid 6-7 results to 8.2! In March 2016 I started Januvia until present.The ease of use is wonderful compared to those horse pills of Metformin and stools are normal again for the first time in years... Unfortunately, I have seen no change in my A1C (still at 8.2) and fastings have increased to 140-170.  My doctor is going to try Invokana next.",1,1,1

Been taking Metformin 850's twice a day for about 3 1/2 years now. My glucose has been getting more difficult to manage with diet and exercise. My previous A1c was 6.6. Now it's 7.3. I was surprised it rose so much. Just started Januvia 50mg 1x/day. Only been on for 5 days and already I see results in my daily readings. I am hopeful I don't get any of the side effects mentioned in many of the previous postings. I will follow up in about 30 days. ,5,4,5
"Started Januvia 2 weeks ago and immediately started experiencing migraines that woke me up 2 to 3 hours earlier than my normal wake-up time, causing me to struggle thru my workday highly fatigued. I've been on metformin 500 mg 2 x daily with no side effects.  Januvia has NOT improved my mg/dl numbers.  Plan to discuss discontinuation of Januvia and possibly increasing daily metformin dose w/ my Doc. ",1,1,1
"I started using Januvia 100mg with Metformin 500 mg 2xs a day about 2 weeks ago. My numbers have never gone below 149 and I have severe joint pain. The pain is in a knee that I was already having some issues with, but this exacerbated the issue. I didn't realize until all that time that it could have been a side effect. I am stopping it immediately and will follow up with results.  ",2,1,2
It worked good for the first two weeks then  I started itching constantly.  I stopped taking the meds and the itching went away.  ,3,1,1
I have noticed my stomach area feeling sore and my hair changing since I have been on this medicine for 3 months. I rather use my Metformin 1000mg because it flushes me out more than this medicine. I didn't like it.,2,2,2
"Abdominal pain nausea. My globular filtration rate went from 82 to 44 after two months. A second test a month later and it was 44. He has not yet retested for protein in my urine, but there is now foam in my urine.",2,1,2
Januvia has been great for me so far. No side effects and it quickly lowered my glucose levels. The in home self testing my levels have gone from 200-300 to 132-148. Will have my A1C tested by doc next month. It was 8.0. I take 1 100mg tablet a day after dinner. Metformin was a horrible drug for me. Couldnt tolerate at all. Burning legs and arms and severe stomach issues. Stopped a few days after stopping Metformin. Heard you cant stay on Javuvia very long. Dont know why. Will have to see what doc says but ive overall been satisfied with this drug. ,5,5,5
I was taking januvia for high blood sugar levels called pre diabetes . I have been on it for over 5 years . In the last couple of years I have been suffering with very painful ice cold hands most of the time . I went for all kind of tests with no answers . As I have had bad side effects with other drugs I thought I would skip the januvia for a time . After about two weeks off januvia my hands started feeling normal again . It has been a couple of months now without terrible hand pain . I am done with januvia and will try to control sugar levels with diet . ,3,1,3
first my A1C was 5.8 and I was taking Metformin only.  My doctor added Januvia 50mg 2 times a day.  I could not afford the drug so called drug company who offered the drug for free after meeting their requirements.  My A1C is now 5.2 and with exercise I have lost10 lbs.  I did have side effects such a fatigue and headaches but the symptoms lasted a short time.  As soon as my A1C is stable I will discontinue the medication per my doctor.  He checks my blood every three months,5,5,5
 Good side effects:  weight loss and works good as a laxative.  Bad points: cost and lack of effectiveness as a glucose controlling drug,1,1,1
"Diagnosed 2/2015 and put on insulin and Metformin. I have had issues with Metformin from day one. A1C starting was 11.7. Change of diet, exercise and added Januvia a few months after. & months in and A1C is at 6 but steady abdominal issues continue to increase. This started before Januvia. Going to see about removing or reducing Metformin. My life is hell right now. Sure my sugar levels average 85 to 110 but not worth the constant cramping and diarrhea. Jury still out here but seeing as it started with Metformin, that's where I am starting. Reading up on Berberine 500mg homeopathic (NOT a drug),for future reference. ",5,5,5
I have been taking expensive Januvia for six months and see no results.,5,3,3
"Within a couple of days of starting the medication, I began having headaches and upper respiratory issues. I took the drug for 2 weeks & discontinued as the side effects were becoming debilitating.  Within 24-36 hours of discontinuing the drug, the side effects went away. I would not recommend this drug due to the side effects.  However, it did bring my blood sugar numbers down from the low-200's to the 140's. If you can deal with the possibility of side effects, the drug is effective.",5,1,4
it almost sent me to ER. my heart rate went very high? Also was not effective. Dangerous stuff!,4,1,1
taken for one month in efforts to control out of control blood sugar levels. Immediately noticed increased thirst to the point it became severe - me carrying a 32 ounce glass full and drinking it constantly (up to two gallons a day of liquid) and yeast infection appeared.  Changed medication to another brand. Was not a good experience at all!  Weight gain because of excessive fluid intake. ,4,1,1
Where do I start. I have been taking Januvia for about 7 years. Started out good controlling sugar levels with my insulin. Gradually over time the symptoms have gotten worse. I am tired all the time. Muscle pain and weakness. Congested all the time. Trouble breathing. Trouble sleeping. Blurry vision. Constipation. Swelling of legs and feet. I have also gained about 40 lbs since I started taking it. I could go on but needless to say I am fed up with it. I am stopping today!,3,1,2
"My husband took this for about one month.(metaformin for a month before until stomach issues were a problem.)  Januvia made him like a zombie.  Chronic fatigue, always sleeping, vacant look on his face, no zest for life.  Now he is taking actos, it's been 2 weeks, but these side effects haven't changed.  See the Dr soon to see if there are other issues happening.  I wonder how others are faring on the medication.  I'm exhausted and frustrated from googling.",5,2,2
Nothing but shooting insulin has ever lowered my sugar levels. I starting taking this drug and it has dropped my sugar level to normal levels and I have lost 30 pounds.,5,5,5
Helps but not by much.,5,3,3
My husband took 100mg Januvia for 10 days with no obvious side effects until today.  He is retaining fluid and when weighing himself gained 14 pounds without eating differently.  Being active and preoccupied over the holidays masked this gradual change.  It should be taken off the market and reevaluated by the FDA.  ,5,1,1
"I'm on two insulins (Lexapro and Novolog) and then took Januvia, also.  Rash developed after about one and half months.  Severe itching and swollen face and hands and feet.  Don't eat salt.  Did lower blood sugar some.  Metformin used to work good, but stomach pains, etc.  Had to go on insulin.",4,2,2
"I have been on it for almost a year and it hasn't improved my sugars or A1C very much. But it has been effective at causing weight gain, erectile dysfunction which I never had before (I'm 40) even with high blood sugar. It's very expensive but fortunately I have good drug coverage and pay a $70 copay for 90 days worth. ",5,1,2
"All this medicine has done is give me a rash. Swollen face, massive shivers, not any fun. Oh yea here is the plus, it has RAISED my numbers by over 25 %. I would never recommend this drug to anyone. ",3,1,1
"The price of this drug is unreal!!! Doubled in price, and with insur.,  in 2 months. Can't see that it is effective in keeping my night-time sugars down.",1,1,1
Caused upper respiratory issues. ,1,1,1
I think it's a crime to charge $395 for 30 pills.  What is really confusing is that they won't let me use their coupon even though my insurance pays them $320 every month.  I have a copay of $75 and thought the drug company could pick up $70 of that so I would pay the $5 that other consumers pay.  It seems like the middle class is not being treated fairly.  Rich people can afford the pills and poor people get them for almost nothing.  Why do those of use in the middle class have to pay $10 a pill??               ,4,1,4

Januvia 100mg without dr telling me side-effects.  Finally realized that a dr diagnosis of hsvII was actually blistering side effect from Januvia and ear congestion that reduced hearing level was also from Januvia.  Went off Januvia and blistering went away immediately.  Ear congestion improving every day; I will have hearing tested again in about 2 weeks to compare hearing tesitng while on Januvia compared to post Januvia.  Still upset about the hsvII diagnosis - been married 22 years and thought husband cheated on me - he tested negative so he thought I cheatedon him.  I got retested and was negative - what a circus.,3,1,3

Hopefully soon I'll be able to get outside & walk. I'll stay on it till I see my dr in 2 months. Surely it will start bringing down my  BS level. My dr said if I loose weight, I have a good chance of getting off of all diabetic medicines. I've tried to read & learn all I can. This med does have a lot of warnings of bad side effects of which I've not had any signs of yet. I just don't understand why it won't lower my BS level a lot more.

My prescription drug insurance increased my co-pay from   $35 per month to $88 per month. this equates $1.16 per tablet (one per day) to $2.93 per day. the insurance's cost did not  change.

"I've been taking Januvia about 7 or 8 years and it has worked well for me.  I do try and eat right and exercise some.  But recently I heard it causes pancreatic cancer, that has caused a concern for me.  2 days ago I started the Metformin 1000 mg. once a day.  I know it's early in taking it but my sugar has started being in the 200 and 300 hundred range.  I will give it another days or so to see if it does better.  I still have the Januvia and I will start taking it again if my sugar levels don't come down.",5,5,5
my blood sugars have been stabilized at 6.0 for 6 months.  I do have to eat every 3-4 hrs or my sugars get low.,5,5,5
Allergic.  It was helping the three days I was on it and was feeling a bit better but I developed a rash and hives on day 3.  Replaced with Glyburide which I was allergic to as well.,5,1,1
Just began using it two weeks ago.,3,3,3
"After first three days I saw a 50% drop in my blood sugar levels than usual. This while continuing exercise, diet and Metformin. This medicine allows me less of a strain in maintaining exercise which I do now every three days instead of two. Only side effect is swollen rear side of tongue but subsiding now since taking medicine every other day with same results. Have been on it 2 months. I'm satisfied but closely looking out for other side effects. So far so good.",5,4,4
Terrible drug. makes you even sicker than metformin. Together just they just make your insides CRAPPY and painful. Doctor would not believe me and tested me for intestinal problems( colitis and spastic colon) WROONG!!! Took mtself off this drug and feel great!!! Been off three weeks and my numbers went down!!!!,1,1,1
"Has worked good for me so far, sugar has gone from 8.8 to 7.2. Good watch my eating a bit more closely. Taking one  100 mg per day. I sent a form into my doctor that I got from merick,to get some relief on the price on a thirty day supply, paying 70.oo ",5,5,5
"i was on Victoza and had blood sugars of 107 in the mornings. Insurance would not pay for it so they put me on Januvia, My blood sugars are now 130 to 150 and i am very tired most of the time.  It isn't much better than Metformin in my opinion and now i am having back aches which may be related.  I have been on Januvia for 6 weeks.",4,1,1
"For those you that are complaining about the cost, you can get a card from manufacturer and the cost will drop to 5.00 for a 30 day supply.  You can't be a state or federal employee to get this, but you can have insc or Medicaid.  I have been taking this about 2  yrs.  My insulin levels are going up instead of down.  In the last year or so I have had some horrible side effects. I do not know if it is because of Januvia or not so will not blame it on that.  I will stop taking it and see what happens.  However, reading the posts on here makes me think that my symptoms are caused by the med, because they are the same as some of you list.  thanks to all for sharing and  good luck.",4,2,2

"I have been put on this medication since being diagnosed with Type 2 in 2005.  I'm on Lantus and Humalog insulins and other diabetic pills.  I'm concerned that the directions say not to use with insulin.  Also concerned about attorney commercials saying did you have pancreatic cancer while taking this drug.  (Yes, I know not to believe what I see on TV) I did not find that my blood sugars were any leass after being on this med., so I am giving it up completely untail my nextq doctor appointment.

I've had Type 2 Diabetes since 1997. In January 2013 my Endocrinolist put me on Januvia after I went into total kidney failure. Thank goodness! I was on 15 - 20units of Novolog each meal & 25 units of Lantus every night. My sugars were never under170-180. Since taking Januvia my sugars stay around 90-130 steadily. No highs and very few lows (only if I don't eat enough). I am thrilled to finally be off the Insulin train!,5,5,5
"I was on genuvia for 8 months and it did a good job in controlling my glucose levels though I never reached optimal levels.  However, my bladder started acting weird; I couldn't void completely and my urethra was killing me with the pain...I couldn't even sleep at night...getting up every 15 minuties within one hour to try to void.  I finally just stopped taking it and my bladder woes just went away.  This is a terrible drug.  I don't recommend it to anyone.  Especially it you're on it and start experiencing bladder problems.  Get off of it today.",4,1,1

Ive taken Januvia for 11 month since I was diagnosed diabetic. The medicine worked really well at first but doesnt seem to have any effect over the last 2 months. I have started to have a sharp shooting pain in my stomach over the last 2 month also. This medicine causes bad leg cramps and makes me lightheaded at times. Starting to wonder if I should stop taking.,4,3,3

"I was on Januvia for three years and it kept my blood sugars in check... or so I thought. I was also very careful with carbs etc. I went to a new doctor this week and he told me that it is .10 effective with most people in lowering their A1C in studies. There are class action law suits now claiming it causes pancreatic cancer. Now that my blood sugars have gone wild and seem to have no intention of coming back, I'm on two different insulins. One big ole sarcastic 'thanks' to the pharmaceutical company that makes this expensive crap. ",5,1,2

I have also had some groin pain.  I also take livalo for cholesterol problems and experience the same type of pain.  Not sure if both meds are causing the pain or just one of them.  I tried taking metformin (500 mg 2x daily) and my blood sugar went way up.  This is all new to me so I'm not real sure how to handle all of this.  Could use some encouragement.",3,3,3

"Not sure of the effectiveness/satisfaction of it yet, just started taking this about 2-3 weeks in.  I've noticed when I would walk I'd get a sharp pain in my toe/ball of foot area.  Not sure if it could be my shoes, or if it resulted in me sitting with my feet arched(look like i have heels on, but didn't) I just brushed it off like I'm just experiencing the norm, but then it happened again.  My legs would feel numb at times. Not sure if it could be my lounger..or slightly cramped. Not bad/sharp pains or anything..just the occasional stretch would do. I had stomach cramps like in my pancreas area..it would come and go when i first started, but after taking it- I do not experience it anymore. I do experience the occasional diarrhea though when taking metformin(2,000mg a day) as well as januvia 100mg. Alot of gas/air in my stomach when I first started. I felt really bloated, but not so much anymore.  I'm giving this a shot.  If it benefits me and works out fine..why not.  If not, doc and I will find alternative means. :-D",5,3,3

I was diagnosed last year as diabetic. Initially bs was >340 and A1c 10.8. After taking metformin, cinnamon pills (500mg) and ocassionally glimepiride my A1C is 7 and bs avg 130. I will continue to use cinnamon pills (caribbean antidote) and my metformin...and of course exercise and watch my diet. But at this time, I do not want to introduce more meds into my system. If my A1C rises or bs increases then I will consider going back to glimepiride....but I have opted to not take Januvia at this time. Thanks to all persons who posted reviews!",3,2,3
Stopped taking it because of the high expense when are they coming up with a generic?,2,2,2
I took this and Janumet and once evry 3 months went through a period of vomiting. The januvia would cause food to putrify in my gut and then be vomited out. I worked with my Dr for over 1 1/2 years to find the cause. I would never take this medicine again!,1,1,2
"Took Janumet...a combo of metaformin and januvia for all of 1 day... suffered stomach pains back pain, swollen legs and hands also headaches ... will not take again if my life depends on it...I would rather die a natural death than be killed slowly by this drug...",4,1,1
"I thought the pain meds. that my dr. put me on was causing the itching...come to find out, it this medicine. I started taking it about the same time as I started percocet..turns out that it is the Januvia 100mg.  Thank you so much for the other people writing in on this...now I know it's NOT just me!  Thank you so much for this info.",1,1,2

"I have been on a few different medications for lowering of bloodsugar that have sent me to the restroom all day long. This one has not done that to me and I am happy with that. It is very expensive but you can go onto merk.com and print out a perscription assistance program application. Have your doctor fill out the necessary information send it in to merk and you could get a years worth of medication for free. You can also print off a coupon for a one month free trial take it to your pharmacy and get it for free too. At my pharmacy it was going to be 279.00 for one month and I will be getting it for free. You can go online for many different drug companies and they too will have perscription programs for those who can not afford the medication. The income limit I believe is very high, a fimily of three can make, I believe, 78000.00 a year and qualify. I just wanted to get this informaion out there for those who need a little help.",5,5,5
"Prior to Januvia, I was on Advandia which made me ill and kept me with lows.  Januvia controls and I have minimal lows or highs.

"I started to take 100 mg Januvia, when my feet started to hurt and had a seering pain in my colon at night. My feet started to feel like they had a uric acid attack, and I started to feel a lot of pain if I tied my shoes too tight. I was on januvia for about 90 days. Since that time, I have not been able to get my blood sugar below 350, regardless of what I try. My feet still hurt, but they are slowly improving. I can at least tie my shoes and walk without pain, but my joints between my toes feel like they still have some uric acid crystals. The feet are very sensitive, so I have to watch what pairs of socks I need to wear.  I didn't ask for januia, but a doctors recommendation.  I had some surgery lately and the doctors were concerned about my fasting high blood sugar, which was 349, and after a couple shots of insulin, the blood sugar would not drop, but infact went up to 400. Even after several hours, the blood sugar only dropped to 350 +/- 10, but has consistanly been around 300-350, regardless of the medication I take now.",3,1,1
It has been very satifactory.,5,5,5
I have switched to my old treatment and I was pretty normal when I started this med.  Since I took this my sugar count shot up and it hasn't come down since. It put my sugar out of whack and it has made it impossible for my sugar to return to normal. ,1,1,1
I still have trouble with elevated  AM fasting glucose.,5,3,3

Only side effect to note is slight dizziness.I don't know about other peoples symptoms but be aware that doctors advise people to quit drinking and smoking because these two things alone can cause respiratory symptoms and pancreatic problems ESPECIALLY IN DIABETICS.Remember colds and flu also cause respiratory problems.Use an elimination process before jumping the gun unless your symptoms are acute or severe in which case seek attention promptly.

Anyone have any recommendations? I am ready to live with high sugar and off the meds. I never have a good day of feeling good. Terrible way to live...miserable. I am not overweight and slim frame.

Weight Loss & Blood sugar under control from 10.5 to 7,5,4,4
I have been on metformin and glypiside for 6 years. Tried actos also but it made me nausus and swollen. Tried Januvia 100 mg a day and what a difference. I have had no problems so far but I'm just a little worried because I've already had acute pancititus not by using this drug though.,5,5,5
I was on Avandia for several years. I gained weight and requested the change. I had to pressure my MD to change it. This was a year before the press on Avandia.,5,5,5
My fasting blood sugar is in the 80's or upper 70's.,5,5,5
"It brought my awakening finger stick sugar level to 100-115 whereas Actos had no effect whatsoever. However, my 2 hours after meal levels are still too high.",5,4,4
this is really of a good benefit for my state and it lowered my blood sugar level from fasting test (132) into ( 108) only a  light temperily pain in my kidenys after urinating from time to time ,4,4,4
Initial response was severe heartburn.  After stopping with the third pill I had a severe case of hives over entire body.  It was very expensive and I was not given a trial first from my doctor.,1,1,1
Have been on Januvia for 2 yrs. and my husband also. Taking 100mg. a day. Was very happy until I started having upper abdomen pain. Had lab work on my liver done and it came back with pancreatitis. Doctor took me off of med.'s right away and have started me on a new med.,5,4,5
high blood sugar for the birds,4,3,3
Januvia has help me lose weight and keep my sugar under control.,5,5,5
I think this januvia is increasing my bs than lowering it. It also caused me back pain since i've started it about two years ago.,1,1,1
"Have been diagnosed at A1C 7.5 a year ago and now 8.5.  I am allergic to almost all diabetes meds (runny nowe, congestion etc.) I could not take one type of insulin because I was allergic to it, switched to Januvia about 3 weeks ago.  I am very satisifed with it so far.  I also have a ulcer, highatal hernia, and severe acid reflux.  I may be dehidrating will write more later.  My readings are in the 180-250 range.",5,3,3
I don't feel that this drug has improved my diabetes.  Will keep trying!,4,3,3
I started taking Januvia about 1 year ago when diagnosed with type 2. I have developed Pancreatic disease since taking this med.  Also my bs has increased. I am not only discontinuing the use of Januvia I am also contacing th FDA with the serious health problems it has caused me,5,1,1
I've started this medicine to help control  my weight.,5,4,5
Was not controling BS spikes.  Has not decrease my A1C levels.  Started on Glimepride 2 mg daily alony with the Januva.  We will see,5,2,2
"used to take metformin until lost lots of weight and was off drugs for 4 yrs.Restarted metformin when a1c went to 8. Had bad muscle and bone pain that I hadn't had since stopping Metformin. MD switched me to Januvia 4 mos ago. I read comments about side effects but since I am trying to avoid insulin I thought I'd give it a try. Things went well for about 3 weeks then started to have severe muscle and bone pain-worse than when on Metformin-that progressed over the next 2 wks. Also had constipation, vivid dreams and headache. no depression but overall not feeling up to par. After 5 weeks gave up on Januvia and after several days symptoms reversed. Pain was severe and was afraid of permanent damage but don't seem to have any. I'm calling the FDA to report. How many people go through treatment for arthritis or other problems that are caused by meds?",4,1,1
I have been on this medication for a little over a month... The first two weeks my blood sugars were in the 320- 394 range.  Mind you before I started Januvia I was on Metformin and Glyburide and my blood sugars were constantly in the upper 500's.. Now after a little over a month they are in the mid 100's!! I no longer have to deal with high blood sugars or horrible side effects from the Metformin.. I would definitely recommend Januvia!,5,5,5
"After 31/2 weeks on Januvia, had almost daily severe headaches, some constipation, muscle swelling, and increased blood sugar readings of at least 40 mg/dL.  This medicine needs to be withdrawn by the FDA ",3,1,1
I have experienced severe indigestion after taking Januvia. The indigestion felt like my chest was on fire. I quit taking it before I was able to evaluate the effectiveness in lowering BS.,5,1,1
"Well I have been on this for two weeks and it isn't doing a thing!  We added Glyburide once a day in the morning and it isn't helping either.  Why won't my sugar come down!!  I don't want to end up taking shots!  Have to call the doctor back tomorrow with my results! We'll see what she says.  It is expensive but a little hint, I checked out their website and was able to get it free for 30 days to try!  Also got a coupon for the next refill, if there is a next refill!  Also check out Actos's website, they offer a $50.00 rebate if anyone swithes to that! ",5,1,1
"I have been taking Januvia along with Metformin for four months. My Blood Sugar is right on target, which it wasn't when taking only Metformin. But, since I've been taking Januvia I have chronic sinusitis, constant headaches, severe intestinal problems, occasional nausea and fatigue. Until reading the information here it never occured to me that it could be the medication.",1,1,5
I am anxious Annie when it comes to taking medicine...I was scared to take it at first reading reviews u hear good and bad..I have realized we are all different and our bodies react differently..I have been taking this medicine for 4 months..only side effect I had was upper respirtatory symtpoms..could be the weather or medicine overall I am very grateful for this medicine my blood sugars are within normal range and I no longer am afraid of low blood sugars which I experienced with Byetta.Some people have said they have read about pancreatitis but I think all the meds relating to DM can cause it..since your liver and pancreas work together... U never know until U try.. Good luck everyone hope it works for u,5,5,5
"i just started Januvia a week ago and my sugars are starting to be satisfactory, in the 120 range. But i am having horrible INDIGESTION, a constant burning in my chest. Has anyone else had this side effect?",5,5,4
"Can't rate this drug yet, starting it today.  Hopefully it will bring my bs to normal, looking foward to once a day pill!  Didn't do too good with taking pills several times a day!  I'm nervous about all the side effects I'm reading but just tried Actos and my bs was way to high and didn't see any change after starting it.  Wish me luck!  I'll review this again in a few weeks and let you know how it goes!",1,1,1
I don't think it is working to control my blood sugar.My friends who takes also told me it is not helping them.,4,1,1
"I've been using this drug for 2 years and haven't had a problem. However, I saw an article about it causing pancreatitis and I had that about 30 years ago and wonder if I should change, but don't want to put on weight which others often cause. Anyone else had a problem?",5,4,4
I have used this drug for 9 months and it has helped me alot,5,4,4
i've been taking this drug for 3 months now with lower dose of metformin and now have kept my sugar levels between 78 and 140. my a1c is 5.1 best it's ever been.,5,5,5
"I had severe joint pain in my hips, knees and ankles. After stopping this on the first day all of that disappeared. I also had sever gas. Will never take this drug again.",5,1,4
"When I first starting taking Januvia I was told to take it at night.  I took it shortly before going to bed and could not fall asleep.  I then started taking it after dinner and would be able to fall asleep, but would wake up after 1-2 hours. I began taking it in the morning with breakfast and my sleep was not interfered with (or at least I slept better.  I inquired and was told insomnia was not a reported side effect of the drug.  Has anybody else experienced this side effect???",1,2,3
It worked for me but my ins refused to pay after 2 months wanted Dr to prescribe  a lower cost drup.Now taking actos  with metformin.,5,5,5
ok,4,4,3
I take Januvia in conjunction with Glymiperide. Once a Day.,5,4,4
Been taking for 2 months almost.. No side effects for me..Love just taking 1 small pill.. ,5,5,5
I never had the up set stomach like i did with other medications that i have taken.,5,5,4
"Started on 1/2 normal dose for one week. BS readings in AM went way up but PM did not change. Headaches and dirrhea started second day, but quit by the end of the week. Worse problem was increased heart rate. I have had past heart problems and by-pass, but normal pulse was about 66. With this drug was constantly getting pulse in the 80's and 90's (at rest) So I consider it dangerous and not helpful.",5,1,1
     My doctor started me on Januvia three weeks ago. He gave me three weeks worth of samples and told me to come back in three weeks for a check up to see how the Januvia is working. For two weeks I kept a nauseated stomach both day and night. I became constipated and felt awful. Headachs were constant and it felt like my stomach was extreamly bloated to the point it felt like I had a baseball in my belly. I didn't know what was going on  I finished taking the three weeks worth of samples and the very next day I began to feel so much better and by the second day I felt like a new man. I will never ever take Januvia again.,3,1,1
Taking 100 mg of Januvia for a month now and no side effects. Also take Lisinopril & Lovastatin...,5,5,5
"No apparent side effects, taking with Metformin and Lipitor. Also, just read Dr. Barnard's book on diet to control diabetes and after 2 weeks his suggestions are having a bigger impact than the medication over 6 months.",4,4,3
"I was started on Januvia 4 yrs ago or so and was doing well and blood sugars were under control and then had to stop and take actos because of high cost of januvia.  Was able to switch back to januvia 5 months ago, since when on actos had increase in weight and sob.  Feel much better on Januvia although so far have not lost any weight.Blood sugars run around100 to 140.  ",5,5,5
Januvia was prescribed following the unsuccessful use of Byetta for 2 years. Januvia with Glimepride has brought my levels from 300 to the 90 to 120 range.,5,5,5
ONly been taking 100 mg Januvia for 4 days but so far no side effects. Some of these reviews kinda make me nervous though.,5,5,5
"I've not experienced any side effects, but also it hasn't worked that well.",5,3,3
"After reading the comments on this board, I am more than a little afraid of this drug.  I have been a diabetic for only 3 months.  When the doctor checked my blood sugar in July my blood sugar was 398 and the A1C test was 11.9.  He put me on Metformin 1000 mg twice a day and Glipizide 5 mg once a day.  After 3 months of taking my medicine and watching all carbs and sugar that I eat, my A1C ws 5.9.  I have lost 28 pounds and monitor all carbs and sugars extremely carefully.  My doctor just prescribed this medicine for ""sugar spikes"" that are showing up on my meter.  I will take Januvia for a month and see if it helps me.  ",5,1,1
"I have been taking this drug for 2 months now. My #'s are back to normal. I do have pain in muscles and some stiffness in joints, but overall it has worked for me. The only thing that really bothers me is the constipation. Not Cool.",5,4,5
"After taking 5 pills I started to have flu like symptoms. My body broke out in hives. I landed in the ER for severe itiching, leg cramps my body took a blow I had to take off from work because I could not stop stratching and treatment given for allergic reactions to DM patients was limited. Two weeks later I have hives and black marks all over my body. The VA ER could not believe the condition this med put me in.",1,1,1
Januvia has helped control my blood glucose levels pre and post-prandial. I have not had any prolbem with hypoglycemia and do not need insulin.,5,5,5
"I was on 100 mgs of Januvia. My sugars stayed high, I felt really bad, no sleep, I finally stopped eating. ( I never felt hungry and food made me sick.) My Dr accused me of not taking it, cause my A1C's were at 12. I took the darn things, they didn't work at all.",5,1,1
"This drug has been working for me. However it is very expensive,even with insurance deductable I can not afford it. Looking for a drug with same effectiveness",5,5,5
"So far, Januvia has helped me loose 20 lbs and I feel great and have been working out.I am using it in conjunction with 2000 mg of Metformin a day. I go to my doctor for my 3 month A1C test so I will see if it is helping. So far good on my end:)",4,4,3
"Been on this medicine for 3 months, severe constipation, stomach bloating and some leg pain but I also take Zetia which has the same effect alone. The #'s were higher while on the pill and just overall felt uncomfortable.  Stopped taking all meds and will watch my diet and exercise to try and keep the #'s down.  That has to be better than feeling like that.  No BM for days and that is after talking all kinds of pills to help.",3,1,2
ITS BETTER THAN HAING TO WORRY ABOUT GOING TO LOW.,3,3,3
possible hematuria after beginnning this medicine.,4,3,4
"After one week of Januvia, my seasonal sinusitis progressed rapidly to complete nasal obstruction, pansinusitis and shortness of breath at rest. Vision clouded and progressed to retinal bleeding after a coughing spell. Blindness corrected by surgically draining bloody fluid from each eye. This was a bad trip but better than death by pancreatic or kidney failure.",1,1,1
"Have been taking this medication for about one month. It seems to be working. I feel more energy and my eyesight has improved. I was also taking Actoplus+met (with metformin). This was a bad combination. The metformin drug was too much and caused some swelling and hard for me to breathe, restless at night. I discontinued the Actoplus+met and Januvia medication has made a bigger impact on my numbers. I was reading about 200, now reading about 150 on glucose monitor. Think the longer I use, the better it will be (also include more frequent exercise and better eating habits--I am working more on this.)",5,5,5
"I was very pleased with the effect Januvia had on my type 2 diabetes.  However, my doctor changed my oral diabetes medication & now my #'s have gone up.  Hoping to return to Januvia.",5,5,5
"Well, this is my follow up review of Januvia. I went to my doctor on 8/18/09 because my respiratory problems had gotten worse. I could not rest, day or night, because this medicine had caused a respiratory infection with wheezing.  I told my doctor and the doctor acknowledged that this was one of the side effects of Januvia.  I was placed on antibiotics and given a cough medicine.  I am still having breathing with wheezing.  I have never had asthma or any symptoms before my staring Januvia.  I was told by doctor to stop taking Januvia. But I told the doctor I took myself off of this medication about 9 days before coming in to see doctor. I'm afraid that the side effects are not going away soon.  My body feels better since getting off, but still have some wheezing and coughs.    ",2,1,2
Still don't know enough to rate it.  I only started Januvia about a week ago and my readings are quite high. 12.9 and 9.2 on a good diet.  Does it take a bit of time to kick in? or should I give up???,4,2,2
"Januvia, lowered blood sugar readings with in normal range (less than a 100) also take Metformin 5/500mg twice a day (2 pills) since taking Januvia noted tiredness, contipation, slight headaches, itching, less sleep and sinus issues at night.  Other than that Januvia works for me.  Only been taking 2 weeks.  Will make a months use my validation point to determine next steps. ",5,3,5
Blood sugar levels decreased.,5,4,4
"I have been taking 100mg for 2 months and I have experienced joint pains, body aches, headaches, constipation. I have been having serious breathing and respiratory problems with congestion. This medicine has made my life miserable. I feel worst taking it now. My daily activities have been sluggish and depressing. I am going to stop taking this medication because I think it is causing my body more physical problems than the manufacturer wants you to know.  I have had serious constipation with stomach bloathing since I started this medication.  My glucose levels really haven't changed that much. I am going back to my regular medicines, glipizide and methformin.  I think there should be more indepth research done on Januvia.  It has been too costly financially and to my general health.  My heart beats very fast and I feel so tired all the time. Very disappointed and I hope there have not been permanent side effect damages to me. ",2,2,2
"I was on insulin 2 x daily. I began taking 1000 megs of Cinnamon daily. After four months, my Doctor took me off insulin. I then began taking Januniva 100 Meg 1 x Daily. With insulin, my readings were still in the 150 range. With Cinnamon and Januniva, my readings run from 75 to 110. I am very pleased and feel great.",5,5,5
My glucometer reading have gone from in the 200`s to low 100`s--feel very tired and severe flushing feeling at times--2-3 bm`s a day,5,3,5
I HAVEN'T TAKEN THIS MEDICATION. I WILL BE STARTING MY PRESCRIPTION ON 08-06-2009. JUST GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DRUG BEFORE I START TAKING IT.,5,5,5
For the time being januniva has kept my blood sugars level.It took over a year to convince the insurance co to pay for it.,5,5,5
Effectiveness This drug has worked fine for me.  The problem is that it too expensive to use about $178.00 for 30 pills.,5,4,5
"I have been having a dry throat & my feet,knees & legs are in alot of pain.Now I can't believe all this pain is coming from my pinched nerve in my back !Tired all the time & no get up & go & very depressed !",4,1,1
dose not seem to work.blood sugar still high most of time.,5,1,1
i love it and it helps,5,5,5
"My husband has been taking this for about 2 mths along with Actos and it has lowered his blood sugar, but way too fast. It takes it down to 50 after 1 hr of taking it. He is sleepy all the time and has had no energy and it make him want to eat more. We will be discussing this next mth at the Dr's visit",5,3,3
"Lowered my blood sugar. Leg Pain severe, ankle and knee joint stiffness muscles hurt to stand.",4,1,4
Lowered my blood sugar substancially,5,5,5
"I was prescribed metformin and avandia 5 years ago. Now have kidney disease in stage 3 with filtering of the kidney at level 41. Metformin and Avandia caused this problem.  Was then put on Actos 30 Mg. daily and Novalog 70/30 flex pin. Actos has made my weight go up and now I have swelling in my feet and legs.  A few weeks ago the doctor decreased the Actos to 15 mg. and added Januvia 100 Mg. daily.  The dr also decreased the Novalog 70/30 to 10 Units daily.  Due to the headaches, tiredness, itching, muscle pain, runny itchy nose, I am now told to stop taking the Januvia and watch the blood sugars that I may need to increase the insulin again.  The Insulin (Novalog 70/30) causes more weight in my middle. Also lab work today revealed decreased iron levels. Now have to take iron supplements. ",5,1,3
Great med for Blood /sugar control. The only drawbacks are the incomplete bowel movements one experiences with this medication . All else works well !,5,4,5
"Januvia work very wellin taking down my blood sugar, but it made me so sick I missed a lots of days out of work, because it gave me a Upper respiratory problem. It cause me to have bronchi. I still have the cough it keep me up at night and bother me during the day.",3,1,3
"my mother is taking januvia and she has no energy, and her blood sugar has been far far too high, like in the 350  range and thats not right at all.  all she has done is sleep because she has no energy, and no gumption to do anything, and on top of all that, she is so sick to her stomache that she isn't even hungry because nothing even tastes right.",1,1,1
"After only two doses I had extreme muscle soreness and aches and could hardly get up and down.  I also had swelling of face and hands,headache and a cough. I am not on any other meds.  I tried metformin before this and could not take it either.",4,1,1
"MY BLOOD SUGAR IS UNDER CONTROL, WHEREAS BEFORE I BEGIN TAKING JANUVIA IT WAS UNCONTROLLABLE DAILY. ",5,5,5
"Regularly taking this medicine,cure my nerves pains, type2 diabetes and Blood pressure.Side effects may be stiffness of joints specially in hand fingers at night while in sleep. Otherwise this is a wonderful drug, but expensive. ",4,5,4
I've been using Januvia for 2 weeks. I have pain in my fingers and arms along with muscle pain in my legs.  I'm also very constipated.  I've read that others have had this problem - I will discontinue the use of this drug until i see my dr again.,2,1,2
"i take januvia100 mg and actos 45 mg i find that my sugar lowers quite offten. i have never had a kidney function test, i feel ill i know something is wrong with me i just dont know what it is",2,3,2
"I have taken Januvia for 4 weeks, my blood sugar has gone up since I started this drug. I also have leg pain that I have not had before.  My muscle on one side is very hard and hurts when touched.  I stopped this drug 3 days ago and pain has started to get better.  ",5,1,1
HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING BLOOD SUGAR,5,1,1
After taking januvia 100mg for 2 wks. I developed extreme itching and a bad rash. I went back to Actos.,4,1,1
This is awful! I have experienced sore joints hips/knees. I have gained 4lbs in 2 weeks. I have had a sore throat and sinus problems within the 2 weeks. I was told to stop taking it to see if I had noticed any difference and guess what? LOST the 4lbs and NO MORE joint pain and NO MORE SINUS problems! I have a follow up next month to see what other meds other then Januvia and Byetta would be helpful.,4,1,1
"follow up to my previous post.  I am the person that was doing the dash diet and excercise and tried to drop the januvia.  After 5 days without januvia my physical symptoms were better.  No knee pain, no muscle  pain, i stop feeling physically bad.  One bad thing though from going cold turkey on the januvia is that i started to get depressed and could not sleep.  I felt like I had drug withdrawls.  could not sleep at all, worse than when I was on the drug.  I guess the body gets used to having the drug in the system and goes in shock without it.  i finally broke down and took one quarter tab just to have it in the system and feel better mentally.  Once i took a quarter pill i felt a little better in the head.  It seems to work so I wonder if a step approach is required in order to not have the system go into shock.  I guess after months on the drug the system changes and you cant just flip it back on the drop of a dime.  i will talk to my endo and see what they think is the best approach to get rid of the pill.  I will go back to lantus instead of this mess.  ",5,1,1
"i started on only metformin only.  My doc did not like the H1C reading and so he decided to have me try Januvia.  I had the usual stomach problems and it was ok.  I decided to kick into high gear my exercise routine to 2.5 miles in the treadmill and 5 miles at night on the bike.  I started a modified DASH diet. After 12 weeks in Januvia i started experiencing weird symptoms that I had never experiece.  I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 6 years ago and was an lantus and step scale insulin. I was on lipitor on an off for six years and lisinopril.  So i had never seen the weird symptoms before the Januvia.  In the past 3 months i feel like i have been in a daze.  Twice I went to emergency thinking I had heart problems. I would feel lathorgic during the day, i would get paranoid, had wild mood swings, elevated pulse, muscle pain, joint pain, problems sleeping, sensitivity to light and sound.  It would get to the point that I could not be at a store that had bright lights because I would get dizzy and have vertigo.  I decided to stop taking Januvia when I got pain in my left knee and started to have depression. My knee felt so bad that I had to quit my morning runs in the treadmill and the biking.  Not good for someone who wants to loose weight.  I started walking slowly again on the treadmill and then all of the sudden I pulled a calf muscle just from walking fast.  I went to emergency thinking i tore a muscle, but it was only a pulled muscle.  I stop taking januvia 3 days ago and have traded my morning run for a 5 to 6 mile bike ride and kept the evening bike ride also.  My calf muscle is better know since I am off januvia but I am still having sleeping problems.  The light sensitivity is gone also.  No more halos on lights and the intensity of the light has disappear.  I think i rather take lantus once a day instead of dealing with side effects. That helped me lose weight and was off all meds and insulin for two years until i started a job that required long hour",5,1,1
IT mad me sore in the legs and in my wrists and hands I took for a month and now been off of it for 3 weeks. i still hurt and been sucking down pain killers. I will never take this again.,1,1,1

"After taking Actos and Glyburide for many years and ballooning to 316 pounds, I switched to Januvia and lost 30 pounds in three months.  Only problem was my blood sugar went out-of-sight, totally uncontrolled.  Because my kidneys were starting to pay the price, I'm now on insulin.  Very depressing.",5,3,1
"I started taking in and it controlled my B/S i was in the 400's and it brought it down to near normal readings sometimes it got 2 low even in the middle of the night, i now keep peanut butter and crackers in my desk at work and oj in the fridge in case it drops to low again, i feel really good and am so happy that i have near normal readings my A1C went from a horrible 11 to a 7.0 i will continue to use it.",4,3,4

When I stopped takeing the medicine I got stomach cramps, a lot of gas, and the runs. This medicine is supposed to help? Oh I also take glyberide/metforim 2.5/500 3x day.  I was given the junuvea because after two years glyberride/metforim allowed my A1c to climb from 6.9 to 7.8. With No change in diet. ",4,1,3

Managed to get a Sprite and back to bed. I could barely walk. I thought stroke, but was hoping it was reaction to Januvia. I'm a female 69 years old and it scared me so much. I stopped taking it and will call my dr. Wonder if FDA is aware of these effects and should a recall be made?",5,1,5

I've also had some leg cramping and muscle tightness.  My stomach seems jittery all the time.  Glucose levels during the day were actually low, but high in the morning.  My hemoglobin A1c came down from 7.5 to 7.1 in 3 months but I do not feel well on this drug and prefer to try to control my diabetes through diet and exercise.

When I explained these symptoms to my doctor, he just said ""Keep taking it; the symptoms will get better with time."" He's not my doctor any more. I would not be a bit surprised to hear in the future that some people have died or been permanently injured due to Januvia.

I had only had 4 periods in 2008, but the last 3 mths have been regular but very heavy(can't really leave home for about 1 week). I have pain in my fingers, ankles & hips. Pain so bad at night I have trouble sleeping. My dr says its arthritis, but after reading all the comments that people have made, I'm beginning to wonder. I will continue to take it to see what happens.",5,4,5
I do not think this medication helped me at all,4,1,1

"I had diabetes, type 2, for eight years. During this time I went from Glucotrol XL to insulin(110ml a day two shots, morning and night. I also take Avandia 5mg. My sugars always ran high 280s. No control. then my doctor said people have gotten great results with Januvia. I thought... we'll see! I have been on Januvia (100ml 1 a day mornings)for about 10 days and the results are astounding! I went from high 280s to 140s waking reading! I stopped the second shot and decreased the first significantly 35 ml due to hypoglycemia, so Insulin and Januvia are a very powerful combo. For the first time I am greatly optimistic that I can get off insulin with this wonder drug Januvia, and maybe one more bg lowering pill! No side effects yet! I'm feeling better overall because of the lower sugar levels, and control of this condition is now within reach! A change in diet(avoiding sugar)and more excercise(just walking) is doing wonders! I am actually looking forward to my next appointment, and getting off insulin! I love the way it works by helping your body make more insulin(for type 2s)and gets your liver to decrease sugar production making your body perform close to the way it should. It's a  1-2 punch that's doing the trick! Thanks Doc,WebMD and all of YOU reviewers for your comments and ideas! Your experiences are invaluable! That's why we read them! :)",5,5,5

I was dizzy, chest colds, Very bad headache, Both hands were numb this was worse at night I would wake with my hands hurting I still have some numbness it is off and on and and mostly in my fingers now.

I hope my side effects are not long term and no damage was caused and with time will go away.   ",5,1,2

I have been on Januvia for about 3 months now.  I had very good results in reducing my post meal blood sugars for about 3weeks. Post meals averaged about 115-130.  After that my post meal blood sugars have steadily risen to the range of 150-190. It also reduced my A1C somewhat from 8.0 to 7.5.  ,5,3,3

My doctor had me drop the Glucotrol XL and start taking Januvia. I've always had problems with my 2 hour after meal readings. My first day of taking Januvia, my 2 hour reading after breakfast was 140! It has always been around 160-190. What a difference on the first day.

"I have been taking Januvia for a month and my glucose stays in the 120's.Has help alot,I feel better.Ask your doctor to let you try this medication",5,5,5
"after starting Januvia my a1c levels jumped 2.5 to 3 points from prior readings so now my levels are in the 10.5 and 10.8 range. My bs readings went from the 200's to constantly over 400 sometimes off the meter. Developed acute abdominal pain, became lethargic, had breathing problems, GI tract problems, experienced chronic heart abnormalities and pain, night sweating, severe vision problems with double vision, and developed severe muscle pain, spasms and weakness.  I stopped Januvia for 3 months and tried again and started to develop the same medical problems within 1 week and stopped again. I will never take the drug again.  I have not recovered to the point of when I started Januvia in 05/2007 to 07/2008. I feel this drug was not fully tested before general public usage.  I feel this durg could kill.  It was my primary physician who worked with me and NOT the endocrinologist who ignored my constant complaints and said it has to be working. ",4,1,1
I have had more sucess with this pill than any other diabtes pill avaible on the market today!!!!!!!!,5,5,5
"I was on Januvia for about 1 months when I started having left neck swelling and excruciating pain which quickly affected the entire left side of my face to the point where I couldn't keep my left eye open.  I had trouble swallowing. Ibuprofen helped the pain, but ultimately I had to quit Januvia.",5,1,4
"Woo hoo!  No more debilitating diarrhea and stupor (glucophage & Metformin), no more excruciating pain, swelling and bloatedness (Actos), and no more blood sugar readings all over the chart!  I am ecstatic and extremely pleased with Januvia!  This drug is the first to successfully lower my blood sugar readings to within normal ranges after fasting and even after eating... and without any side effects!",5,5,5
"I have been on Januvia for 6 months. It took about 3 months for the sinus issues to clear. otherwise no other side effects.  my a1c is 6.3% down from last test.  the medication is working.  I am very happy. it is costly even with insurance but Diabetes is so dangerous - it is worth it.   dont give up, re: the initial side effects, they will go away.  ",5,5,5
"I have been taking the drug for 2 months and my BS readings have dropped to within normal ranges.  Side effects have been heart palpatations, loss of apetite, and nausia.

"Started on Januvia when it 1st came out as I was diagnosed with Type II the same week and then the company that I worked for switched insurance companies.  The new company forced me to switch to Actos.  I gained 35 lbs and went crazy on the doctor. Needless to say, my doctor was nice enough to find a way to get me back on Januvia.  I range from 90-120 and I've lost 10 lbs.  Someone should do something about the insurance companies forcing people to stop taking meds that work and forcing them to take drugs that don't work!",5,5,5

"I'm taking Amaryl and Gluphage for several years but my blood sugar was always 145+, docotr put me on Januvia, blood sugar went down to +-120 and my eye vision improved, but I started getting really severe headaches. They stopped after I discontinued Januvia.",4,1,4
This has been a godsend. Actos was driving me nuts. I gained about 25 pounds since on Actos. Since changing to Januvia I have lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks with NO change in my diet--either type of food or amounts. I have a consistant blood reading of around 160 every day. A little high but way better than being all over the map with Actos. I have had no adverse reactions like I did with Actos either. ,5,5,5
"I am a registered nurse and newly diagnosed Type II Diabetic (December of 2007).  I have never been overweight, but have a family history of diabetes.  I was put on Januvia 100mg every day in Dec. of last year, and it helped immediately even causing some very low blood sugars.  Starting around March/April of this year, my readings started getting higher.  I also have increased my exercise and have lost 22 lbs which is alot for my size (petite).  This past month, my fasting blood sugars are almost always >200 and my random's are almost 300.  I haven't had many readings <200 lately at all.  My diet is not perfect, but I do follow closely counting carbs, using sugar free/low carb products, and limiting starches.  It is very frustrating that I am spending the money on this ""new"" pill and doing all the things I'm supposed to do and it doesn't seem to be doing any good.  I see my doctor tomorrow and do not plan to take anymore Januvia-will ask for glucophage/metformin.  Also, I am scared of Januvia after researching online articles related to increased cancer incidence associated with Januvia use.  Side effects I have experienced include:  low energy levels, headaches, hip joint pain, & left ear pain.  Hope to find something more effective.",4,1,1
"I was diganosised with type II in januray 2008, my a1c was 9.7. The doctor put me on Janumet 50/500 1 tab BID. I also took the diabetic class through out local hospital and learned not only about being diabetic, but how to change your eating habits to a more healthy diet. ALso exercise plays a big parts in the control...medication alone will not do it. I have lost almost 40 in 6 months. At my last doctors appointment the blood work showed that my a1c was doen to 5.0 my doctor as me ""what the hell I was doing."" He was very please with my results. If all continues on I will be taken off of my high blood pressure and cholerstrol medication. I have had no side effects at all which is really unusal as I am allergic to 9 different medications. My only drawback to this medication is the cost with it being a new medication the co-pay is high actually the highest tier with my insurance. The God my doctor can give me samples.",5,5,5
"IT DIDN'T REALLY HELP WITH WEIGHT CONTROL AS MY DR PROMISED, BUT IT DOES CONTROL MY BLOOD SUGAR. WENT FROM UPPER 200'S TO AN ABSOLUTE HIGH OF 164! I AM ACTUALLY LOOKING FOWARD TO MY NEXT A1C! WHOODA THUNK IT ?",5,5,5

I feel better than ever and if Januvia works for you, it seems to work well. I am taking Metformin XR 500 2x a day I had issues with my numbers rising in the morning, I started with regular release metformin, but when i switched to the XR the numbers stablized.

"My husband, age 71, was prescribed Januvia, 100 mg/day,in Dec 2007 in addition to the glipizide and metformin he was already taking. It did lower his BS somewhat—he saw more readings under 100 mg/dl and fewer over 220. On the downside, as the weeks went by, he was feeling more and more lethargic; had less energy; felt cold all the time, especially at night; experienced severe nocturnal leg cramping; had persistent, severe constipation which led to his abdomen being hard and distended; and his blood pressure began creeping up. He also noticed a loss of taste and smell, also of balance and stability.  In other words, he was feeling pretty crummy. He lasted on Januvia less than three months, from 21 Dec 2007 to 2 March 2008 when he stopped taking it. Within a day or two of stopping the Januvia he began to feel like a new person. Januvia being the only new addition to his meds, it was the prime suspect. Generally, he is feeling much better, most of his adverse reactions having subsided; however his BP and BS levels are still higher than before Januvia which have him concerned that Januvia might have changed something, hopefully not permanently.  He now gets BS readings routinely in the high 200s, whereas pre-Januvia he would have to enjoy a dish of ice cream or a big meal out to get those readings. It is as if the glipizide and metformin are no longert effective and, despite cutting way back on carbs and increasing the exercising, he is finding getting back into control is more difficult than ever. Is Januvia going to be another drug rushed to market before adequate testing was done?",4,1,1
"Am a registered nurse, not overweight (139) but with family hx of diabetes. Have taken Metformin 500mg daily since 2002.  Random BS levels varied 90's to 150's, A1C varied between 6.7 and 7.0 but I'm not 100% diet compliant.  Doctor started Januvia 100mg daily in addition to metformin to see if we could lower FBS and A1C. Instead, my BS levels have jumped from low 100's on metformin to nearly 300 by adding Januvia. I get a very strange ""just not quite right"" feeling and my energy level has plummeted.  Until adequate testing proves the long-term effectiveness of this drug, I will NOT take it again.",1,1,1

After adding Janument at 1000 mg per day for the last 6 months in my 3rd month I started feeling very fatigued, having cravings to eat more, soreness and body aches and swelling of my entire body but especially my legs. I would suggest anyone taking this medicine and that also has high blood pressure to not assume that your swelling is coming from that and to tell your doctor if you are experiencing more tiredness,fatigue and body aches than usual to consult with your physician concering this medication called Janumet.",5,1,3

I take his with Glimepiride and it works great. I was skeptical that one dose a day could work for 24 hrs but it does. I finally get blood sugars of 97 to 115. Normal on metaformin was near 150. It's the best thing since baked bread.,5,5,5
"No real difference, Metforman still most effective for me. I've stopped it after 3 months.",5,1,1
It's not as effective as Avandia in controlling my blood sugar but on the other side Avandia is thought to cause congestive heart failure.  This drug is extremely expensive and is not covered by Medicare.,5,3,3
"Since using Januvia, my blood sugars are not dropping below normal which was the original problem. They are now going above normal ranging from 140 to 300.  This drug was suppose to manage the glucose levels, both high and lows, but it is not effective in controlling the highs.",5,2,2
"Since being on this the glucose levels are not controlled. I had to be off Avandia, and now this new med in ineffetive!",4,1,1
"I was on another medication for type 2 diabetes and it didnot work for me. My doctor didn't want to take me off of it because he said it work for most people. Well, I change Doctors and the new Doctor stated me on Januvia 50 mg in the AM and 50 in the PM and it started to work at the end of the week, no side effects, my number was very close to normal and I feel GREAT . I even lost weight while on this medication. My husband is on 50 mg a day and doing great with no side effects.",5,5,5
"Januvia (with metformin) has worked very well for me so far (3 months), with no adverse reactions. My doc wanted to take me off Starlix (w/metformin), which worked very well but did cause some very low blood glucose after meals. I resisted but finally agreed to try Januvia. Glad I did. Once a day. Almost no super low blood sugar. My A1C dropped from 6.3 to 5.8. My average glucose is about 105. A few highs, almost no lows. Morning glucose does seem to be a little higher than before. Weight stable. No changes in energy, muscle or joint pain. No one knows the long term issues, if any, but so far Januvia is working well.",5,5,5
"25 mg of Januvia creates a higher than normal AM fasting reading, leaving the conclusion that 25 mg is not enough or once per day is not adequate dosage.",4,3,3
"I take januvia at night time, the reason I am telling this is because someone said that it makes them tired, so why not take it after dinner? So far so good. I also take metformin. I have lost 16 pounds so far. Before this, I had gained 30 pounds with avandia. My feet don't swell up like with avandia. My a1c went up just a bit, got to keep an eye out on that, now it's 6.9, otherwise I am very happy with januvia 100mg once a day.",5,5,4
I have been very pleased with this drug.  It has not given me any side effects.,5,5,4
"I have been on Januvia for almost three weeks. I enjoy he ease of tkign one pill a day and no insulin shots. I have lost already 5 lbs, adn I dont know if it's th emedicine or what, but I completely satisfied.",5,4,4
"Family member had a rash with this medicine, and a friend said there was a new warning posted about a deadly disease called Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with Januvia.  I didn't find it in WebMd though.  Is it true?",3,1,1
This drug changed my life. My mind seemed to become clearer. Blood sugar dropped dramatically and energy levels increased greatly. Excellent drug for me anyway.,5,5,5
I have been on Metfromin for 3 years with excelent results a1c is 5.2. I now take januvia once a day also and have had no adverse effects and do not have after meal spikes when I have eaten a high carb meal.i have only be on it 3 weeks so far so good. ,5,5,5
"Had nausea every day all day from the 2nd week of taking this drug. When I consulted with my doctor she didn't want to take me off of it since she felt it was worth staying on. I wanted to lose weight yes but not when I am so sick to my stomach I have no desire to eat at all. I was forcing myself to eat one meal a day and that usually didn't sit well. As all diabetics know we are supposed to eat no less than 3 meals a day and with me skipping meals due to no appetite was the worst thing I could do at this point of my treatment. If your doctor puts you on this medication and you are sick like I was, don't take no for an answer sinc it is YOUR health not theirs that matters and how you feels factors into that. Since I went off the Januvia I have not been sick to my stomach at all. I didn't see much difference in my blood sugars while on it either and since switching to glipizide my numbers are going down.",3,1,2
"I've been taking januvia for three months, and noticed a weight loss of 15 pounds during that time.",5,3,3
"I take one a day with metformin and diabeta but my sugar is still in the 220 to 290 range.  Am I taking too many sugar meds? I also take heart meds, water pills and have a pacemaker. Is it possible some of my meds are causing my sugar to rise.  I'm on a strict diet i.e. no salt, carbs, sugar, etc.",4,2,2
not sick from it but should i be taking this with lantus?,4,3,3
"My docter gave Januvia to help loose weight before I do end up with type 2 diabetes one day since it runs in my family. She first started me off with the lowest dosage of metforin. The side effects I was experiencing in just 2 weeks were awful. muscle pain, headachs, hotflases, muscel and joint pain. Didn't even want to excersize because the drug made me very lathargic. In addition to all this I broke out with pimple like I was a teenager. That was the worst side effect off, I'm still trying to get my skin back to normal after testing the metformin for 2 weeks. Then my doctor gave me Januvia, it seems to be working ok.It's very easy to take. Other than feeling tired after I take it doesn't last very long. However I did start to break out again, so I'm going to do some research as 2 these diabetic medication and acne.",5,2,2

"I'm maxed out on metformin (850 mg 3x/day) and glyburide (5mg 4x/day).  Januvia, even without the other 2 meds, had my readings in the desired ranges in a day.  It's only been 5 days, but so far VERY GOOD!  Thanks!",5,5,5
"I've been taking this pill for about two years now. No side effects, lowers my sugar levels and helps me to lose some weight, I think is a very good drug.... so far! ",5,5,5
"I've only been on this pill 3 weeks so far, no side effects and my cravings for sugary foods and constant hunger have ceased..  I'm very impressed so far I hope it continues this way.  Blood sugar readings have been consistently between 80 ",5,5,5
I found this drug to be very tolerable and extremely effective. I was disappointed to find I experience odd side-effects of chest pains. My doctor first thought it might be a separate issue. But each time I went off the medicine the chest pains ceased. When I took the crushing chest pains returned. I really like the way it controls my blood sugar and was so disappointed to discover that I can't take this pill. ,5,4,5
thismedication has helped me a lot,5,5,5
"Jentadueto kept my sugar level low but could not handle the chills, weakness and tired feelings. ",3,3,3
I used this medicine for  three months.  My sugars lowered but I started having extreme belching attacks and then diarrhea daily. I had an endoscopic exam and biopsies of my small intestines which were negative.  I stopped the medidine and all my problems went away.  Drug did not work for me.  ,4,1,2

I have used this insulin for 7 years now. I use Tradjenta along with it and my blood sugars run 150 when fasting. it helps keep my numbers lower. I am satisfied with it. And I have no side effects. ,4,5,4
"Actually, I have a question about this drug.  Several months ago I started to share the insulin with my cat who is also diabetic.  I know, I know; this sounds totally nuts.  Be that as it may, I recently noticed that both my cat and I are losing our hair.  As the cat and I have no other factors in common besides the insulin, I wonder if that's the problem.  I am not putting this product down as its worked very well for me in the past but could there be an issue due to poor storage, a bad batch, an out-dated vial, or who knows what?",4,4,4
"I had one of the worse reactions to this drug. As soon as I injected 12 units I immediately threw up. I had the worst stomach pains. After three day, I stopped taking it and I called my Doc, who sent me to the ER. After many hours, the ER doc said I was fine. (This was about 24 after my last injection.)  My pains did go away. I will not take this medication again. I gave my pens back to the doctor. Has anyone else had this reaction. My doctor thinks I'm crazy. ",1,1,1
"I have been on this for over a year. I requested a long life insulin as the pills (Glyburide Metformin) had stop working.  I was informed of this 5 years ago that this might would happen. No problem, lantus is easy to use and controls my blood sugar when I stay the course of doing the right thing.  I am up to 60 units in the morning.  I take it in the morning so it will not interfere with my evening cocktails.  This was a suggest made by friends of mind on this medication.  I did inform my doctor and he was ok with it.  I eat right and exercise so as of now no known side effects. So far, I have nothing bad to say about it. Like everything in life you have to adjust to your situation.  I do have Metformin as backup.  That is mostly when I travel and over indulge I will take it in the mornings. I drink plenty of ice water during the day which also helps with keeping blood sugar under control.  From reading the reviews, I notice most of the men had issues with this. FYI, I am a Black male with history of diabetes.  I also know that I may have to switch meds again in about 10 years. I was on glyburide metformin for 10 years.          ",5,4,4
Twice now the pen has jammed with 30 units remaining. The product is expensive enough without having to throw it away because the pen is impossible to use.,2,1,4
"I was on Levemir since first being diagnosed in 2010 and was happy with it, then this year my insurance said they would not cover it any longer so switched to the Lantus.  Every since I started my weight has steadily increased and weigh more now than I ever have even though I have cut back on eating badly and added more exercise.  NOT happy with the results at all may look into getting back on the Levemir at least I wasn't gaining weight as much with it.   ",5,2,5
I tripped lantus insuline injection on my finger which is used to my mom. I want to know that Whether  side effect is there for me or not and also Is any blood related diseases may come or not?,2,3,3
"Due to crhons i had to take prednisone my blood sugar was up to 468 . Lantus helped bring my blood sugar down to 209 and with my humalog, now  that i am off pednisone, my blood sugars run 108 to 150 . Of course what you eat and how much   you eat effects  my blood sugar and determines how much humalog i take ,I also take 1000 metformin as i am very insulin resistant",4,5,5

It is still not getting my blood sugar levels down.  Use with Metformin HCL 1000 mg 2 pills daily.,5,3,2
"This was one of the worst drugs i have ever taken.  It made my joints and muscle very sore, i had problems sleeping, concentration level was terrible.  It also changed my mood, depressed with a very short fuse.  This is not me on a normal basis, pretty happy person.  My blood sugars came down for me but at a price on my body.  I quit taking the medication and the horrible side effects  are slowly going away.  My doctor of course has said it does not cause these side effects.  They always say this they need to take some of this shit and see how it feels.  I have had trouble controlling my sugar levels and all the medications that i have taken make me feel like shit.  Tired of being a test dummy for my doctor and these drug companies",5,1,4
"this treatment has helped me tremendously, and allows me to control blood glucose to stay between 97 - 140 ",4,5,4

I got up to 70 units twice a day with little results and stayed in a1c range of 12.3 got pissed threw stuff in trash blood levels droped almost 50 points at end of 3od day  druggest gave me Humulin R it is a otc drug taught me how to use it have learned amount needed as to what I eat blood suger range is avg 118 must use a strip before eating anything so proper amount of insulin is used I was hard to learn fingers sore from using 5 to 15 samples a day to monitor blood sugar levels but worth the cost difference we figured about 650 amonth with lantus VS 80 with approx 3 viles of humulinR that is a savings of 7000 a year plus I feel better.,4,1,1

I have gained 15 pounds on this medication. But it has help drop my BS,1,2,3
I was on this med starting mid 2010 for a year and just again. The same thing is happening again. AM sugars down from 190 to 130 and PM sugars from 240 to 180 in just 4 days. Starting at 25 units and adding Victoza to see how that does. Had a good bit of nausea the first two days but its sibsiding already.

"I am a ""skinny"" diabetic.  Diagnosed at age 48, I used Metformin XR and Prandin for several years.  Those quit working and after trying nearly every drug available, I resorted to Lantus along with Kombiglyze.  The Lantus is working; so well that I have hypoglycemia during the night, a couple of times a month.  In only 5 months I have put on 10 pounds inspite of INCREASING my strenuous exercise routine in an effort to keep the weight off.  I plan to ask the Dr to consider another alternative as I cannot afford to replace my clothes and pay for my meds.",5,3,5
"i have be using a vial  and want to try the solostar pen thanks for the coupon. lantus has helped very much,i plan to learn more about it.",3,4,4
only fair,3,4,3
This long lasting insulin seems to be working well for me with my blood sugar levels. I have a problem with it burning at times of injection because of it being acidic even injecting at a slow pace. That is my complaint in the Ease of Use rating giving it only 3 stars.,3,5,5
"As long as I remember to take the medication, it is good.",2,3,3
"I had hypoglycemia nearly all my life which switched to Diabetes 2 when I reached menopause. I started on Metformin 500mg 4/X day. If I stick to an Atkins diet, I can control my BS but I'm addicted to sugar. My BS increased to 400-500 eating sweets and carbs and I started on Lantus. I'm now taking 40 units a.m. and 30 units p.m. I initially used the Pen but I had two of them jam up and I switched to the vial and syringe.  PROS: None that I can think of. If I stick to low carb, BS in <150 but probably would be without the insulin. CONS: 1. I gained 15 pounds in 2 weeks after starting and I was losing weight at that time. 2. Water retention. 3. Intermittent chills without fever (I noticed this on another posting and didn't connect it). Increase in resting pulse by 20 points and I worry about congestive heart failure with the fluid retention and faster heart rate. No known heart disease at this point. POSSIBLE SYMPTOM RELATIONSHIP: Some difficulty passing urine. Intermittent anxiety. Joint pain.   I'm also concerned about the cancer relationship study. The preservative, cresol, is a carcinogen.

"My sugar was up to 513 & Dr. put me in hospital which I was put on 2 insulins, lantus & humulin. Was doing gooder then about a week later my vision got blurry, I was cold, itchy & shaky. This past Friday Dr. took me off lantus to see if it would take blurry vision away, but so far not, so I`m wondering if it is the humulin doing it. But with the 2 insulins my sugar was gooder, but it is very scarey not being able to see very gooder. Does anyone else have blurry vision? But since I have been off the lantus for 3 nights now, I am not cold, itchy or shakey anymore, but I still have the blurry vision, I can`t drive or go any place by myself & like I said, it scares me. Before I was put in the hospital I was on 2 500mg. of metformin a day which I also still take too.",5,3,5

"Originally prescribed in hospital to offset side effect of prednisone treatment.  Worked well in temporary combination with normal insulin.  Dr. continued Lantus after hospital.  Has helped keep A1C below 7.0 for the first time in 6 years.  Used in combination with Actos and metformin.  Only objection is occaisonal pain from injection into a nerve, more an issue with the length of needle and injection site than Lantus.  Easily tolerable in the arm with a short needle or in the belly with a longer needle.  Overall, Lantus is quite helpful.",3,5,5

I was struggling with extremely high blood sugarr then I got put on lantus. Lantus has helped get my blood sugar down to normal levels. I was shocked on how well lantus controled my blood sugar! Just one shot a day and now I have tight control of my blood sugar! Lantus has been wonderful for me! Its so easy to use in the solostar pen and its painless! Lantus gets an all star rating from me it works so well! I highly recomend lantus for good control of blood sugar. I've had no side effects on lantus. Lantus hasn't caused lows like other insulin because it doesn't peak which is real nice. Lantus works extremely well!,5,5,5
"My blood sugar numbers were always high and I was struggling to control them then my doctor perscribed lantus solostar pen. Lantus keeps my blood sugar at normal levels now.

Its important to get your correct dose with lantus.once you have your correct dose it works perfectly! It dosent cause low blood sugar either like other insulin because it doesn't peak. I give it a all star rating! Lantus really works for me!,5,5,5
"I use lantus solo star pen for my injections. It has been amazing at controling my high blood sugar! The pen is extremely easy to use and mostly pain free. After priming the pen you must make sure there is not any insulin left on the tip of the needle or this will cause a stinging sensation at the injection site. This is the only time I've found lantus to be uncomfortable to inject. So if you make sure after prime the needle tip is clear of insulin, the injection will be toatlly painless! Also make sure your pen is at room tempature before injection. Lantus pen is much more convient than an insulin vial and syringe. You just dial your dose in a clearly seen window and it delievers your percise dose! No more drawing up from a vial! The needle is so small its been painless! I love the pen , its so descret you can take it anywhere and it looks like a marker pen! All in all for me lantus gets a five star rating! I'm very satisfied with this product! ",5,5,5

Been Taking Lantus for almost 2 months now and still not regulating my Sugar started with 20 units Daily now up to 40 Units and sugar still fasting in the morning is well over 200 sometimes over 300 ,3,1,2
"I was diagnosed with Type 2 about 10 weeks ago.  Dr. put me on Lantus.  I am taking 24 units each night (and Humulin in the a.m. if glucose is below 150 per dr.'s instructions).  So far, I've only needed the Humlin four times.  Lantus seems to do a nice job keeping my glucose levels under control.  Occasional spikes and lows seem to be attributable to diet choices and exercise patterns.  My only minor complaint is that my skin sometimes stings at the injection site, but this goes away within a few minutes.  Since taking Lantus, I also sometimes experience significant sweating in my sleep - so much so that it drenches my shirt (although I cannot be sure this is attributable to Lantus, and not some other medications I began taking around the same time).",5,5,5
"I was not experiencing great success with this, until I switched from a 6mm needle to an 8mm needle -- now getting great BG results!",4,5,5
I've been on Lantus in conjunction with my humalog.  I take it at night.  It significantly aids me in controlling by blood sugar.  If there is a problem it's because I'm not controlling my diet.,5,5,5
diet very important,5,5,4
"Regardless of what I eat or exercise, this insulin does not help.  I'm pretty consistent on diet & exercise.  Sometimes I think the sugar levels get worse because there is something wrong with the insulin.  Let's face it --it's shipped from Germany where it's made; how do we know how it's handled in all climates.",4,1,2
"I have only been on this for a short time and don't have really good results yet, but the one thing that bothers me is that about 3-4 hours after injecting i get really sick to my stomach, was wondering if others has this problem.",4,4,3
"I am a newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic and have been on Lantus for 2 months.  It has been a struggle to find the right dose.  However, since changing my diet to a low carb diet my Lantus dose has been reduced to once daily.  It has been very effective and no side effects.",4,4,5
I'm taking 100units every evening and bg still 240 or greater in am have been counting carbs and using novolog sliding scale with meals as well have had some sugars over 300. Just don't think this is working for me maybe need to go back to my old NPH doses,3,1,1
"I take 80U of Lantus every night now.  Started out at 40U which helped for awhile, but now everytime I go see my Doctor the dosage goes up, as my A1C's have been always high.  Since increasing my dosage I have put on 30lbs, which I am not happy about.  I also take 1000mg of metformin as well being on a sliding scale for Novalog.  I eat smaller meals now and to a certain point I try to avoid eating if possible as my bloodsugars will go through the roof.",3,1,1
"I have been a diabetic for 28 yrs. I started with Lantus approx 3 yrs ago. It controls my blood sugar very well. However, the only negative is that I was bottoming out on a regular bases at the beginning. Once my dose was regulated  I haven't had any side effects. Would recommend this medication.",5,4,5
I have been a Type 1 for 4 years and take 25 Units at night along with Apidra each time I eat.  The only thing bad is I've gained 42 Lbs. of water weight.  Somedays I'm a whole size larger than the day before.  Since I'm in my 30s my Dr. won't give me Lasix for fear of Kidney problems later.  Its frustrating but other than that it works very well.  It is very strong and took a while to get the dosage correct.,5,5,5
"my fasting sugar has been fine but my sugar is still fine after eating, sometimes 343",2,2,3
"I have been taking Lantus for 2 years now and my blood sugar is under control, and I dont find it hard to give myself the shots, I have a scar on my stomach so I dont feel it at all (unless I miss). The only problem I have had is water gain of 45 lbs in the last two years. I dont find Lantus to make me sick or tired. So alitte Lasix compaired to a stroke or another heart surgery is ok with me.",5,3,4
"I have been a diabetic (type 1) for 34 yrs and this works good for me I only take 10units and morning and 10 units at night.....YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ITS ALL IN WHAT YOU EAT!!!!!!!!!!! If you dont eat right then your blood sugars will not be right !! lows and highs !! i USE 1 UNIT OF NOVOLOG FOR EVERY 10 CARBS.. SO IF I EAT A BAGEL WITH CREAM CHEESE THAT IS APROX. 31 CARBS SO I TAKE 3 UNITS OF NOVOLOG. Look for this book ""Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter"" works GREAT. It has in this book, Diabetes Diet Guide and 200 fast food restaurants and every thing that you could think of in this book to look up the contents of it. AGAIN ITS ALL IN WHAT YOU EAT!!!!  ",5,5,5
"I have been a type 1 diabetic for 25yrs. and take Lantus 42u at night and also take Humalog at meals during the day. As long as I'm healthy and not stressed or the weather doesn't change to much, the insulin works great. ",5,5,5
I keep increasing my Lantus and blood sugars do not go down much...Watching my diet and I think I'm gaining weight.......,5,1,2
"I have been diabetic for almost 8 years and started using this insulin a couple years ago. I started out taking 14 units and I have been knocked down to taking just 4. I am concerned though because even with 4 units, I have to almost triple how much I eat before I go to bed. It is quite convenient because I only have to take it once every night before I go to bed, but the side effects can be crazy. In my opinion, this stuff is ridiculously strong.  ",4,3,3
after 2years of useage Lantus is no longer controling my blood sugars. I'm up to 20 units of lantus daily,4,1,4
"I have been on lantus for 5 years the night sweats were so bad i would change my night wear up to three times a night, and bedding. Blood suger was fair but the side affects were too much. ",3,1,3
"Up to 25mg at night of Lantus, Plus 100mg Glucophage and 10 Glucatrol. No change in high (250+) sugar readings.",5,2,1
"I have had great results with this, since I was diagnosed 11 months ago I have been on numerous different medications. My A1C b4 beginning this was 10.4, but now my b/s stays in the low to mid 100's 2 hours after a meal with a lower carb meal plan. The only problem I've had is getting properly adjusted, I take 28 units a day and have dropped below 70 and became disoriented twice, but lower dosages than that don't seem to work near as well. I cannot wait until I get my next blood results in a couple months because I finally feel as though I've gained control of my blood sugar. I hope this helps some of you.",5,4,5
very happy with results,5,5,5
I have had prety good results with this med only negative is it burns when going in and can be painful at injection site for a hour or so..,3,4,4
"take ove 85 units a day, not really helping",4,2,2
"I inject 35 units at bedtime, around 10;00 P.M.If I eat afterwards, I get diareha.. I also take 5 units of regular insulin before each meal if my blood sugar is over 120. I need more help on taking my insulin and eating.",4,2,3
not sure of side effects (hand numbness) probably unrelated. Very satisfied with steady action level. Good Basal Insulin.,5,5,5
"prefer results from prior type of insulin used, ""Regular""",4,2,3
This medication helped me reduce the number of injections I require daily and works very well forme.  I am extremely pleased with it.,5,5,5
"I have experienced fatigue, depression,chills and blood sugars are inconsistent; not stablized.",4,2,3
works fast and for long periods of time,5,4,4
"i have been diabetic 25 years and thank the universe for this medication. since cutting carbs and fruit out of my diet completely, i have reduced my lantus from 45 to 25 units.  i find it peaks on me after a few hours so i have to be careful. tried levimir and it did not work at all.",3,4,5
I am taking 50 units of Lantus and it is not helping control my sugar at all.,4,1,2
Forced to use this brand by insurance company.  Previous insulin pen was a more quality brand and the pen was mechanically better.  I sometimes have to fight with the pen's plunger as it tends to jam up.  I have to pull it out and reinsert several times.,4,3,4
If you use Medicare you are one of us being extorted by this company.  I want a long acting insulin on the market NOW to compete with these Extortionists. Price fixing used to be illegal. What happened?  Where is competition?,2,2,2
It's agony taking Lantus.  Seems to have no effect.  Going to speak with the doctor about using something else.  ,1,1,1
"After taking Lantus this morning for my first time sent me to the emergency room. I developed swollen throat, itching and heavy breathing. I spent 3 hours in the emergency room and they instructed me to stop this medication right away. ",5,1,1
Switched to Lantus Solostar pen from Toujeo.  Lantus hurts and is hard to administer.  Only on second day but not sure I can continue because of the pain.  Toujeo was painless.,1,1,4
My blood sugar levels have rarely dropped and my a1c is 9,5,1,1
"I have been on Lantus for a year. I have gained 30pds. I hate it, its not getting my sugar down. I have tried everything. I am going to ask my doctor for another medicine called Prandin, I have heard great things about it. Hope it works for me. My A1C is 7.2 before I started this, it was 4.7. Does not work for me.",3,1,1
"Solostar pen is only for the young, big handed and strong.  Delivery sysrem is difficult and results in ""adjustments"" while the needle is in to get a better grip.  Lantus itself is excellent, but looking into other options .",2,2,4
"I have been taking Lantus Solostar for over a year now and I am very pleased with it. I had been taking 90 units a night, but added another drug and now only need 60 units a night. My last A1C was a 5.6, morning sugars are around 100. Finally feel in control, now if I could lose some weight ...",5,5,5
"I am on Medicare with s supplemental Medicare prescription plan.  This drug is extremely expensive with any of the plan options.  My last prescription was $330 for 5 boxes with 5 prefilled pens which is a 3 month supply.  Since I reached my limit for meds this month I had to pay a 45% co-pay instead of a 25% co-pay. This took my prescription up to $650 for 5 boxes and a 3 month supply.  Honestly, I can't afford... Having consultaiton with Dr. in another week for help.  You aren't eligible for any help if you are enrolled in a prescription plan...  Outrageious.",4,4,4
"I have been on this 12 days aNd Im still battling a few side effects they say should lessen in time like swelling and ears ringing, injection site burn, but my blood sugar was running between 325-700 including fasting readings,A1c was 16.2. After taking Metformin and aglyburide for 2 years, eating well, exercise it just kept climbing. We tried Januvia, Piglitizone, nd sliding scale Novalog, never under 245. I am now with Lantus dropping into low 100s, Have not seen those numbers in 2 years. So far so good.",5,5,5
"I've used this drug about 9 years. Totally happy with this. My a1c is now about 6.1. I,m looking for a replacement drug as I am now starting Medicare.",4,5,5
"Just stopped taking after three years on it... by accident.  Forgot to take a shot when we went out to dinner and next day noticed no bladder incontinence.  For three years I have lived in fear of going in public due to this leakage.  Have been off Lantus for six days now and know I will never take it again.  All diabetes meds are poison and doctors should send ""new diabetic"" patients to boot camp to learn to exercise and eat properly...  and avoid these medicines.  ",1,1,2
It is easy to use and so far very effective.,5,5,5
"Im no longer taking this medicine. I was on it for more than 7 years. It didn't control the blood sugar. The provider continued to increase the dosage. Due to this I developed fear of eating. The increased blood sugar contribute to vascular peripheral disease. I believe that it also contribute to the overall pain that I use to have daily, just feeling sore all over to the point of interfering with my work and daily activity. I hated that much for I hate taking pain medicine.",4,2,2
I am new to this treatment and am in an adjustment phase.,3,1,2
"Has lowered my numbers at 85 units but still not in the normal range.  Not taking pills because of horrible side effects.  Have been on it now for about four months and am having horrible pains in my feet, back and neck.  Doc says it isn't lantus but I am not so sure.",5,3,4
"I have been a type 2 diabetic and the pills were just not working.  I take 20 mg of the lantus pen and I have been in the very low 100's and it is working!  I still take the pill in the morning but the lantus insulin has been working for me, along with diet and exercise what a relief and the BD needles you cannot feel at all.. its nothing I was afraid to do it but when I did it nothing was felt, I haven't had any issues with the lantus pen or any of their products!  ",5,5,4
"I'M HAVING VERY SEVERE SKIN PROBLEMS SUCH AS SKIN PEELING OFF, OPEN BLEEDING SORES ON SCALP AND EARS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF LIQUID IN EARS. EXTREMELY PAINFUL TO A POINT THAT I CAN'T LIE DOWN ON MY EARS TO SLEEP.",2,3,5
"I had severe side effects I associated with this medication, Lantus Solostar. I had nerve pain, my blood vessels ""swelled"" and foot turned sort of purple in some places. Lots of pain and swelling in lower legs, could barely drive at times. I took it for somewhere between six months and a year. THings to note: Lantus (and most ""insulin"") is not REALLY insulin, it is bio-engineered and I wonder if that makes a difference. It is also preserved with a poison (M-cresol). But Victoza is also preserved with a poison (phenol, which was used specifically to kill people by the Nazis) but the Victoza seems to ""agree"" with me a lot more than Lantus so far. I don't know if these poisons (for example caustic PH levels) can be neutralized in the medications for sure. Or if we can neutralize ALL the negatives of a poison, as opposed to just some.  I think we need to re-think our medications and the way we deliver them. For example, why not use preservative-free pens that can be unrefrigerated for a few days, as opposed to weeks. I'd trade some convenience for safety. What about insulins that are not just ""like"" the natural thing, but actually are that thing? Bydureon (not insulin)does not seem to have a preservative and is used once per week, but may be hard to use for some, with mixing and longer needle. I notice people on this site have tended to not be long-term users and I wonder if that has something to do with all the positive reviews. When I was considering not using Lantus anymore, I saw another site where the reviews were much more like mine, they were very negative. Hmmm. That is what helped to convince me to go off Lantus even though my doctor kept urging me to keep giving it chances, and BOY am I glad I did stop it. Also note, it did NOT control my blood sugar, and I didn't think  increasing the dose time after time after time would make it work and I think I was right. I use Victoza, Metformin and Invokana now. Just added Invokana. This seems to be a good combo for me.",2,1,1
"I itch all the time. Mostly on the trunk of my body; stomach, chest, neck",5,5,5
I have been using this at first in the morning when I got up. I was in the hospital in Dec. of13 and there they gave this to me a night before going to sleep. I came home and had visiting Nurses and 1 told me to eat protein before I went to bed either Peanut Butter or Cottage Cheese and this will help keep your numbers under control. It works. I also take 2 Glimepride 4MG and 4 Motron 500 MG. I hope this helps ome body else.,5,5,5
"Lantus, of course, is very effective but until now I have used syringes but switched to pens. The Lantus pen frequently locks up and cannot be injected no matter how hard you push. I have found this in about 1 of every 6-7 pens. The manufacturer provides NO support, you cannot even e-mail them and of course there is no telephone number. I did write a letter of complaint but they have no interest in their customers. ",2,2,5
"I have taken for over a year.  Stomach is fatter and fatter each month as I lose weight overall.  Am not obese.. twenty pounds over ideal weight for my age.  Lantus solo just builds fat cells wherever it is injected.  Wonder if ok to use to fill wrinkles??  Kidding, but think all diabetes medicines are poison and none will help overall health.  Only exercise and diet will help.  Where are all the diabetes boot camps??  Think everyone diagnosed with type 2 should attend a three week boot camp to learn how to eat and exercise properly before any diabetes meds are prescribed.  Once you start taking the meds, you will have all kinds of other issues with health...  from losing essential nutrients to downright deficiencies that cannot be overcome until you stop taking the meds.  Know your doctor deems the risk smaller than the benefit, but so do the drug companies giving doctors incentive to prescribe their brand of poison.",2,1,4
"Just diagnosed, actually today.  My hemoglobin a1c was extremely high and blood glucose 300.  I was given Lantus and metformin.  I hate taking medication and am deathly afraid.  Maybe I just need to wrap my head around all of this.  Any suggestions?",1,1,1
"I've had T2 for 13 years now. Went on Byetta for 9 months. Initially,it worked great but the positive effects wore off leaving me with the common side effect of feeling bloated. I was taking 20 mg of Glipizide along with 2500 mg of Metformin. Glipizide has been eliminated,but Metformin is still being taken. I actually split my doses. 10 mg Lantus at night and 8mg in the morning. Morning readings are consistently under 130 in the morning,bedtime 120 and under. Easy to spike though as we know. Zero lows thus far. I've been on it for three weeks now. Only getting up once in the night to urinate. happy camper so far. Hopefully,Obamacare won't take this wonderfull drug from me in 2014.",4,5,4
"I have been on Lantus 30 units for three years.  Recently my provider switched me over to the Solostar.  I am finding thst it doesn't control my diabetes.  I amout of swtaste which makes it more difficult to communicate with my physician.  Is it normal for a patient to have a break in period,  or should my resultsbe better.I had been running in the low 100's, but now find my readings to be creeping up.  What should I do?",4,2,2
"This is my fourth day of taking Lantus.  My blood sugars seem to be coming down although I won't be surprised if an increase in Lantus will be necessary.  When I inject it, I seem to get little stomach pains and last night I woke up with terrible loose bowels.  Has anyone had this experience due to the Lantus??",5,4,4
"Was borderline diabetic until new doctor 5 years ago said ""no such thing."" Been on Actos twice a day with pretty good results. Was switched to insulin 5 weeks ago at 20 units. Told to increase by 3 units every 3 days if sugar didn't go down to 125. I usually run 165 to 195. After weeks was up to 47 units when I had an adverse reaction of feeling like body on fire within 2 minutes of the injection, BP went to 170/90. PC to doctor next day she didn't think it was the injection, I strongly disagreed. She prescribed Levemir Flexpen as a replacement. Note: didn't take any insuling last PM - sugar was 170 - lower than when I was on the insulin? Insulin made me sweaty for about an hour ever since I have been taking it.    ",5,1,1
"This medication has been easy for me to use, very satisfied.",5,5,5
"When these pens first came out they were well made with a mechancially smooth injection. However for well over a year now the pens stick and jam when injecting and usually require hard pressing with a thumb to inject. The result is bleeding, bruising and discomfort. ",1,1,4
I hated the thought of using a needle but found the pen easy to use. My only problem was injecting into my legs which caused pain and cramps so I now just use my stomach. It seems to work fine but would work better if I stopped eating donuts...,4,4,4
"I have been type 2 for 5 years .The 1st year was pills of all kinds and they did nothing,the 2nd was novalog before each meal,still not good then cime novalog 70/30 better butnot great then my sugar went completely out of control for a year and a half its been 6 month since i started lantius. right now im taking 60 units twice a day and its coming down, i've gone from being in the 500's to 170's. its a slow going but it is working",5,5,5
I gave it only 2 stars on question 2 because I have just started on the med and have yet to get the right dose. I will see my Doc in two days and I am sure we will adjust the dosage up by 10 units. I have hated needles my whole life and was afraid 15 years ago when I found out I was diabetic that I would start out with injections. I did well for the first 14 plus years until I retired . My number went from A1C of 5.0 to 8.5. I was not happy at first but after using the Lantus solostar pen to inject my fears where overcome and now do it easily. I know when the right dose is found I will be better then ever . ,5,5,2
BS was running over 300 but after one week on Lantus (14 units) I am down to 120 in the morning. Hope it stays this way. Hate sticking myself and wish it were cheaper but what can you do...,3,4,5
Easy to use. 40 units a day with 2 Actoplus Met pills keeps me under 110 readings. But I've had a severe itchy rash on my left leg for months and have had several cortisone shots for it and nothing helps. Stopped taking the injections for about a week and even tho my blood sugar levels went back up the rash went away. Started the injections back...rash came back. Hate to change insulin but I can't take this rash anymore!,5,3,5
The best treatment for type 1 diabetes short of stem cell research. ,5,4,5
I have had problems with the consistency of vial strength when starting new bottle. It appears as shown in my blood glucose levels that I have received new vials that don't seem to have original potency. I discovered this two times and after starting a new bottle my numbers have gone back done. I had to throw away the new bad vial which is costly. I'd monitor immediately everytime you start a new vial.  ,2,3,4
"I have long been on Lantus via the Opticlik. The drug itself works well. Unfortunately Sanofi Aventis put profits before their patients with the SoloStar. It's absolute and completely junk. It jams, is extremely difficult to depress, and it's next to impossible to get the correct dosage out of if you dosage is a sizable one.",1,1,5
Diabetic for 8 years and was afraid of insulin.  Resent hospital stay and advised by doctor to start Lantus.  Wish I had started a long time ago.   BG numbers are down and energy level is UP.  Follow up in Novemeber hope to get good results on A1C. Use of pen is also easy and painless.  Don't be afraid to try this medication.,5,5,5

i have been taking lantus insulin injections for eight years now and i am starting to experience stiffiness and pain in my feet and lower legs,5,1,5
diagnosed the week before Christmas!ughh! but at my first 3 month check A1C dropped from 10.7 to 6.5 taking metformin 2x daily and Lantus 69 (clicks) 1x right before bed. Also seriously counting carbs and exercising have also lost #40... I feel as though I'm headed in the right direction :)),5,5,5
I TRIED PILLS FOR MANY YEARS WITH VARING RESULTS.THE LANTUS TREATMENT HAS BEEN CONSISTANT.,5,5,5
"Lantus has effectively reduced my A1C levels and helps maintain blood sugar levels below 110.  Unfortunately, Maryland Health Insurance Plan will not cover cost for this drug.  the cost is prohibitively expensive, I just can't affort it.",4,4,4

"Had to stop taking this drug after 2 weeks. The first side effect was flu-like symptoms and being very tired at 10 units. Called the doctor, who told me to keep taking it, as it couldn't be the insulin causing the symptoms. Kept taking it, with instructions to increase dosage to 15 units after 1 week. After 3 doses at 15 units, I woke up with my eyes swollen shut! Stopped the drug, called the clinic, they had me see a doc, who told me to stop taking it and to see another doc. Tried the lantus again, swollen eye lids and took a benadryl. Also had rash on face. In 2 weeks of taking lantus, my blood sugars stayed the same. Reported side effects to the FDA.",4,1,1
The pens do NOT work well at all.  They tend to start squirting medicine all over the place instead of in a nice stream as it should.  No satisfaction from questions and complaints about it.  Three out of the 5 pen pack malfunctioned.  My daughter is a nurse and she is injecting me correctly.,1,1,3
I cannot find the data I need on this product.  It would seem to me if I knew the attack & decay rate I would be able to adjust the dose appropriately.  Can anybody help please?,5,1,5
I am feeling lots of joint pain. I stopped taking the Lantus for about 1 week . because i had viral type symptoms. when i began it again the joint pains resumed with a vengence.,5,2,4
Before starting lantus my blood sugar was always high and nothing seemed to work. Now that I take lantus it keeps my numbers normal through out the day. Its been amazing how well lantus works. I can't stress enough how lantus turned my numbers arround. I'm reading like a normal blood sugar now all through the day. It only takes one shot a day and that lasts twenty four hours. The solostar pen is so easy to use and completely painless. I recomend lantus its been a wonder drug for me and I've had no side effects. Its a quality product and I definetly recomend it. I was giving up hope on my blood sugar before lantus because nothing else I tried was working.now after lantus I can count on perfect blood sugar every time.lantus is the way to go. Its quick easy and painless you can't beat it. Its been a miricle treatment for me.,5,5,5
Reducing the needle depth and thickness may be more convinient and less pain full.,3,3,4
I am a diabetic type 1 i used insulin for 11 year but just stared with lantus 5 years ago i would recommend lantus to anyone it gives you great control o your blood suger   ,5,5,5
I really like Lantus. I was switch to it along with Novolog from Glipizide because my husband and I are trying to conceive.   It started working and bringing my numbers down within a day or two and it consistently keeps them down. My latest A1C was 5.9%.   I take 10 units per day. I like insulin so much that I am considering switching to it for good even when we are not trying to get pregnant. Its nice to not have to take a ton of pills each day. ,5,5,5
ITS NOT GOIN A THING ,5,1,1
My A1c is running between 5.8 and 6.2 for the last two years.,5,5,5
doctors say I am a type 1.5 diabetic. Something in jene pool. Have always been little. Been taking 20 units of lantus for 5 years at bedtime and have great results. No side effects at all.,5,5,5
Have been on Lantus for over a year at 80+ units nightly.  Had too many side effects from every pill.  No side effects on lantus. Still have trouble with control of high sugars sometimes.  Over all I feel the best since started taking Lantus.  ,5,3,4
i have been on this medication or almost 2 weeks.  so far no problems except i feel cold a lot. have been taking metformin and glipizide for some time now and have adjusted the metformin to 500 mg in the a.m. and 1000 mg at bedtime along with my injection.,4,3,4
"I have been on lantus for about a week, with excellent results. For the first time in 20 years i feel I will be able to control my sugars!!",5,5,5
it has helped me very much when oral pills stoped working as they should. fear to start but it is so easy to do. more strenth and more active. great drug,4,4,4
I have been using Lantus for 1 and 1/2 months. I still take metforman and glimperide daily. It appears to have improved and stabilized my blood sugar. I do still have some issues with getting a good nights rest but I'm not certain it is due to the Lantus. I hope to be able to get off the pills all together. So far so good and I do have more energy now than before.I do not any negitive things to say at this time and hope it remains that way.  ,5,5,5
"My wife complains of a serious bad breath coming from me she says its a horrible chemical smell worse than mothballs and she avoids getting close to me.

lantus has been a successful medication. the only downfall i have is it causes weight gain.,5,4,4
I HAVE BEEN ON LANTIS ABOUT A MONTH AND MY COUNTS ARE STILL HIGH AND OUT OF CONTROLL,5,3,2
"I have been on Lantus Solostar for 3 months and it immediately started working for me.  I had no Idea I was diabetic, as I went to the MD for unexplained weight loss (down to 95 pounds) and found that my bs was averaging at around 460.  I have it controlled to around 70 to 118.  I take it at night (8 units) and sometimes I wake up with extreme low bs (as low as 45), overall It has really worked for me.",5,5,5
"My blood sugar still 150-250 at 50 units at bedtime. I have stomach cramps, gas and a slight diarrhea all the time. Very dissatisfied with the medication results.",3,1,2
"I was diagnosed in 2000 and my doctors tried every oral pill and combination to control my levels.  I been taking Lantus for 1 year now up to 50 ml with morning injections.  My levels still over 250 even after loosing 40 lbs.  Still experiencing light headedness at 250, can't inject at night due to crazy dream state that keeps me awake so I inject in the morning.  Doctors are baffled with my results and I'm frustrated after all these years with no good results.  Now I have no health insurance and search for new doctor. Thanks to Sanofi for patient asstance.  My two concerns with this medication is while I take 50 with no better results then when I was taking Glucotrol LX 30 X 2 and the crazy disturbing sleep pattern when I inject at night.  I may need to try something else.  any suggestions [email protected]",4,1,1
when i started this med my bs was running between 300 to 500. within 3 weeks i run about 111 at 41 units. easy med and convenant.,5,4,5

I start taking Lantus 1 month ago started out with 10 mg Lantus once a day & 5 mg Glipizide & 850 mg of Metformin twice a day. I did not see a difference in my blood sugars - found that if I don't eat or as much and am really carefull what I eat levels stay lower - eat anythng sweet and they are high- since starting I have not seen my levels under 150 - decide to go to specialist and get second opinion. Also notice since being on this I am weaker and by whole body aches - at times my legs hurt and keep me up at night will be discussing all of this with the specialist. Not sure any of this works - going to work harder and reducing my weight so hopefully will not need to take any more. Will up date after seeing specialist. thank you for listening. ,5,1,3
problem I have tremendious stomach cramps and a lot of gas. starts almost emediately after taking injection 20 ml at a time,4,4,2
I have been taking Lantus since 5/09 and I am very happy with the results.  It took a few weeks to get the results I was looking for.  It is nice to only inject once a day.  I do not take any pills since starting on Lantus.,5,4,4
"my blood suger go down in morning, after break fast goes high and stay high evev i am taking pill.",5,1,2
"I have been on Lantus alittle over a month now & they have me up to 80 (trying to stabilize amt needed)& I have experienced lightheadiness, tightness in chest & throat,some pains in stomach after the shot,dizziness at times and some itching..all of this comes & goes but I have noticed it starts to occur 15 to 30 minutes after the shot..when it was lower dosage I didn't notice this happening..I am  on lisinopril-hctz 20-12.5 also for high blood pressure...Has anyone else had these problems? help!!!!!!!

"I NOW FEEL IN CONTROL,AND CAN FACE EACH DAY.",5,4,5
I am taking 30 units at night and 8 units of nonolog flex pen before every meal and the two together have been great for me.,5,5,5
"I was diagnosed with DMII about 3 yrys ago. When on insilun about 1yr ago. First had the lantus with the big needles, hardly took it becasue I hated the needles and getting it all set up. My sugars were running in high 300's sometimes as high as 500! Since I have started this pen, I have found it sooo easy to use. Just turn it to the correct number and put the needle on-which is waaaay smaller. My average A1C use to be 10.3 but since I've started this, my last A1C test - last month- was 6.8!!! I feel better and am so happy with the results. Glad the dietition suggested it to me.",5,5,5
I HAVE HAD A LOT OF BODY PAIN BOTH JOINT AND MUSCLE IS THIS A SIDE AFECT OF LANTUS,5,5,3
"This is my fourth day of use.  I froze all night, and have nausea, bad this morning. Any one else have this.?",5,3,3
Began my first injection of Lantus last night. Was nervous - but found it very very easy to use - not painful at all - and no side effects yet - had a BS of 142 this morning - but sadly had a BS of 300 two hours after breakfast. Have high hopes it will work - but not quite convinced with that 300 number. Keeping my finger crossed. Pray for me that it will work and I'll be doing the same for you! Will post progress update in a week or two.   ,5,3,3
"I have had Diabetes for 32 years.  The last 6 years I have been taking Lantus along with Novolog.  I inject approximately 26 units every evening before bed time.  For some reason, not all the time, I get real low after taking the Lantus.  This happened recently, where I was at 174, did not eat a snack, went down to 29.  Had to have the EMT's here to revive me from an insulin reaction.",4,1,2
"Today will be the first day of using this new medicine and I am very leary. It makes me very uneasy trying new meds, I know we are not supposed to go by advice of posts on WebMD by other users but because of some of the positive posts of how it works for others am I going to try it after holding it for about 2weeks before use, especially because I can see others are using this along with other diabetic pills and other insulin pens, which I thought my doctor was crazy saying that I could take all together. I will post again in about 1week or 2 of what I really think. I'm really hoping this pen works as my sugar is wayyyy out of control. Doctor said all I have to take with this one is once daily. Wish me Luck!",5,3,3
Works great,5,5,5
"After almost 3 weeks of using, I started to develop rashes and itcheness all over my body.Besides being diabetic, I am hypertensive and recently underwent angioplasty procedures. My medicines are Tenormin50 mg, Adalat 100/25 mg,Hyzar100 mg, Imdur 60 mg, Niacin 500mg, Flavix 75, Aspirin 325 mg,Lyphantyl  160 mg,Simbastatin 40 mg. Glicazide ( Diamicron MR) 30 mg -(3 tabs), Januvia 50 mg. Is there any complication between my present medications and Lanusa Solo Star ? I am injecting 15mg lanusa at bed time.",3,3,3
"Diabetic for 26+ years. Have tried pills, Different kinds of Insulin, Lantus since April/08. Best control ever. Less hypo/hyper symptoms. Very few reactions. ",4,4,4
Have been taking 35units every evening for three months. Every once in awhile some itching at injection site. No weakness. Some burning at the injection sie while administering. Taking with Metformin and Januvia. Blood glucose levels okay but still tending to fluctuate 80 to 100 in the morning.,3,4,4
"I have been on Lantus and Humalog since my diagnosis, one year ago.  My a1c went from 14.5 at diagnosis to 6.4 after three months.  I fluctuate my dose between 6-9 units depending on where I am with my menstrual cycle.  2 consecutive high (110+) readings in the morning means time to increase; 2 consecutive low (-80) morning readings, time to decrease.  I inject at 930p, have a snack, and test bg an hour later.  My only complaint is that sometimes, if I'm under 110ish when I inject, I'll need to eat two bedtime snacks -- one when I inject, and one after the Lantus has kicked in (to sustain me through the night).  Overall, I couldn't be happier.",5,5,5
Since I have been diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes I have been using Lantus and Humalog They both work very well and the insuln pens are very easy to use. Just a couple turns of the knob and you have the exact amoutn of insulin. It works great!,5,5,5
I have only been on it for 1 week.  So far it is lowering my sugar slowly with oral meds also.  With time I think it will work.,5,4,3
this medication is good for me since am allergic to alot of the pills my endocrinoligst has given me. but right now I cannot afford it. my healthcare does not covered much of it and its reallly expensive for me to have. disappointed.:(,5,5,5
"I am having a problem with weakness,  Was told by a nurse that this could be do to thyrod. I believe it is Lantus.  I have been on Lantus for about two months. Who else has this problem?",4,3,4
"I have been a diabetic for almost twenty years and was very opposed to taking insulin, but I am pleasantly surprised at how easy Lantus is and how well I feel - lots of energy and good blood sugar results.  I'm glad I finally listened to the advice of my doctor.",5,5,5
"I would like to know if anyone has had a problem with Lantus. I have been on it for over two yrs, but I seem to be losing strength over my intire body. This has been taking place the past several months. I had a sister that was on Lantus and the same thing happen to her.She has past away with in the past month. No one has said that anything was wrong with Lantus and if it has a side effect of any kind, does anyone know anything about this, are haveing the same systoms. ",4,4,4
it has controled my sugar great and i do not have to take 4 to5 other pills a day.no side effects it's great and has less side effects to organs that the pills damage,5,5,5
"Works extremely well for me, but only if I include exercise as part of the program. I am also taking Metformin and they work really well together. No adverse reactions at all",4,4,4
It gave me non-stop diarrhea and severe stomach cramps.  Dr lowered dose and the symptoms still persisted aggressively.  Felt like I had severe flu all the time.  I quit taking it and Dr put me on something else that works much better. ,2,1,2
"I have IBS and Metformin aggravated my symptoms to the point that I had to take an anti-dirreha medication which caused constipation and aggravated my hemorrhoids. I never could get a good balance between the two and I finally stopped taking the Metformin. I have gained all my weight back and my doctor wants to put me back on Metformin, but I just can't live like that.",1,1,3
Seems to control blood sugar erratically,5,3,3
"Non insulin drug has significantly reduced my blood sugar levels (and my weight) after years of uncontrolled blood sugars using insulin and glucaphage. Only thing, keep hydrated and stomach motility intact with natural foods and supplements. Works for me.",5,4,5

"I started taking in November 2016 and by January I started having pain in my abdominal area, the pain was on my skin like a sunburn-sensitive to touch in all 4 quadrants. a belt was very irritating even a tee shirt was bugging me. I was on separate pills for 8 years and never had any symptoms like this. Doctors, CT scans, could not find the problem even endoscopy showed no signs. So I stopped the metaglip and went back to normal pills Metformin 500mg glipizide 10 mg. now the sensitivity is diminishing and nausea stopped as well another problem that was scary. I hope I didn't damage my organs. The good new is they found a tumor on my kidnry from the scans, getting that frozen",5,1,1
I've been taking this for over 6 years and it has kept my BS levels near 100 and my A1C in the mid 5's,5,5,5
i have had no unusual side effects with this medicine compared to avandia that scared me away taking that drug,4,4,4
I had some loose bowels since I've been taking this medication. Nothing that I can't control.,5,5,4
This medication caused my blood sugar to drop so low that I ended up in the ER not knowing who I was or what I was doing. I hated it. ,5,1,2
I am taking for PCOS. No side effects yet. Have actually lost 2 pounds my first week. Taking 500mgx2. Hope this continues. ,5,5,4
"I took 1 dose, and my entire GI system suffered. I started with stomach cramps, which led to extremely watery bowels as well as painful bowels and nausea. That night my stomach was so distended I couldn't sleep and every time I turned over I could feel the gases shift. Pain was a 10 out of 10. It took 4 days to get my body back to normal.",4,1,3
"Well besides the constant diarrhea, everything else is good.",5,4,5
I started taking this twice a day.  500 mg twice a day.  Before I started taking it my a1c was 7.3.  After 3 or 4 months my a1c is now 6.2. I had no bad side effects at first. My bowel movements were hard but thats about it.  It has now been 3 or 4 months and I am sick to my stomach.  I have explosive diarrhea now and cannot leave the bathroom.  I have to work for a living so I had to quit taking it.  My stomach grumbles so loudly it sounds like there is a war going on inside my stomach! I dont know how long it takes til its out of my system but OMG I am still having some symptoms.  Not sure why after 3 or 4 months I would start having bad side effects.  I use my test strips to test multiple times a day and my blood sugars are still good so I think the metformin is still in my system.  I will have to contact my doc to let her know I quit taking it and need something else.  Hopefully there is something else she can give me.,5,1,5
Blood glucose ranging from 170-300 both AM and PM. A1C consistently at ~7.0. Now on Metformin 1000mgX2 for 2 weeks. One day of diarrhea. No response yet but hoping for drops in number. Allergic to all forms of exercise so relying on diet and medicine.   ,3,4,3
"Taking 500 mg per day.  Some stomach discomfort right away and brief diarrhea.  In the 3rd week the full drug kicked in.  Due to the severe weakness, muscle cramping, sleeplessness, tiredness, chest pain and discomfort, flu like symptoms and shortness of breath I have had to stop the medication.  I am so sick I fear this med may kill me.  I am stopping and trying to treat more aggressively with diet and exercise.  This drug is not for me. ",3,1,2
I am thankful that Metformin has kept me from having Type 2 Diabetes however the reviews of how harmful this medication is scares me. I am 63 years old and have taken this medication for at least 10 years now I am not exactly sure when I started it!,4,3,4
"On 1000mg 2 x a day.  Does ok during the day but my Dr says my liver ""drips"" glucose overnight and it does not keep my numbers down where it should be in the mornings.    Also have a real problem with diarrhea from this medicine.  ",3,2,3
Started out fine taking one tablet. I had flu like symptoms but did not connect the two. My doctor increased dosage to a secondtablet. Flu like symptoms worsened including severe congestion. I am not able to take this medication due to constantlybeing sick but I did get good results from it.,1,1,5
"I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 1.5 months ago.  My A1C was 15.8, Urine Glucose over 500 (test max) and my first home blood glucose test was 577.

My Blood Glucose has been in the 85-150 range the past month.  I have modified my diet some.  I did experience some diarrhea, though am over it now.",5,5,5

No noticeable effects,5,5,4

Diagnosed with diabetes 3 years ago placed on metformin twice/day 1000mg/ 6 monthsago my a1c was dropping significantly. Last a1c was 4.3 decreased my dose to 500mg daily. Dr so pleased and wants to repeat a1c in 3 months if remains low stop medication altogether! YEAH!,5,5,5

LATELY MY SUGAR READING HAVE BEEN HIGHER THAN USUAL. THIS IS A NEW PRESCRIPTION AND I AM WONDERING IF THE PILLS COULD BE OLD COMING FROM THE PHARMACIST.,5,3,5
I started on this about a year ago and my side effects were so bad I had to stop taking them. I had severe diarrhea and I had what was almost like morning sickness. The smell of most foods made me sick and the taste of foods that I loved changed. I could hardly even eat for 2 weeks so I stopped taking them. My doctor started me back on them about a month ago on a lower dose to see how I did with them. About 2 weeks in I started back with the diarrhea and severe stomach pain. Thankfully the smells and tastes of foods hasn't changed this time. I'm trying to do my best to just deal with the stomach issues but it's really hard.  ,3,3,3
"I used to gag on my metformin pills they smelled so bad. But I found a brand, Zydus Pharmaceuticals, which doesn't smell and have not had a problem since. I had to have CVS special order them.  Make sure it's marked with a z on one side and the number 70 on the reverse.",4,4,4

"The stomach pain and diarrhea is horrible!!!  Been on it less than a week.  The first two days were fine but on the third day diarrhea set in.  This was followed by excruciating stomach pains that left me bedridden.  Pains so bad, I could not get stand or sit straight",1,1,4
"After being put on 2 pills of 750 mg at night, I became ill after a few weeks with a ""mysterious"" illness that no one could figure out.  Uncontrollable high blood pressure which sent me to the ER -190/107 which is not good for a brain aneurysm survivor.  Headaches, nausea, severe leg cramping, bladder failure and then finally stomach aches. I kept being sent for more tests and specialists.  I finally read the reviews here and decided to stop this med cold turkey.  I slowly got better and now 2 1/2 weeks later all the symptoms are gone.  My GP (who did not prescribe this) has just listed this in my official record that I am allergic to it.  Awful stuff - I have never been so scared about what was wrong with me.  I am now under the care of a nephrologist to make sure my blood pressure is controlled - I now have stage 3 kidney disease.",1,1,1

"I was diagnosed with PCOS 7 years ago. I was over 200lbs when diagnosed. Started metformin and w/in 3 months was down to 150. Stayed on the meds for about a year and was taking 1500mg a day.  I took the meds at night so as to sleep through any of the major side effects. Stomach cramping, bathroom issues those were the only main things.  I went off of the meds and slowly over the last 4 years have gained all of my weight back.  Started the meds again and like before take them at night, sleep through the side effects, but this time i now feel so queezy in the mornings. Its almost like morning sickness queezy (no chance in that as i had a full hysterectomy when 3 months after i was diagnosed with PCOS).  The weight loss this go round has not happened, in 6 months i have lost maybe 2lbs. But DR just started me on Spiro along with the metformin so hopefully the weightloss kicks in soon. ",4,5,5
"I have been sick for the past 3 weeks and I am coming to the conclusion that it is this medication.  I have headaches, nausea, stomach pains, bloating and gas.  I actually lost my bladder function for 3 days before it came back - this after having to go to the ER with uncontrollable high blood pressure.  I have severe leg cramps at night.  And, my doctor has been testing me for all sorts of things.  I am stopping this med this week to see if that is what is happening - my doctor was thinking of sending me to an infectious disease doctor!!",2,1,2
"Metformin 500 mg 2 tablets twice daily.  I like these pills, no side effects which I consider myself lucky.  Every since I was put on Metformin my levels have gotten lower and my doctor is reducing the amount of Levemir and Novolog I take daily.",5,5,5

"I take 500mg twice daily for about 3 months. I have only read some of the reviews but my side effects are constipation and everything taste the same kind of  bland or dull. The taste thing started about two weeks ago the constipation from week one. Other than that no problems. The constipation I can deal with but the taste thing that really bothers me. I have read were people have lost weight while taking it and I have to, but if everything taste the same eating becomes less desirable I can see why you would lose weight.",4,3,4
"1/2 of a 500mg works, but 500mg whole tablet causes increase to Blood glucose (Bg).  1/2 tab for 4 days Bg dropped from 340 to 285, then took a whole tablet for 2 days and Bg was 485.  Once I returned to 1/2 tablet, Bg dropped to 285.",4,1,3
"Mere days after starting Metformin 1000 mg (2 x 500mg oval tablets), I woke up with blurry vision. Blurry vision is constant now. From the beginning, I've had loose stools (gotten much better) and flatulence. The pills made me feel nauseous. I've also had a few bouts of feeling over-heated. Since the day I started Metformin, I've had low grade temple headaches. I'm in a Diabetic program at Veterans Admin.

I discovered I had Type 2 diabetes on an annual physical. My A1c blood level was 10.1. I realized then there was a serious problem. Metformin assisted with reducing my sugar levels from 230 to normal 100. I changed my diet to eating only greens and meats. Zero carbs and zero sugars. ,5,5,5
"Let's put it this way severe stomach pain taking this medication as soon as I stopped taking the med, the pain stopped. this med put me is a severe panic attack because of the pain that I ended up going to the ER. I was taking the max dose per day 3 850 pills a day. ",5,1,1
"I lost 20 pounds in just a few months on this medication. I didn't like the smell, so I held my breath when taking it. And, I took it with dinner which I think helped with some of the side effects others experienced. I think it is effective. The pills are very cheap.",5,5,5

"My PCOS was really making me ravenously hungry, my weight was getting harder to manage, and I also felt moody. Since starting metformin, I've lost 15 lbs (I am post-partum, so maybe it would've come off anyway?), my appetite is normal, and my moods are dramatically improved. I was hoping it would help with hair growth--I haven't noticed any change. Try the extended release so you don't feel sick to your stomach. And ease into the full dose--I think I took over a month to increase up to the full amount and I've only felt sick when I haven't eaten enough. I can't comment on fertility/periods since I am still breastfeeding and only a few months post-partum.",4,4,4
My doctor told me I was pre-diabectic. My a1c was 5.8. I had been having problems with gaining excess weight so she put me on metformin she said I may lose weight now but instead I didn't.  It actually kept me from gaining more weight but no weight loss. I was taking 750 once a day and all of a sudden I notice my hair started falling out. I stopped the medication even though hair loss is not one of the side effects. Has anyone else had this problem?,2,2,2
"I started taking Metformin 1000 about 2 months ago or so,  and I've had terrible nausea, vomiting episodes (which never happens, I hadn't vomited since I was a child, I'm 32 now, so I hated having these vomiting episodes, uncontrollable vomit)with cold sweats and cold hands/feet, but honestly I think the benefits are worth the upset tummy :-) I think my body will adjust soon, I hear it does get better, and I just realized I need to watch what I eat, I read reviews that said if you eat a lot of fat it will cause explosive diarrhea, so I won't do that anymore, (I used to eat compulsively from anxiety/depression) but this medicine along with an antidepressant medication has considerably lowered my appetite, I now eat for nutrition, I eat for survival and NOT to comfort myself. So since my appetite is so low lately I'll make sure and choose healthier food options, which will also help me lose weight. (Ive lost 17lbs but that was before I started Metformin I just lowered my servings size by 70%)I weigh 154 now, I don't have diabetes only PCOS, so cutting down food intake dind't mess with my blood sugar at all, so hopefully I'll lose another few lbs so to get back to my normal weight. (I went from 125 to 171, crazy! now I'm 154) I'm satisfied with the med, I just need to stop eating stuff that will make me vomit/diarrhea, no more fatty or sugary foods until my body gets used to the drug and then I'll have it with moderation. I also think it helps with hirutism.",4,4,4
"My doctor prescribed 1000 mg a day in the form of two 500 mg pills a day after I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic. Since taking the medication, my A1C has dropped to 5.4 at last check, so I believe a combination of the medication and lifestyle changes have helped. Unfortunately, ever since I have started the medication, I suffer from very frequent diarrhea, fecal urgency or outright incontinence (a few times). It was worse in the beginning, but it does make it difficult to take the medication as prescribed at times.",5,3,5
I take 2 tablets of 1000mg everyday and I have had no side effects whatsoever!,5,5,5
I have been on Metformin for the last four years and have not encounter any side efects. I keep my blood sugar in check with an A1C of 6.2 to 6.4. Of course a healthy diet and walking daily has complemented these results.,5,5,5
"My doctor put me on it after he diagnosed me as pre-diabetic at my last physical.  I've been on 500mg, once a day for about a month now.  Having not been retested yet, I don't know if it's been effective.  I take it with breakfast and haven't experienced any side affects until the last few days.  I experienced bad diarrhea a couple of days ago.  It only lasted one day so thinking it was some sort of bug, I stopped taking it for a couple of days.  I felt fine yesterday, so I decided to start back on it today, now I feel light headed, and my stomach is cramping.  Not sure if it's still the ""bug"" or the drug.  I'll just have to wait and see. ",3,3,3
"Was on two tablets per day (500mg each) - after eating had to excuse myself - every time I ate, I had to go to the bathroom - nutrients from food had left my body (obviously).  I started taking only one tablet per day - no more cramping or bathroom problems.  Have been taking it for about 9 months - A1C was lowered but then back up again.  Does anyone know if this medication causes high cholesterol readings?  You would think that by avoiding sugars and starches (carbs)on a regular basis (not always but most times) that my cholesterol would be lowered? Is something else causing the high cholesterol, or can it be a side effect of this drug?",2,2,2
"you may wonder why I rated this drug so hi,i have been type 2 for 5 months, not treating,also at the same time I was getting prednisone shoots in my foot,and for colds.well rare but it can raise your a1c mine hit 411/402 my a1c was very hi also.so the doc stared me on 1000 a day metformin to 1500 a day now what a blessing.i seen a sugar doctor she added linagliptin 5mg once at night its been 2 going for 3 weeks treating and my levels our 110/118 morning test after lunch 45 minutes 118 just before dinner 88 this is testing many times a day.i,m going to test one more time rt after dinner.i got 116 I,m very greatfull treatment has worked so well for me.",5,5,5

Ten years use. No problems. Recently reduced because of effectiveness.,5,5,5
"I just started taking 500mg once a day, biggest issue for me is the fatigue only slight nausea, no diarrea I take it at night with dinner, and last night after about half hour, what I experienced is this feeling of intense weakness rushing through my body, doesn't last long, but I definitely feel it,. In the early part of the day when I wake up, I seem to feel more clear headed, less fuzzy, eyes more clear, no blurring, feel more normal.  it's too soon to say whether my A1C has gone down yet or not.  It was 6.2 and a recent bs was 143 after eating a couple cookies. Was really starting to feel bad the last month so I requested it. ",3,3,3
"I was on metformin for 10 years, the side effects were nausea, vomiting, increase gas pain, diarrhea, sleepiness and majorly increased blood flow each month through my periods, soaking 3-4 pads within an hour. I lost 8.5 pounds during that time frame even with diet and minimal exercise... It wasn't until I took myself. I don't recommend use of this drug. Just eat right and exercise and you'll feel better. ",1,1,1
"No stomach problems because I eat before taking it. My A1C lower thanks to this medicine. I don't like to take any medicines but I need it if for a while I stopped making exercises. You need to make exercises when you have Diabetes 2. You need to eat wise, not a lot of sugar 6g read the labels. The juices contain a lot of sugar, like 29g or more. No diet sodas, aspartame will poison your body. Take care and good luck!!! ",5,5,5
"I will NEVER take this medication ever again. I started this pill two days ago for my pcos. My doc told me to start with just half a pill. Day one, felt fine. Day two I was nauseous, dizzy, dry mouthed, anxious, emotional, foggy brained and had no energy. That was just from half a pill and my doc wants me to work my way up to 3 pills a day. Not happening! And what I found odd is she straight up asked me if I was taking this med for my pcos. I said no I had never heard of it and she said well you should be on it. Why I found this odd is that she and I had a conversation about my pcos 6 mo ago and she never once mentioned this med now all of a sudden, I should be on it. Prescription drug pushing is what I believe happened here. This med is awful. I get there is an adjustment period to a new med in my system but it's not worth it. I would rather put up with my chin hair than all the symptoms I went through today.",1,1,1

"Metformin nearly killed me.  Terrible diarrhea (with blood), severe nausea, confusion, ""fog-brain"", dizziness.  The first couple of episodes, I thought I had food poisoning.  Then on third trip to ER, realized it was the Metformin.  New doctor putting me on Prandin.  Was told it works in a different way and less reported side effects.  We'll see.  ",3,1,3

"I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in mid July 2015. Since then, I have taken Metformin 500 mg X 2/day. At first, I experienced some problems with ""have to go"" moments and some diarrhea, but not excessive to the point that I thought about discontinuing it. I have yet to go to my first check-up since being diagnosed but will do so this coming week. Hopefully, I am on the right track to discontinue taking ANY meds. Prior to this I didn't take any medicines at all unless I was ill. I am optimistic and highly positive about my pending prognosis as I have lost 37 lbs. (still working on it) and have decided that I will continue doing what I need to do, as best as I can, to keep this under control. My main reason is ""quality of life"". I've seen Diabetes at its' worst and how it affects and has affected the lives of friends and acquaintances. I am thankful however, for breakthroughs, such as Metformin, that provide some help and hope for Diabetics.",5,3,3
"After 10 years on this medication, I went off after a colonoscopy and the Dr. warned that the met. may have caused IBS and pain, where he removed one small polyp from an otherwise clean colon. I do minimal exercises, don't take in sugar if I can help it and haven't lost weight. At one point I was on Janumet, then heard all the warnings about Januvia and went off it. Recently I was warned by another medic that Metformin could suppress effectiveness of antibiotics to fight infections and reduce effectiveness of vaccines like for shingles or the flu.",3,1,2
"I am so thirsty all the time, my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth but my PCP says that's because of the diabetes. Oddly, it only occurs after I take the pill. I'm on 500mg once a day but the doc wants me to move up to a thousand. I don't know if I can handle it. I feel so sick every day and I'm exhausted, depressed and (now) discouraged. But my doc doesn't seem to think anything is wrong. I'm not sure how much longer I'll continue to take this. I need to see some serious benefits for me to continue putting up with all these side effects. My A1c is already 6.7. I might consider going back to the holistic approach and insulin if I can find anyone to prescribe it. I had a 6.1 with 5 units of Lantus and the bitter melon. :( ",3,1,2
"After MI doctor told me I had Type II diabetes. I was given this medication. My A1C shot through the roof. I was given an increased dosage. I was on this medication for 3 years 2 months. One day I read the side effects. I was experiencing most of them. Dizziness, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, all over pain, fevers, exhaustion, and desiring to vomit. I had taken this medication as regularly as possible, multiple trips to the hospital. I thought I was having another heart attack, the hospital thought I was hypochondriac. I stopped taking in Sept of 2014. Since that time I have not had any of these problems, and my A1C is down. Please read the list of side effects and talk to your doctor about it. One size does not fit all. There are many medications out there, if you feel any of these symptoms speak to your doctor. Thanks.",3,1,1

"Took 500 mg twice daily for a year after A1C went up to 6.6.  After a year, A1C dropped to 5.9, BUT my eGFR (kidney function) fell from 72.2 to 56.4.  Stopped taking Metformin last April and eGFR rose to 65.1 after less than one month.  Since May of this year, eGFR has stabilized at around 59 but A1C is back up to 6.5  My PCP thinks I should not go back on Metformin due to the previous decline in my kidney function. If A1C continues to rise, she may put me on Farxiga, which can also lower eGFR.  Also had chronic diarrhea occurring about every 10 to 14 days while on Metformin.",3,1,2

"I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes and put on Metformin on May 21st, 2014. I started the ADA diet, using it as directed 100% for weeks – still my blood glucose did not get below 140. I questioned my doctor about my options and he said I would be on metformin the rest of my life – until moving to insulin. Meds were the only option he gave me. Then, I found the Gnuh Monix Diabetes Theorem (google it) program. Does anyone know ifthis is the real deal? It looks too good to be true. If anyone has ever tried it before, please let me know. I am getting a bit desperate on losing weight fast lately, since summer is here. I saw others have some success with it and its only like thirty bucks vs. my meds for life. Its worth it if i can jumpstart my pancrease again and reverse the diabetes. Thanks!",4,3,4

I had no idea that this was a side effect of metformin until mentioned to me by my gastroenterologist....so I have requested to be changed to something else to see if that is what is causing this problem. The drug is easy to take, but it has not done any better really in lowering my A1C than the glyburide did.",5,2,4

I know from eating less carbs (i.e 20 to 30 a meal) and eating more protein and whole grains that I actually use the restroom less due to unusable food.

Been taking Metformin since 2004.  Started with 1 500mg twice a day.  Since 2013 I am 1 500mg pill a day - 1/2 in the AM and 1/2 in the PM.  My blood sugar A1C is consistently between 5.5 and 5.7 and my daily sugar reading is between 91 and 101.  Lost the weight and the exercise helps.  Doctor wants me to continue.  I do drink a lot of water per day and I do sweat a lot which is a symptom.  ,5,5,5
"I was prescribed this product because my A1C was 7.5. In my opinion Metformin acts like a super laxative if you eat greasy heavy foods. You will feel the affects if you eat foods like pasta/hamburgers as it will be hard to digest. Then what you ate, comes out in about 2 hours. Do not take Metformin if you are going to be out amongst friends/coworkers as you will need a bathroom and privacy. So schedule your Metformin accordingly. I do miss doses if I have to, but I never double a dose. It does not curb cravings and also blocks B12 absorption. So you MUST supplement B vitamins. I had some hair shedding, and immediately the B vitamin supplements helped that issue. Accompanied with walking on treadmill, I have noticed a difference in my weight and I am happy with this product & that is why I am writing today :)",4,4,4

"What a miracle pill!  I have been taking this med for 10 mos to treat PCOS.  I finally had a period after only 3 mos of meds and have one monthly now.  Before I would go 6+ mos w/ out a period and always required BC pills.  Not ideal if I want to have kids obviously.  I have also lost 20 lbs without even trying.  Lost most of that when I exercised.  It tempered my appetite quite a bit, especially for sweets.  The stray chest and stomach hairs, another PCOS symptom, stopped growing.  I am in awe of medication that can improve my body this much.  The only con is having to take the pill 3 times a day.  Still a small price to pay for the incredible benefits.  Love it, highly recommend for anyone w/ PCOS.  ",3,5,5
"Oh the digestive issues are horrible.For the first week - DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE!If it is farther than 10 minutes, that is too far from a bathroom and I am NOT kidding! If you can make it past a few months you will start having warning time to get to the bathroom. It has not lowered my BS by much only about 30 points. Dr. is increasing to 2 tabs (1000mg) 2x a day. I lost a total of 7lbs the first week because my stomach was in knots and  I was living in the bathroom! A total of 13lbs to date after 3 months.

"No positive effect on blood sugar, my levels have increased slightly since starting. Also increased sweating. Feeling of pressure/discomfort/cramps in the stomach. Swollen ankles. Depressive thoughts, symptoms of a panic attack. I now these are from metformin as I was feeling very happy about my results and management of diabetes prior to starting the drug. Today I felt so low that I searched google to see if that could be from metformin. Apparently my symptoms are common. I will not take the medication any more, I was controlling blood sugar perfectly well with Atkins, and feeling great. My doctor does not know the way my body reacts. ",5,1,1
"I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mon.  I started taking this med that evening at about 7:15.  At around 3AM, I awoke to some cramping, like I needed to go to the bathroom.

Shortly thereafter, severe chills.  Shivered uncontrollably for almost an hour.  Was a LONG, LONG night.  Since then, I'm achey, nausea off and on, constant diarrhea.  Have lost 7 pounds since Monday.  My sister takes this and says that she was unwell for the first few weeks as well, but once her body got used to it, it was fine.

"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries last year. I've been using Metformin since then. The side effects, specifically upset stomach and diarrhea, were very troublesome in the first week or two. Afterwards, I felt better. My menstruations came back in a month or two and have been regular since. I even noticed an improvement in my body hair and how deep my voice was. I also took this in combination with birth control pills. That combination worked the best for me. By their selves, they were ok, but together they really helped me. ",2,4,4
"I was taking one 500mg tablet morning and at night. Doc increased dose to 1000mg in morning an 1000mg at night on 9/26/14 because A1C increased from 7.4 to 8.1 in one year. Now have explosive uncontrollable diarrhea at times, increased gas, stomach gurgling and also have noticed I am getting leg cramps at night. I am scheduling a colonoscopy to make sure problem is not IBS, cancer or Crohn's disease but will be talking to the doc about the dosage or other available options at my next appointment.",5,2,2

Has worked great for me. I find if I go overboard with junk food (ie:dairy and high grease foods) I get gas and some diahrea. It is a reminder to stick with more healthy options.

"I was on this medication for over a year and was taking 1000 mg twice a day. I also have UC which I was being treated for by my gastrologist. About 10 months into the treatment I started getting severe UC symptoms and they kept getting worse. My gastrologist tried everything and then completed another colonoscopy. He thought he would have to diagnose me with crohns but found out my UC had subsided, and while I was off the metformin for the prep my symptoms disappeared. When I started the metformin after the tests the symptoms came back again. My Dr immediately took me off the metformin and had my Endo Dr change my diabetic medication. I thought I was going to die on this medication. Never again will I take metformin or anything that has it in it",4,1,4

It seemed to help me lose some weight and get my numbers down, but I was watching my diet and walking daily too. I joined a rowing team and when I take Metformin it seems to make it difficult to get my muscles to perform.  The past two years I have eliminated milk and a lot of  dairy products from my diet and it helped my numbers. Sour cream and metformin do a number on me. I have lowered metformin to 250 mg and still have A1C below 7.  Taking metformin gives me a false sense of security with my diet and I will have to eat better with less of it...I plan to try a Milk Thistle supplement and see if this will help. ",1,2,4

So bad I called the Dr. on duty (Sat am). By lunch I felt better. My dr. called me first thing Mon morning and wanted to see me. I explained what happened - she had also doubled my Lipitor at the same time! Ugh! She thinks the combo was what made me feel like death, so she put me back on my 1 Lipitor a day and I haven't had any real problems since!

Now I rarely have problems taking it. I still have minor moments sometimes where I feel a bit queasy but it goes away shortly. I have some quick little jabs of pain in my arm or legs but nothing horrible. Overall very satisfied that its working and I'm able to tolerate it well now.

"I have PCOS; Metformin helped me lose & keep off 30lbs. Before taking the Metformin my weight would fluctuate drastically (30lbs in as little as 2 weeks).

We tried Januvia, then Byetta & now I am on Bydereon. I have stopped taking Metformin because it was still causing me to have hypoglycemic episodes even though the 2nd medication was supposed to help.  Being off the Metformin; I have felt better overall, don't feel slugish or dizzy.  I have a hx of being constipated so the Metformin was helping my bowels move UNTIL I started on the Januvia/Byetta/Bydereon.

A month later, there was a rash (itching) on my upper right leg where it was not visible. I felt something sticky between my legs, the rash had blistered. Doc gave creme for it, this helped a little. Small brown spot remained, then it expanded again. A round purple rash (itching) on right side of chin appeared. A round red rash developed under right arm pit. I discontinued the medication on Friday and rash under arm disappeared by Monday. Rash on face is almost gone. Rash on leg may take a lot longer to disappear due to clotting underneath skin.

I am 30 and trying to have my second child, my first I had no problems with. But I am also about 40lbs heavier. Now I at least know why.

No  diarrhea, well maybe sometimes, but nothing to get worried over. If I took 2 pills at once then I will get diarrhea. Small price to pay for keeping healthy.

Based on some of the reviews that I have read, I can see that I am one of the blessed ones for my blood sugar is lower, usually below 100 and I have no problems with the drug; not even bowel problems as some have reported and I love green salads with meals.  I also eat a lot of fresh fruit and veggies.  I avoid sugars but occasionally ""taste"" it in chocolate desserts and substitute or omit something for that taste later on in the same day. I think that if diabetics can have some kind of physical activity each day, they would  see better results and lower blood sugar numbers every day. An individual can eat to their satisfaction if they are active.  If possible, try it and see what a difference it make.  This medicine works great for me. ",5,4,4

"Since starting this medication, 1/27/2012, for treatment of Type 2 Diabetes, I have experienced weight loss coupled with walking to help alleviate the excess weight I had carried for the last several years.  Since 12/25/2011 (approx.) I have lost about 25 lbs to date (3/17/2012). If Metformin has helped (along with careful attention to diet, and addition of exercise (walking up to 30 min. daily, weather permitting), I feel Metformin has possibly been helpful for me.  However, there is one issue which has caused me to wonder if the addition of Metformin to my daily medication needs has caused me to experience ""hot flashes"", similar to that of a woman going through menopause.  I am 75, and did go through a rather severe period of time when I suffered extreme hot flashes. Very essential surgery coupled with careful attention to the addition of Premarin completely eliminated that problem, for the most part. Therefore, I can say with much specificity, I know what it feels like to experience ""hot flashes"".  Only since I have been on Metformin, have I begun to experience this recurrence of hot flashes.  I would appreciate any information concerning this possibility to be provided to me.  Thank you.",5,4,5

I have seen no change in my 84 year old mother's blood sugar.  It continues to go up and down and stays over 150 most of the time.  The doctor said to give it 90 days.

It keeps my sugar down and I have much more energy. ",1,1,5
"Has worked well for me. I did have episodes of diarrhea. But can not blame the meds for it all. Changed my diet at same time started taking drug. Much more fiber and fruits and veggies. I take 500mg 2x a day. I also take amaryl 2mg twice a day. I've noticed that stomach upset is much less severe if you take med with milk. A couple swallows before the pills helps to coat your stomach. I can not take this with water. Always heard to take diabetes meds a half hour before eating, but not this med. You have to take this with milk or with food, otherwise it will make you have a very upset stomach. If you can't do the milk, start the meal. Take the med after eating a few bites. You need to coat your stomach. This simple thing will help reduce stomach discomfort. If you eat a lot of fatty foods you will have more diarrhea problems. Been taking since 9-12-11. blood sugar 14 day average is down to 110. 30 day average is 126. I do notice some sweating issues when I eat. Maybe just a spike in blood sugar levels. Try to take med 10 to 12 hours apart. Eat lunch. If you take this to late in evening you may have lowered blood sugars to the point of needing to eat something. with me, its a 4 hour window, almost like some people on insulin. This drug hits me big time about 4 hours after I take it. Pay attention to what you eat. Moderation is the key to life. don't eat the whole cake, maybe not even a whole large slice, a few bites can be wonderful. Keep juice or milk or candy handy in case you bottom out and need to raise your sugar levels. Good luck all. Diabetes is a monster.",5,4,5
"My Ac1 was 8.4 so my Doc. started me on Metformin 500 mg. once a day. I went on a diet stopped all sugar and anything with sugar in it and lost 30lbs.. My Doc. pushed Metformin up to 500 mg. 2x a day. I found that when having sex I could not have ejaculation. I talked to the Doc. GP and Urologist and read alot on my own. I was told alot about it was caused by my diabetes, it's Retrograde ejaculation because of the diabetes the nerves in the neck of the bladder are effected and the seman backs into the bladder. Well with my readin g about the drug on Web MD I found the Metformin causes very serious dehydration. My blood  suger has been in the 90's and stayed there after cutting Metformin down to 1 500mg tab a day and drinking lots of water. The ejaculation problem went completly away, gone. So if anyone has this problem please don't take it in stride and believe everything you are told.

"I was diag'd w/PCOS and pre-diabetes almost 2 yrs ago and have been on Metformin since. I started w/500mg 2x daily and was upped to 1000mg 2x daily. The SE were horrible. My doctor just kept telling me that they would go away but they never did. I changed my diet and excercised and never lost a lb., my gym partner did the same routine and lost 20 lbs, my muscles toned up in my arms and legs but my gut was still there. Immediately upon taking the Metformin, I have severe diarreah and upset stomach no matter what I eat. I'm to the pt of not being able to do things bc I'm affraid I'm not going to make it to the bathroom on time. Some days I feel fatigued, weak and have the sensation of passing out like I have low blood sugar; this goes away after I eat something but leaves me tired for the rest of the day. However, my H1C is lower and since, my doctor has lowered my dosage back to 500mg 2x daily. My upset stomach has been a ltl better, if I have plans I just skip a dose so I don't have to worry about diarreah. Down side to lowering my dose is immediate weight gain on top of no weight loss = fatter. Also, I have had no changes in my menstral cycle which lasts up to 3 mos w/continuous bleeding that caused me to be anemic. I have taken Clomid w/no pregnancy and am currently on Lupron Depot (SE are like menopause)to shrink a fibroid and stop menstration. Really hoping to see a change after the fibroid removal...",1,3,3

Now taking 1000 mg x2; sugar plummeted from 330-440 to 135-210. Same symptoms using Metformin as without, during the period when sugar levels are being reduced -due to body not used to lowered sugar levels - nausea, diarrhea, thirst, urination, etc.  We know high A1c levels damage organs, eventually resulting in death.  Do we know that lowering levels with drugs prolongs life, when it is not curing the underlying disease? If you live long enough, DM2 will eventually & inevitably take its toll, regardless. Evidence seems to indicate that careful diet (quality of food, low carbs, etc.), exercise, and using drugs as required can extend life for a while. On side effects- I've noticed that without drugs, the DM2 population seems to have a high incidence of certain symptoms- the same ones reported on by those on medication. Perhaps in some people the drugs make them more prominent.  ",5,2,5

"Update from 2/10/11.Well I been on Metformin/Yaz birth control since Nov. 2010.I stopped taking Yaz on 6/27/11,hoping to get pregnant this year.My gyno Dr informed me after my check-up from my D&C, hysteroscopy,laproscopy surgery,that I will have a hard time conceiving due to the scar tissue in my Cervix from the LEEP procedure I had in 2007 to remove cancerous cells.So my hopes of ever be a mother was low,but I didnt want to give up.So me and my fiance agreed for me to stop my birth control and said if I get pregant great if I dont its okay too,and if after a year of trying we would go to a fertility specialist.I continue to take 500mg of Metformin 2x a day.I use the fertility Calculator on this site to find out when my fertile days are for the next 3 months.My cycle in July was on time but lasted longer since I wasnt on birth control anymore.July 27th I took a preg. test,it was negative.August we missed the week of my fertile days(7-11th) due our busy work schedules,on the 3rd and 15th we made time,I was due to have my period on Aug 20th,but it never came.My fiance was sick from 12-16th and his coworker ask him if I was pregnany because it could be the reason he is sick.I have never heard of such stuff,I thought it was pretty funny. According to Fertility Calendar I was to take a pregnancy test on 8/24/11.I been have dreams that night that I was pregnant,but its just a dream.So 530am Wed. morning I got up and took the pregnancy test and it came back POSITIVE!!.So I went and got another test,used the same urine I had in a cup,and it was POSITIVE! I sent the pic of the tests to my fiance and he was excited.I have my 1st Dr appt 9/19/11 w/a new OB to see our miracle baby.I've read that its best to continue taking Metformin through the first Trimester in order not to miscarry.I missed 2 doses yesterday becuz I wasnt sure if it was safe to stay on it,hopefully no damage is done.So dont give up ladies on trying,It can happen!

"this past january i found out i have PCOS. i have always been a bigger girl, butover the past three years since i met my boyfriend ive been increasingly active and changed my eating patterns and always try to make healthy choices. but no matter what i never loose weight. even when id br on the tredmill everyday for 45 mins she minumum. i was prescribed neuva ring which started regulating my periods. after seeing post on here about the metformin i decided to see my doctor about it.  i began monday, but i havnt had any side affects yet but i just started. i continue to work out everyday and watch what i eat. i use portion control and i eat every 3-4 hours to help my metabolism. im hoping the metformin will help me lose weight along with help with other PCOS aspects, alot of women who have reviewd this said they lost weight but also had GI problems, thats probably how they lost weight, the metformin was almost like a detox for them. but metformin is known to help with insulin resistance so i hope that it continues to work for the women as well as myself.",5,3,3
Doesn't lower my blood sugar enough taking 500 mgx2 a day.  A larger dose causes diareha.  I like the fact it doesn't cause weight gain.,5,3,3
"Have only been taking it for 3 days (500mg once a day) Numbers are down alittle, but not under 100. I take at about 6:30am and by 3:30pm I have alot of gas. Yesterday I had a headache and am very tired this morning. I will keep going to see if symptoms subside.",4,2,2
"Dr. prescribed this drug for me due to pre diabetes, a history of cysts, suspected policystic ovarian syndrome and weight gain. Have taken two to three pills a per day for three weeks or so. Side effects I've experienced since the first week include tummy swelling, nausea, fatigue, loss stools or diarrhea.  I'll stop it for a day or two and see if it gets better.  Hoped to have dropped weight by now, but it seems that I'm still as chub as I was three weeks ago; even more now with a swelled tummy. ugh!.",3,2,3
Only been on this for a few days but noticed right away extreme drowsiness the first day and stomach/diahrrea issues. Hope it helps but hope more that my body adjusts soon so I'm not so nauseous and sleepy.,5,3,3

"I recently had seen an article on Metformin causing kidney and/or bladder problems and I didn't want my husband to take it.  So he checked with his Dr.s PA and he said they monitored it well and not to worry about it.  My wife also said she saw on TV that Actos and Avandia (both diabetes meds) caused bladder and/or kidney cancer.  Well, today we found out my husband has bladder cancer. Now what?  ",5,1,5
"Had an A1C of 126 last August using Glipizide XL.  Kaiser pharmacist called and said it was too expensive and replaced it with generic Glipizide.  Levels shot up.  No changes in lifestyle.

I haven't had any complications as of yet while taking Metformin.,5,5,5
"I've been on Metformin for a few weeks now, with no complications. In fact, I feel like a brand new person.  I have plenty of energy, I think more clearly, and overall, I just feel better!! When my doctor prescribed the medication two months ago, I held off with taking it at first.  If I only knew it was going to make me feel so much better, trust me, I would've taken it much sooner!!!  Thank God for Metformin! I feel so much better and my glucose levels are at normal range!!",5,5,5

Glucophage was effective to control the blood sugar. Unfortunately I got a very bad reaction by having serious skin rashes. I would like to know of other substitute medication in the same price range. The other latest medications are sky high priced,2,1,4
"For those of you who are feeling sick on the medication, please start with a lower dose.  I started this drug several years ago to deal with the problems related to PCOS.  Very soon I started menstruating regularly and within 6 months I was pregnant.  PCOS can have many negative long term affects on your health so it must be treated.  When i started the full dose I felt sick to my stomach, diarhea, etc.  I lowered the dose to 1/4 of that by only taking half a pill a day.  No side effects and turns out I don't need to increase my dose because the low dose works for me and has for the past 7 years.  This mediation is a miracle  - I highly recommend it.",5,5,5

I was diagnosed with PCOS followed by insulance resistance after a Glucose Tolerance Test. I initially went to a fertility specialist after irregular cycles and no pregnancy. He prescribed 500mg of metformin 2x day. I had no side effects at all even thought I started taking two pills instead of one for the first week as he recommended. I'm crossing my fingers I get pregnant soon. ,4,4,3
"Have been taking this mediaction for 15+ years and have found it very effective. Because of being older, my diabetes has grown and now I take it in combination with Solostar (Insulin) and with the combo, I do very well. If I exercised more, dieted more and watched what I ate more, I probably be in even better shape, but like many of you, I like to enjoy life as it is, as long as I have. I see too many people who are 85, have diabetes in the hospital with tubes, one leg or foot, and just miserable. I'd rather keep it going, sugar between 92-140 and enjoy what time I have.

So far I have lost about 10 pounds. I sure it could have been more if I ate a healthy diet and exercised more often. My cycle are regular every month with the help of Yaz birth control. No more cramping, only mild :) Had 3 month ultrasound follow up appt in January all my cyst are gone except for a large on in my right ovary,Dr said nothing to be concerned about, the birth control will help control the size. No endometrosis. Everything looks good. And I dont have to go back to see my gynocologist until i'm ready to start a family (hopefully around August when I get married in September) and for my annual screenings. So in the mean time i'm going to force myself to be more active and exercise at least 15mins a day, and eat healthier meals. So don't give up ladies!!! Take care and God bless",5,5,4
The metformin that I take is doing a fine job of controlling my diabetes.,5,5,5
I have used it in conjunction with insulin. It kept my sugar levels down but I could not contol diarrhea Found out lately that my kidney function is impaired. Could it be caused by prolonged use of metformin ?,1,1,4
"I started taking this medicine a week ago. SO far I feel great. My first doctor did a laproscopic to remove a cyst. I then ended up with multiple cysts in one ovary and one large cyst in the other. Another surgery was recommended. I got a second opinion. No surgery was needed the first time...quite ineffective for PCOS (the cysts come back). So far my cycle was finally lighter, my energy level is up and with a healthier lifestyle I am told that the metformin can be taken out of the equation. Currently on 500 mg. extended release three times a day. Must stay hydrated. Always get a second opinion with PCOS.",5,4,3

i have had diarrhea so bad all day long that it has turned completly liquid and sounds as if urinating,2,1,1
I'm thinking that only people who complain about drugs write these reviews.  I had little to no problems when I started this drug.  I took 1000 mgs for two days and then due to a BS of 353 they wanted me to go to 2000mg.  After a month I range from 90 to 140 which is not too bad.  I will be curious to see how my A1C turns out.  It was a whopping 15.1%.  I had a little extra gas and that was it.  The drug stopped my thirst problem almost overnight which in turn stopped the constant urination and I was able to sleep a whole night for the first time in over a year.  With time it has corrected my blurred vision also.  The drug has thusfar been a godsend for me.  No complaints here.  ,5,5,5
see no difference,4,4,4

I used to control my my diabetes by diet and exorcise but I have been unwell with joint pain. I wish I could find a good diet and realistic exorcise plan  but some how I seem to banging my head against a brick wall I have my bloods taken every three months by the diabetic nurse but she seems very reluctant to change my medication.",2,2,2
I have been on Metformin for 18 mos. My doctor started me on 2000mg a day. I think the dosage was too much for mt system but I stayed with it. The first month was hell. Diarrhea and nausea ruled my life. Then during the 4th week I felt somewhat normal. At 6 weeks my numbers were way down and the dosage was reduced to 1000mg a day. This drug works well with some exercise and following a diet. Anything beats having to take shots.     ,5,4,4
"Started with upset stomache, but didn't think it was medication.  Then the diarhea collitis began(it is called slow stomach, and is created by metformin).

"Starting taken medication almost two weeks and feel worse than I did. My blood sugar bottoms out, nausea, and headaches are a daily occurrence. I talked to my doctor about going off this because it is so bad, but he does not want me to and said give it three months. I am not sure I can do this for three months. Is there something else I can do to treat POS?",1,1,1
"My doctor prescribed this for me less than a year ago (500mg twice a day).  It gave me diarrhea.  So I started taking it just once in the morning and feel much better.  I know its half the prescribed dose but my A1C is at 7 which the doctor liked, but he would prefer if it were 6.5 or less.

Used this drug for 3 years; started at 500 mg and ended at 2000 mg.

o.k. for me,4,4,4
While this drug started to help my type 2 diabetes it also helped my kidneys into acute renal failure.  Looks like my doctor did put me on to high a dose too soon though.  Definitely talk to your doctor before taking metformin.,5,1,3
"I find in higher doses I have more bowl movements than necessary, more like diarria",4,2,4
"This is only my second day taking this drug (was diagnosed a few days ago with diabetes, PCOS, and hypothyroidism), but I think it is helping with regulating my blood sugar from what I can tell.  I only take 500 mg in the morning so it's very easy to use.  The side effects are a little hard to deal with sometimes, especially the headaches, tiredness, dizziness, and diarrhea, but I think that will go away with time (hopefully!).  I'm also on another medicine too and I'm lactose-intolerant, so some of those could be related to those things as well...or the fact that I am completely addicted to sugar and now I'm in withdrawal!  So far, so good though.  :)",5,4,4
"It seem too control my blood level, but i am losing too much weight, i was a thin person when i started taking it, and i dont need too lose any weight.",5,4,4
I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 18 years old. I am now 24. I never had treatment for PCOS up until January of 2010 because I was having non stop bleeds. I was put on metformin and it regulated my cycle immiedetley. I also managed to lose 140lbs while on the drug. I initially started my lifestyle change November of 2009 and started metformin that foloowing January. I had a consistant cycle from January till August. In August my gall bladder was infected and had to be removed with surgery. That caused a little bit of fluxuation of my cycle. Other than that this medication has been a wonderful drug *for me anyways*. Not all results are the same I am sure. I highly any woman with PCOS and starting to live a healthier lifestlye with healthy diet and exercise should try this drug. It is not a magic pill. Along with diet and exercise can be effective.,5,5,5
"For the past 2 months, I took metformin twice daily at 250 mg for 1 week and 500 mg for the next 2 weeks, then 500 mg in the morning and 750 mg at night, to 500 mg in th morning and 1000mg at night along with 20 units of Lantus. The gradual build up  of the metformin decreased the gas and bathroom visits. Taking Vitamin B complex that includes Vitamin B12 and eating yogurt (100 calories) daily minimizes the strong gas. Metformin helps my liver from releasing glucose so FBG ranges from 77 mg/dl to 130 mg/dl. Still working on getting consistent FBG less than 100 mg/dl by minimizing carbohydrate intake at dinner, so most carbs are consumed before 4 p.m. Lantus and metformin worked, since I tried Actos, Januvia and Metformin for 1 month then added Lantus starting at 10 units when HbA1C was at 13 mg/dl. Talked with physician assistant to use Lantus and metformin but stopped metformin after 2 months with a urinary tract infection. Read the earlier reviews and decided to try metformin. HbA1C is 7.5 mg/dl after 10 months. I was diagnosed with diabetes 16 years ago and controlled it mainly by diet and exercise for the past 10 years till early 2010 when genetics of both parents set in - not overweight. Thank you to the early reviewers. ",5,4,4

"UPDATE FROM POST ON 10/10/10 .. Well I went for my f/u appt on 10/26/10 after my D&C, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy on 9/16/10 the news wasn't good. My NEW Gyno informed me I had alot of scar tissue in my cervix that was due to a LEEP procedure in 2007 to remove cancerous cells from my cervix. I bled quite a bit during the procedure & my OLD Dr had to cauterize alot of my vessels in my cervix to stop the bleeding. Then after that I switched to depo shots for 4ys,I didn't have a period for 3yrs. So now Im diagnosed w/ cervical stenosis (narrowing of the cervix) which explains the spotting,and severe cramping and fluid in my uterus that was found during my ultrasound in Aug. Dr stated she had a hard time inserting the instruments thru my cervix during my surgery. She lasered the cysts in my ovaries and cleaned out my uterus.She said if I had endometriosis it was in the beginning stages.It was caused from me unable to release all my menstural blood b/c the opening of my cervix was so small.The severe cramping is due to the pressure of the blood trying to go thru the small opening.She wasn't able to exam my fallopian tubes b/c there was some scar tissue there. She stated I will have a difficult time getting pregnant due to the scar tissue.However,it is good that im spotting and have a light period, it means my cervix isnt completely closed, so there hope. She has prescribed me Metformin and Yasmin birth control to regulate my cycle in hopes of opening up my cervix. She doesnt want me to start both meds until my cycle next month in Nov. Im a little worried about taking Yasmin-BC, I know there is a law suit currently out there on this product due to the side effects.I researched and read post about Yasmin and most women dont recommend it.But I will put trust in my NEW Dr and see how things go, and will notify her of any side effects from the BC pill. I Will update in Jan 2011 to let yall know how things are going. Take care, and God bless :-)",3,3,3
"I started taking this medication in April 2010 for PCOS/borderline diabetes/high testosterone. I have lost 50lbs since then, and just went back this week for new blood work. No results yet.

I had to stop this medication due to tingling in my fingers and feet.My Doctor did not think this was the reason but it went away when I stopped it for a couple of days.I had to go back in urgent care because of this problem worsening and feeling very tired.I have stopped it now as my doctor advised. The feet already feel better after two days but still having some in my fingers. My energy level is good now. No more Metforming for me.     ,4,2,3

Well have to take at night and wait to take my other pills at least 1/2hr.don't see any help it is giving me. Like to drink wine 3 nites a week wait 2 hours before taking medicine.,3,3,3
one experience taking this medication is taking it with milk rather than water works best for me,5,4,5

"Hello all.First all of I would like to say I love this website,so much helpful info. Aug 23,2010 I was diagnosed w/endometriosis and PCOS via ultrasound.I had no idea I had those conditions! I was on Depo Provera injections for 4yrs,Nov 2009 was my last injection and I havent had a period for 3yr 10mths now.I was taking birth control pills before the shots since I was 21. I am now 29yrs. Ive recently gotten engaged and we talk about have a baby in the future.Since I'm yet to start my cycle from being off of Depo shots, I had my doubts that I may never become a mother. So my Dr told me she want to do a D&C to clean out my uterus, and a hysteroscopy,laporascopy to look at my uterus and ovaries, that was on 9/16/10. So I did some research on this site about PCOS and notice the medication Metformin is prescribed for my condition and to regulate my cycle and lose weight. After reading the posts on here, it really has giving hope for me and my future husband to one day have a bundle of joy of our own. Im due to have my follow up appt on 10/19/10 and I will ask my Dr about putting me on this medication. The thought of losing weight for my wedding(I gained over 40lbs on the Depo shot,most of it in stomache area,also alot of facial chin hair) and increase my fertility all at the same time,excites me! I have learn from other womens post how to take it and reduce the side effects. I will update my post later down the road to let yall know how things work out. Good luck to all, and keep posting. Knowledge is power!! Talk to you soon, take care :)",3,3,3
"I have been on the drug for about 6 months. However, working with my doctor and experimenting somewhat I have found the best combo for effectivness and less side effects. Here are my tips: 1. Gradually work up to the desired dosage. This may take you 1 week; for others 6 weeks. 2. Eat with a meal! 3. Drink plenty of water with the dose. 4. Meals that are high in fat (pizza is a killer!) and sugar (no dessert!) are what cause me to have the worse side effects.  I have lost 20lbs, BS is right on the money. I like the fact that it kills my appetite so I don't snack unhealthy.",5,5,5
"I have been taking this medication for a week now for fertility issues, My Dr. prescribed it in hope that it would regulate my cycles and help with ovulation. I have had nausea,dizziness,weakness a little upset stomach I am taking this med twice a day, at 500mg. I am hopeing that the side effects will deminish within the next week",5,3,3
Lost 9 pounds already (in 1 month) and made my cycles regular. Using for PCOS/Pre-Diabetes and it works great! Hoping to get pregnant soon!,4,4,4
I was given this medication because I could not lose weight.  I have graves disease.  I have lost 15 pounds since starting this medication.,5,5,5
"I started with 500 mg twice a day.  At first it helped BG levels.  Some nausea, slight headache.  Just didn't feel good a lot of the time.  My doctor increased my dosage to 1000 mg twice a day, and I have been feeling lousy since.  Diarhea with no warning, nausea, headache, bad taste in mouth.  My morning readings are still high.  But I have lost 6 lbs.  Called my doctor, waiting to hear from her.  Do I hang in there hoping these side effects go away?",4,1,3

"Diagnosed w/PCOS. My bloods/tests were 100% FABULOUS. Female, 44, don't take any other pills or meds. Dr. gave me this to lose weight. Could not lose weight w/extreme exercise and extreme healthy eating for 16 months. Took 500mg 2x daily for 4 wks then 1000mg 2x daily for 5 weeks. Had severe DIARRHEA all day long for 9 weeks without fail. I stopped pills for 3 days, felt GREAT and NO DIARRHEA. Now back to 500mg 2x daily until I feel I can increase it. My intestines on meds hurt until I exploded out all the food in my guts. I did NOT lose any weight in 9 weeks, so I am only going to try this for a few more months and then I will be my own doctor and take myself off of this. There is nothing else I can do to lose weight. I also hurt myself in many places because of too much exercise, now I cannot exercise at all. ",1,1,1
"I have been on metformin for over 4 years for PCOS & Pre-diabetes. It has worked wonderfully for me. It has corrected my abnormal menstrual cycle and helped to lower blood sugar levels. I have rarely experienced stomach upset, only when taking it on an empty stomach. I have found that it is extremely important to take it as close to 12 hours apart as possible.",5,5,5
Prolonged use has resulted in severe diarea,4,1,3

However after two years of pre-diabetes diagnosis and treatment I had hope to reverse the condition, I still have low numbers always < 95 fasting and <110 after major meals. However I guess to have numbers like that without meds, I will have to step up my level of exercise. Get in the 1 hour exercise every day. I really need to get rid of about 15-20lbs. Also I need to get rid of the rice from my diet.    ",5,4,4
It has made me ill. Lots of stomach issues.,3,2,3
only started today...no complaints yet...hope all goes well.will keep an update,5,3,2
"Initially, my BS actually increased.  However, I have been taking particular care with my diet and today it is down to 167 and hopefully will continue downwards.  Should I take the Metformin with or without food?",5,3,3
I find it easy to take and I take one tablet at night and the only part is remember to take but has been effective in the treatment.,5,5,4
Constipation and severe heartbrun are directly related to start of this medication.  Anyone experience any sexual side effects?   I am suddenly having issues with maintaining an erection. ,3,1,5
"It does not seem to take my blood sugar level down enough. I also experience one hour after taking Metformin. sleepiness occurs, hard to stay awake.",2,2,3
"I was diagnosed with PCOS when i was 17, was not given metformin until i was 33 at that time was given 2000mg a day which was to much for me to handle, severe diareah,nausea, etc. Was prescribed metformin again when I was 40 at 1000mg a day which works beautifully. I had the stomach issues, nausea etc for about 3 weeks but not like before. This drug had helped alot, first month I dropped 10 lbs and no longer have any stomach issues. My doctor also has put me on Angelique a monthly hormone, I use to have weekly headaches, migraines, severe cravings, you name it I had it. The combo of these drugs is a godsend. I have only had 4 headaches in 4 months, cravings are very low, a feeling of well being is what I have. I actually feel normal now. Regarding getting pregant- I took glucophage it made perids normal but no help in preg dept. I went to fertility specialist. They put me on Prenatels, one baby aspirin a day and Rezulin it took 4 months and I was pregnant. Immediatly took me off of Rezulin but kepted me on a baby aspirin and prenatels until i reached my first trimester then only prenatels. Good luck ladies there is hope. ps got pregnat again after my first baby. happy mom of two-before the Rezulin I had a a laproscopy on uterus with dye, and hormone injections, and 4 IUI'S with no luck until Rezulin, baby aspirin, and prenatels. Maybe a suggestion for your doc. Again good luck",5,4,5

He lost 80 lbs. in 6 months and became so weak from the side effects of this medicine, especially the diarreha, another Dr. thought he had cancer!!  Finally got him to my Dr. and he told him he sees this alot from this medicine and immediatly pulled him off of it.  2 days later...it was a miracle.  He's back to his old self again and we couldnt have been happier for him! Please see your Dr if the fatiuge gets severe.",1,1,2
I should be taking 1000mg of metformin in morning and the same at night. I got real bad irritable bowel when I took it in the morning. I wish I could still take it and not have irritable bowel.,5,3,3
"Metformin is my nightmare. Had such raging restroom episodes my work nearly called the ambulance multiple times. This was when I was on only 1 pill a day. Flushing, heart palpitations when I would go to the bathroom. I thought I was having a stroke or heart attack. Ended up in ER with dehydration despite drinking more than adequate amount of liquids. It is debilitating to take this med. The. Worst part is that it didn't lower my sugars much, my a1c actually went up significantly and it didn't help with weight loss... even with not being able to keep anything in my body. And I was dieting. I was on this med for 2 years and symptoms only got worse. I have switched to Januvia and feel so much better. I have my life back again! Praise God!",3,1,1
The only problem I have with this medication is it caused me to have Lactic acidosis. Other than that it works very well and makes me feel better ,5,5,4
Has kept my type 2 diabetes in a good control  I have grave concerns regarding precaution with pet scan and renal side effects/,5,3,4
I am taking 1000 mg twice a day for almost 6 months now.  I battle with severe stomach problems.  I can no longer eat breakfast cause of the taste in my mouth and the sick feeling in my stomach every morning.  Another problem is the diarrhea that has almost stopped me from going anywhere.  However my bs is doing better.,1,1,2

caused me to have severe episodes of diarrha,5,1,1
When I first started on Metformin I experienced the nausea and diareah a lot of people experience but it passed after about two weeks. I have been excersising for about six months now and my blood sugar seems to be leveling out but I am experiencing a good deal of vertigo so I've made an appointment with my doctor to have an A1C done to see if maybe I can come off the Metformin and that may help with the vertigo and dizziness.,5,4,4
"diagnosed with PCOS, i have had trouble loosing weight for the past year. i've been on metformin for a month, and already i have lost more weight, and my hunger is curbed quite a bit. i am also following a healthy diet/workout program but i think the metformin has been the biggest help. I have had some side effects; diarrhea the first few days, and off and on again nausea and mild heartburn, but the benefits outweigh the side effects for me. it's a blessing not to be insatiable starving all the time and losing weight again!",3,4,5
shortness of breath. I am on insulin Humulin r Novolin 70/30 I was taking glybride 5mg  bid but wasnt working out doctor put me on metformin I felt sick in the stomcach. N/v but after a week it got better.,3,3,3

"I haven't click too many stars and the reason for that is I started to take this pill one week ago (friday 08/06/2010)and I read that it will take up to two weeks for the pill to be effective,so far my glucose levels are down to 200mg/dl, and as far as me , I loss more than 30 lbs, I used to weight 225  lbs now my weight is 187 lbs,By the way my blood pressure is high too. I changed my eating habits, I have the ""rabbit"" diet herbs,veggies, no  bad carbohydrates to eat and no sodas(including diets)which I don't like. Temptation is always in the fridge, but I have to say only ""hello"" to them.They are not part of my diet now.I ""divorce"" them.",5,3,2
"Diagnosed with T-2 Diabetes back in 1999.  Pulled Blood Sugars in line with diet & exercise, but after 10 years, it looks like I'll need some help from my pharmacist to keep my numbers on track.  Metformin may work, may not, but if I don't see the results I want in the first 30 days, I'll be having a long talk with my Doc.  If your not seeing Blood Sugars in your personal ""target zone"" you need to talk with your Doc too.  If you have to deal with gas & other side effects, you should at least get the desired effect of lowered Blood Sugars.    ",4,3,3
"I am an MD, and I have about 300 diabetic patients, and I am myself a diabetic. I prescribe and use metformin. The only side effects of note are intestinal problems, and perhaps some patients are more susceptible than others. To decrease or avoid these problems, take metformin with a meal, and eat plenty of fiber; taking psyllium helps decrease gas. Most people here think that anything that happens to them is because of the medicine. I don't blame them, though; I know that many doctors do not educate their patients, or even talk with them!",5,5,5
severe headaches,1,1,2
"I have not reached full dose yet so am still hopeful that it will work. So far, it has not lowered my blood sugar at all.",5,2,1

"I've been taking Metformin for about a month for PCOS, I still have not seen any results. My husband and I are trying to get pregnant, so I'm still waiting to see if this works. I did have a menstrual cycle 2 weeks after beginning this treatment. I hadn't had one in several months when I was started on Metformin. I take 1000mg twice daily, and I find that it gives me stomach trouble (severe nausea, occasional diarrhea, occasional vomiting) and I am looking for a treatment for the nausea. I still take my doses daily, but it is very difficult to function when you're sick all day. Taken with food, this drug is far more tolerable. Hopefully we will see some results soon as far as the fertility issues go, and if it works, it was worth the pain and suffering. Will review again when I see some results. ",3,3,2
it works but i have diarreha all the time.,4,3,3
"I ended up with metalic tast in  mouth, uncontrolled blood sugars, fatigue, steatohepatitis with cirosis.  I took this medicine for 5 + years.",4,1,2
In my situation it is the beginning of the end. I already have heart disease and now diabetes (very bad combination). Tried most diabetes meds including Metformin but the side effects were very serious with all meds so I had to stop. My A1C is 7.1. and BS is about 150 and rising. I would appreciate inputs from anyone with the same condition. ,1,1,1
"Diagnosed with Type 2 a little over 3 months ago - started on 500mg of Metformin twice a day. Lots of gas the first few weeks. I have colon problems anyway, so am used to diarrhea, but diarrhea symptoms have changed and not for the better, though not as often as before. BS has dropped from 322 to 113 in less than 3 months - not sure if it's the med. or my new eating habits and more exercise. Pretty happy with results, overall!",5,4,5
Have any females experienced any hormonal effect taking this drug? It hasnt really brought my bs down (staying between 140 and 180) and I have noticed some cramping similar to menstrual cramps... ,3,2,2
i get diarea,4,1,3
"I haven't had any of the listed side effects except that I am more gassy.  However, my cholesterol went up 40 points in three months since starting this drug.  My doctor says it is probably due to the diabetes but I think its the medicine.  Has anyone else experienced this?",5,3,3
"Started at 500mg and each week added more to reach 1500MG per day.  After waiting 3 months for a period i got one after just 2 weeks of taking metformin.  Currently @ 2.5 weeks into treatment, down 7lbs, tired, dizzy, but hanging in there.  Frequent, painful diarahea immediately upon starting meds which i have since fixed completely.  I now take fiber supplements with every metformin dose and am no longer running to the bathroom. Making better food choices will make taking this medicine much easier on you.  I am reminded very quickly when i get off course.  =)",5,4,4
"Stomach upset, bowel aching, gas, bloating,fatigue, fall asleep after taking. Was told by Dr, well you shouldn't have gotten diabetes. He was the one that gave me the wrong meds for other problem, bringing on the diabetes. HAHA",2,1,2
seems to do the job at 1500 mg per day.,5,4,4
"I am on Metformin because I am insulin resistent. My dr informed me I could continue with diet and excercise or take metformin until I lose the weight. With weight loss she would expect my fasting blood sugar to drop in normal range.  However, right after I take it I get EXTREMELY tired. It feels like I took a sleeping drug.  I feel like I've been knocked out. And it makes me feel sick. Like constant nausea. No diarrehea. I am on 500mg once a day and am supposed to up it to twice I believe.  However I have the extended release so its like the symptoms come and go. I go from being exhausted to uppity and back and forth.  I really might quit taking it. Anyone else know the reason it makes you so tired? ",1,1,3
"I have been on this medication for over a year now and at first the medication really worked, but now my sugar says over 200 almost all the time. I have constant dirrhea from the medication on top of my irritable bowl. I have a dr's appt very soon to get my sugar checked out. ",5,1,2
I started taking metformin two years ago. I have lost over 80 lbs. my bs is controlled. I did have trouble with diarrea at first but changed my diet to compensate. I do feel tired after taking meds but on the whole i am satisfied with the results.,5,3,5
"It does help lower blood sugar, however, I get sleepy after taking each dose, urine has a funky smell, constantly tired heavy leg feeling. Started on Advandamet and moved to this about a year ago. Blood sugar levels have started going up lately. Started this because my Doc said it would help morning levels come down - they were 210 to 230. With this my morning levels are closer to 150 to 190 - still too high. I just started Victoza, anxious to see results.",5,3,3
I have just started taking this medication.  No problems so far. BG readings have dropped 40 to 60 points in 3 days.  Does any one drink 1-2 glasses of wine at dinner with this medication?  The warnings concern me but I wonder if any one does it with out side effects.  ,5,5,5
"I took it for several years and then began having severe diahhrea...most often in the evenings after taking my evening dose. I was on 1,000 mg in am and same at bedtime. Dr. finally advised discontuing all and it mostly alleviated the  problem. ",4,2,3
"taking 1000 mg twice a day.. really don't think it helps that much, but seems to be nothing else out there safe..",4,2,2
Tired sometimes no get up an go,4,2,3
This medication had a severe reaction on my instentical tract. I experienced severe diarea. I took this med about 3 weeks and couldn't take it anymore. I hated this medication.  I was afraid to leave my office or home without knowing were the closest bathroom was,4,1,2
"I am 44 years old and was not dignosed with PCOS until I was 38 years old. I was told metformin would improve my symptoms which include insulin resistance, weight gain, acne, excess facial hair, and irregular periods. I could no longer take birth control to regulate the symptoms so I gave it a try about 2 years ago. I am very happy with the results. Initally, I was on 500mg/ twice a day, now I am taking it 3 times a day. I have experienced some diarrhea, but I have recently changed my diet to include protein at every meal along with more whole grains and fiber. Eating out is a challenge, but if I monitor what I eat then I can usually figure out what caused it and avoid it in the future. High carbs, fried foods and sugar seem to worsen the diarrhea. I lost 20lbs the first year and since increasing the dose I have lost another 28lbs. I am finally at a healthy BMI, no acne, somewhat regular periods (30-35 days)and a reduction of the facial hair. Always take your medication with a meal,use as directed by your doctor, and avoid foods that high fat, high sugar, and high carbs to avoid unpleasant side effects. ",4,5,5

This is my first week on it and I have discovered that the severity of the side-effects depend on what I eat. I go fine on simple grains, vegies and fruit.  I get severely sick when I ate high-fat foods, vomited when I ate a cheeseburger.  I like the way this is forcing me to change my diet, I watch what I eat and keep Imodium around -I'm good.  After 4 days I have dropped 6lbs (also started exercising daily) and my blood sugar was 166, so it is slowly dropping.  I plan on staying with it and hoping the benefits will out-weight the side-effects.",5,3,4

I first was to take twice a day (long acting), then up to 3 times a day and then I could take as many as four a day.  This past week I have taken as many as five a day with a blood sugar continually on the high, high side.  I don't understand this.  I have had trouble from the first trying to keep my sugars low.  Some of this is my fault, not being careful with what I ate, but I have been able to keep it down in the 120's, usually. At night I kick it up to at least 135, because I don't know if my sugars will drop at night.  I don't have a doctor who is interested and with the plan I am on they don't offer very many good doctors.

Had to call family to meet me and take me to the Hospital. I have had numerous test run (Heart, Liver, Kidney, CT scan for my head, Lungs) and everything was good. The doctor says it is anxiety. It's now a month later and I am still dizzy, headache, burning stomach, and can't seem to control my diabetes. I finally convinced my doctor that this had something to do with my diabetes. He told me to stop taking the Metformin. It is just the second day but I am feeling better. Perhaps this is a bad batch of medicine. But how can I prove this?",3,2,3

I read the sugar readings many of you have and anything under 200 is the goal.e the side effects are worth having lower readings. i think when metformin is taken with food, or yogurt it doesnt effect your stomach so bad. Also the higher doses dont help. Thats hwere something like Lantus or Byetta combined with metformin will be better. Metformin is also the only drug for diabetics that significantly reduces bad cholestrol and triglicerides. it also helps to let you lose weight where insulin makes you gain weight. But with Byetta which isnt an insulin you will see your weight drop as well as the high blood sugars.",3,5,5

Was on Metformin for only 3.5 weeks when my Dr wanted to see me to see how it was working. My BS went from 434 to the 102-112 range after first reading of the day before breakfast.  I had also lost 18 pounds in the 3.5 weeks but my Dr did not think that was good enough. Before I knew it he was giving me a 30 day supply of Byetta (5 mg in the morning and evening)  I felt that putting me on another drug only after giving Metformin 3.5 weeks with good results was a little aggresive. I am 6' tall and weigh 184 pounds. My BS range is now 80-112 24 hours a day. Anyone out there that is on Metformin and Byetta?,5,3,4
47 year old male.  I have been taking this med for a couple of weeks.  I only had one day of slightly loose stoll.

This drug started it. Now we have to wait and see if I have another one or if it was just the one time. The major problem with this medication is the almost unbearable nausea. I've spent a few evenings and mornings on the bathroom floor, almost hoping to vomit.  Other stomach issues come and go. I've figured out that if I take the pill 20 minutes AFTER eating, it helps me have less nausea most of the time. It's not a fool-proof cure, but it is better than it was. In the end, I'll take the nausea for the chance to get pregnant. ",2,3,4

It causes constipation.  I guess that is better than the alternative that I have heard and read about.  Other than that it makes me very sleepy to the point of not being able to function.  Seems like my mind is fuzzy at times.  At least it is working very well at bringing my BS down to normal ranges.  My A1C was at 434 3 weeks ago. I have lost over 14 pounds in two weeks.  This of course may also be due to my cutting out carbs nearly completely. My weight was at 210 and am now at 196. I am 6' tall.  My goal is to get down to 175 lbs.,5,3,5

My headaches and burning in the eyes have caused me to go to bed early due to the eye blinking and squinting over and over. I am taking Restasis and another prescription for the problem but they aren't really working. The headaches are frontal migraine pain. Blurry vision is constant.

I have had all sorts of tests done for my back pain with nothing being found to be wrong with me.  I so a differant Dr. recently because of severe abdominable pain and still severe constipation, she did several tests, my intestines are total impacted, talked to me about the metformin and advised me that it can cause gastro-intestinal problems and possible constipation.

I went to the E.R. and the Dr. suspended me taking the Actos and januvia. Blood tests showed that the Kidney and Liver function was not good to no more metformin for 1 week. I feel much better today just taking the Glucoltrol XL and the numbers was 150 this morning. Even with the Actos and Metformin numbers were 130-150.

After all we know our bodies better than them. I will refuse to start back the metformin and insist to see if my diet and exercise regime will work. Will see. If not I will inform Dr. and go from there. But Actos and Januvia was not good for me. Metformin after taking it 13 years at max dose to me is just a money maker for the Dr's. Holla if you want to discuss this. [email protected]",3,3,4
"I have had trouble with my cycles since I was 14 years old. I would go sometimes 6 months or more without having a period. Then when I would have a period I would suffer from heavy bleeding, extremely bad cramps, headaches, and extreme fatigue. Things got better after my first child was born for about 4 months. Then it went back to the same awful periods and then to just no periods at times. I started taking Metformin in December of 2008 and it took effect by my Janurary cycle. I suffered from stomach pain and nausea for about 2 weeks then it went away.  I found out in June that I was pregnant. Which suprised my fiance and me. I was and am very pleased with this medication. I plan to begin it again as soon as my OB says I can start after my son is born.",3,5,5

"I started taking metformin after being diagnosed with PCOS. I began taking it not only for pre-diabetes, but also to regulate my period (I don't have a period at all, on or off metformin. I tried first using various types of birthcontrol to regulate my periods, but for some reason my body didnt tolerate them. My period would began on birthcontrol but they would be very heavy and they wouldnt stop no matter the brand or dosage.) Well since I've started (3yrs ago) taking metformin (1000mg daily), i've yet to have a period and now instead of taking it for pre-diabetes, i now have type 2 diabetes. I've also taken chlomid as well to try and get pregnant. Need I say that after 3yrs with the metformin, I now actually have diabetes, I still can't have a period or get pregnant. As far as the side effects, I also suffer from thyroid disease and RA so I'm extremely fatigued, tired,i have mood swings, a bit of depression,my joints and bones ache everyday, i gain and lose weight alternately, my hair thins horribly, i still have excessive hair growth, and i experience diarrhea often, but nausea is a constant every day thing.

I just started back on Metformin for PCOS my husband and I are trying to get pregnant. Over the past year I have had significant facial hair and weight issues and I am really hoping that this med will help that. I tried earlier this year to take it and my stomach just couldnt handle it but after going to a specialist and bloodwork they are trying again i am starting out on 500 mg once a day and then gradually up to three times a day. Has anyone had success with weight  and facial hair issues with this drug? Any advice?,5,5,5
"Because of side effects, primarily diarrhea, my doctor told me to begin taking metformin by crushing a tablet and eating a little bit from the end of my licked finger.  She saved my life!  With the first tiny dose I immediately turned scarlet and started into anaphylaxis.  At my wife's prompting, I instantly took 50 mg of Benadryl.  The symptoms did not get worse, but the red face took 1 1/2 hour to go away.  I would suggest to anyone beginning treatment with metformin that they begin with the same caution my doctor showed.",5,5,1

The sometimes uncontrollable diarrhea. The stomach cramps that leave me in the fetal position in bed unable to move sometimes for an hour or more. 2 months ago MD added Actos gained 12lbs in 7 weeks. Last week I saw a colleague of his to help manage the diabetes. I am starting Byetta, 5mg, this weekend. (In case of side effects.) If I tolerate onto 10mg then insulin. At last check 3 RX for BP. 2 RX for Cholesterol. 3 RX for diabetes. I am still living Thank God for that. But I always have that fear of liver or pancreas failure/cancer.

"I began taking Metformin in December 08 for Insulin Resistance Syndrome which is normally associated with PCOS. I found that not eating enough and not allowing my food to coate my stomache would cause me to get nauseous when taking my daily doses (1000mg twice a day). I started at 500 mg for a week, then increased to my daily dose of 2000 mg. My dr. told me to eat enough to make sure I coate my stomache and wait about 20 minutes before taking my dose. It helped significantly. I no longer get sick after taking it unless I didn't eat enough or allow the food to coate my stomache. My cycles used to be 7-10 days with heavy flow; it has decreased to 3-4 days with only one day of heavy flowing. The cramps during cycles have also decreased and are not has severe. I have not experienced any weight loss though. I experienced diarrhea about 6 months into treatment but Metformin has actually regulated me. Where I used to go once a week, if that, off my cycle, and once everyday while on my cycle. Now, I'm going on a daily basis. Overall, I'm quite impressed with the medication once my amazing dr. tweeked how I was taking it and offered solutions to get through the side effects. I would suggest patience and persistence with Metformin because in the beginning for me it was disheartening and very frustrating; especially the nausea. Overall, it has worked well for me when taking correctly and consistently. My husband and I both are very pleased with its effectiveness.",2,5,5
"I'm 25, my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 18 months and one year ago I was diagnosed with PCOS.  My Dr. immeidately started me on Metformin beginning with 500mg/day for one week, increasing by 500mg/day each week after that until I now take 2000mg/day.  It took approximately 6 months for the Metformin to regulate my period without jump-starting it with Provera, when it did start I had a 12 day, extremely heavy period, and then 10 days later I had another 14 day period, the heaviest I've ever had in my life.  I had taken Clomid for two months before the Metformin started to regulate my period and it didn't work, so we waited until we got results on the Metformin for a couple months and then started taking Clomid again.  I have been on 100mg of Clomid on days 3-8 of my cycle and am in the middle of my 5th cycle on Clomid and Metformin combined (this time around).  I have been successfully ovulating for 4 months with this combo, but so far am not pregnant.  I have experienced severe nausea and diareaha from the Metformin, but found that taking two Immodium AD pills every night when I take the Metformin helps that significantly.  I have been experiencing nausea, dizziness, cramps, nipple soreness, anxiety, severe depression, and hot flashes on the Clomid.  If I can get pregnant it will be worth it, but I hope it happens soon because I really hate taking the Clomid.",4,4,4

I've been taking this medication for almost two weeks now. I started taking it one at night for a week which really worked and I had no side effects. Well I lost 8.9 pounds with the help of Atkins which I was already on before I started taking the medication. I am in my second week in which I upped the dosage to one in the morning and one at night. With the one in the morning I feel sick to my stomach all the time except for when I am sleeping which seems to be all the time. So I think I will just do two at night and hopefully that does the same for me because this one in the morning just throws my body for a loop. I have occasional upset stomach but not enough to interfere with my normal routine like the nausea. Hopefully if I take two pills at night I can stop with that and live normal. The weight that was lost was an extra benefit I can’t complain about that because I needed help in that area. ,3,3,4

I am taking in combination with aygestin to regulate periods and increase fertility. i have always taken a multivitamin with it, so that could be the reason i'm having no side effects.",5,3,3

"I didn't know that I had PCOS for almost ten years, I just thought that the extra hair, acne and mood swings were apart of life. As soon as a found out what was wrong with me I read up on PCOS and thought although Metformin has it side effects that it would be the best road for me to take. So far so good! I have been taking it for almost three weeks and just got my period, 31 day after my last...that has NEVER happend. I feel good I have more energy, my acne is going away (not as fast as I would like it to) I am not as moody and my doctor said the hair issue will change over time.

If I take 2 in the evening, it gives me severe and uncontrollable diarrhea, so I stopped taking the 2 together (1000 mg). I itch and I'm tired and I wonder if it's the drug. I do take other drugs for cholesterol, bp and triglycerides, so who can tell what is the culprit...probably all of them. Getting older and sicker is a constant battle and not pleasant.

"I have been taking 2000mg of Metformin a day for a couple of weeks to treat PCOS. Have had the side effects of constant bathroom visits for upset stomach. I experience nausea and fatigue, but have lost 20 lbs!! I have struggled with my weight all of my life so seeing some results is well worth it. I always have pepto, immoudium and tums on hand at all times. I will continue to fight the bad bc weight loss is well worth it!!!!",3,4,5

Then another one one June 21st-09 and I haven't stopped since I started taking the metformin. My cycles have been going from light to heavy.

"Too early to tell but there are some good signs. Wierd, I have no anxiety which I assumed was from my IBS and the social embarrasment of being sick all the time. Side effects are tolerable and got better in two days then after upping the dose got better again. Lost 4 pounds in 5 days doing nothing and my belly is a teeny bit flatter. I am taking with Spironolactone and my IBS meds and am waiting for more good results. Remember it takes time!",5,4,4
"I was DXed with PCOS in 1999, I was put on Metiformin as an at-the-time non standard treatment.  Before starting to take it, I would have a period maybe every 100+ days.  very very irregular, after a couple years of monitoring and adjusting of dosage, i am on 1500 mg daily of the extended release.  I have lost and gained and lost 30 lbs over the last 10 years.  My avrage cycle for the span of jan 2007 to Dec 2008 was 40 days.  Still not pregnant, but we've stopped trying for that, and just trying for the health of my body, to keep Type 2 out of my life.  Over the years I have found that taking the pills with food helps, and taking it with milk (cerial or just a glass of milk) is best.  I can not drink alchol while on it, causes diareia.  Cutting back on fried foods and carbs also helps with the gas and diarehha. When I stick to whole grains, milk and fresh fruit and veggies with small servings of meat, I almost have no side effects, and feel a lot better.  I also found taking a multi vit or atleast a B complex 4 hours apart from taking the Met helps with the energy.   For those that are new to the drug, if you've been put on 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg, try starting out taking just 500 for a week or 2, then 1000 for a week or two then so forth, letting your body get used to the meds in small stepps, it helps.  Also, it can take 2-6 months for your body to fully get used to it.  it may be uncomrfortable in the mean time, but don't give up!  Pepto and tums will be your friend for a while :) If after a few months its still bad, and you are NOT on the extended release pills, ask to swich,  the side effects are much better.",5,5,5
"I am 19, and just married, I found out in May 09 that I have PCOS, iv been put on Metformin and Yaz, since then Iv lost about 10 lbs and I am not hurting nearly as much. My doctor is still unsure about my chances of getting pregnant, but the Metformin has helped me alot. ",4,4,4

I ran out of meds for 3 days and surprisingly I felt a lot better! I don't think this med is helping. In fact I think it is keeping my numbers higher than what they would be by diet alone. May try not taking it for a week or two and see what my numbers are.",3,2,1
"I have had some problems (mainly because I can't get a fixed meal schedule-I'm too busy), and I haven't had another check up to see if it's helping-but I have 2 questions.   How long should it be between doses? Is tehre a too soon time? I take 3 a day (so with meals) but sometimes the length of time between them varies....  I've had two bottles, and just got my third but for some reason the pills smell fishy, which I didn't notice with the other two previous. Should I be worried?",3,3,3
"I have only taken it for about a week.  I don't really know how it is affecting me, I am more tired.  ",3,3,3
I found out in Jan. 2009 that I had PCOS. My doctor put me on this medicine. I quickly found that I needed to eat before taking the pills. Then I lost my appitite. If I take the pills with out eating i get very sick. If I dont eat enough I get very sick. My periods are still very irregular. I can skip a few months then bleed nonstop for weeks.

"I am so glad to read that others have experienced side effects with this drug. I thought I was losing my mind. The cramping and diariah (sp?) are a definite nuisance. I have been on it for 6 weeks. Started w/500mg 2x/day. Now, 1000mg 2x/day. I have Metabolic Syndrome and need to correct it before it becomes pre-diabetes. Also, low thyroid. In the beginning, I was very tired, had muscle aches, loss of appetite, and headaches in addition to the diariah. The headaches are gone as are the muscles aches after 6 weeks. The bathroom episodes are now every 3 days-ish. I need to take this to get healthy. Period. So if the bathroom episodes aren't every day, I will continue to take this. In the 6 weeks, I have lost 21 lbs. Making healthy food choices is so much easier too. With everything in life, there are pluses and minuses. ",5,5,5
can one of the side effects be itching......,1,1,1
Been working fairly well for me.  I could do a bit better with my eating habits but Metformin helping keep blood sugar under control.  I am having some neuropothy type symptoms in my right hand and right foot but that may be due to a possible B vitamin deficiency (metformin may be cause of of the low B) along with reduced circulation from licinopril and simvastatin.  Be sure you watch your B levels in your periodic testing.  Overall metformin has been pretty good tho in helping regulate my sugar.  ,5,4,4

Both my GP and G.I. docs have taken me off of the med.  I am still constipated and have stool in my large intestines that will not pass.

"Metformin caused lactic acidosis. This medication did work for my mother without remarkable symptoms for several years. Then symptoms began to gradually appear and her medical management team overlooked them: increased tiredness and sleepiness during the day, loss of muscle strength in legs, shortness of breath (increasing), stomach upset...fainting. She was hospitalized twice which required stopping the metformin and getting nasal Oxygen. She became Remarkably More Alert and less tired both time. Doctors did not think symptoms were related to metformin and ruled out cardiac problems. She continued the metformin until she developed low blood pressure and the shortness of breath became Kushmall breathing, deep labored breathing because her body was not able to use oxygen that she had in her blood and she died. She basically suffocated to death. It was horrible watching her die. ------Be very careful if you take this drug. Remember your kidneys rid you of this drug and if they are not working properly you basically are increasing the dosage in your body and putting you at greater risk for lactic acidosis symptoms. Watch out for yourself because the medical folks don't always come through for you and yours!  ",5,1,3

I have been on 500mg a day for about a week. I am suppose to be taking 500 mg 2 times per day. I too have experienced cramping & diarrhea.  I suppose it is too soon to expect sugarlevels to drop but it would be nice to lose some weight also.  I think I will give it a few more weeks.,5,1,3
was on metformin and byetta - after 4 months had to stop the byetta but kept on with the metformin - getting off the byetta was good - i was getting worse daily - been off the byetta over two months - still am very very tired and seem to not be able to taste things - at least not as i once did - i eat and my stomach growls - and i am really not hungry - is the metformin the one making me tired and not myself at all - i wonder about it - when i was so bad with the byetta i am wondering if it was the two that caused it ,3,3,3

I DEVELOP SEVERE DIARRHEA WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION ALMOST TO THE POINT OF DEHYDRATION.  EVEN TRYED TO TAKE IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH IEVEN TRYED THE EXTENDED RELEASE TYPE BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO ME.

"I take this for PCOS - I am not diabetic, or prediabetic. I wish more health care professionals knew this, because they always talk about my sugar, or suggest pricking my finger - things I don't need to worry about. I started taking most of my meds at 14, when they found out I had PCOS. A lot of the time, I'd forget for months to take my pills. Metformin/Glucophage didn't exactly act as encouragement. The first week or two taking the medication, I had diarrhea, and stomach cramps. But they went away a little. At the time, I was at 2000mg per day; but since my diarrhea hadn't improved so much, I was reduced to a daily, nighttime dose of only 1000. It took me a couple of times to stick to the meds, and take them daily. They didn't help my appetite too much, but now they don't really bother me.",4,5,4
it even helped me loose the belly fat.,5,5,5
i started taking this medicine for about a month now. i finially got my period which i haven't had for 6 months. but the cramps are painful. the sideeffects was not bad. i had diarrea for only 1 day and i was tired for 3 days. i feel amazing now. me and my husband has been trying to have a baby for 2 years and the reviews i've read is getting me very happy. i hope i get pregnant really soon!!!! email me and tell me how soon you all go pregnant.

Never have I been able to accomplish such a feat. I have more energy and am less hungry and when I do slip up an eat too much ice cream before bed - I STILL LOSE WEIGHT. i'm in love with this drug. where have you been all my life?! the side effects (gas, loose stool) have been present since day 1 but they have become less bothersome. I'll take ""bubbles in my tummy"" in exchange for a helping hand in weight loss any day! =) We're also hoping this medication will make it easier & safer for us to have a baby this year.

Due to high readings I continued taking it because my readings were low, and I felt a difference in energy. After 1 week I couldn't the itching anymore, talked with my doc they gave me glipzide.  Low readings, but no energy and bad headaches, and leg cramps. Went back on Metformin, this is day two and NO itching, energy level gaining, and hopefully weight loss is in the future as well.  Very strange that I have no itching this time around, as at the time of the itching nothing had changed in my routine for the itching to have started, no detergent, lotion, soap, shampoo etc changes, the Metformin was the only thing new to my body?",3,3,5
"When my dr. increased my dosage at night from 500 to 1000 mg, in the middle of the night I would have to literally run to the bathroom with diarrhea. When I cut my dosage back to 500 mg, it did not happen again.",3,2,3

After taking this for approx 2 weeks, I felt better, more energy. My blood sugars have since come down and currently average around 100. I also take cinnamon capsules each day. My diet is very low in carbs and sugars. I have lost approx 20 pounds since January. My only concern, is I don't want to continue to lose more weight. ",4,4,4
"I am on a pain mgmnt regimine. I had a 5 hr glucose tolerance test. Low and behold this test proved that I am not a diabetic.

With this drug, I have experienced fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, head aches, muscle pains and the list goes on... The only reason I'm taking it now, is because I always finish my medication that is prescribed to me, and I don't have that much left to go. On a good note, I don't eat anywhere near as much as I used to, which is a good thing, considering I'm overweight.",5,2,2
Have been taking this medication for one and half years. Blood sugar is in control but has experienced weight gain. I eat healthier and exercise almost two hours a day but still gain weight. Almost 25lbs. Worry that the weight gain will someday raise blood sugars. Told Dr but he said that I should be losing weight. Feel totally frustrated but will keep exercising. Would hate to think what the weight gain would be in not exercising. I think that if there was weight lose it would be better for the blood sugars. Uphill battle.,5,3,5

Now I am left with unsteady blood sugar levels, and I'm not overweight and I exercise (run 10 miles/week). And I still have the PCOS of course. Wishing I would have quit taking it after the first month but was dumb/desperate enough to think that it would take time to kick into effect - duh- it DID take effect - a BAD effect. I'm glad it does work for many people. Good Luck to you all!",5,1,1

And the sugar situation seems just getting worse. My usual reading in the morning above 170 and before bed roller coaster between 103 to 155. One day,after I walked a 5K fun run, my reading was 304. After one hour water exersice, the reading was 254. Those number sent me to despair. Feel so trapped in this dark blue depression. What gone wrong? I feel trapped in this dark blue depreesion",5,2,1

MY EYES AND MOUTH ITCHED AFTER TAKING THIS MEDICINE . HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS REACTION ? IS THIS COMMON?,2,2,4
I started taking metformin for PCOS. I started with 1 a day for a week and then 2 and then 3. I did get sick to my stomach and I also did have diahrea. I took it for almost two months. I then started taking clomid and ovidrel to help me ovulate. I just found out yesterday that I am pregnant. This medicine really helped. The outcome is much better than the side effects.,3,5,5

Started taking 500mg of extended release Metformin, and got a period soon after. I'm not experiencing any diarrhea, and I get full easily when I eat. I take it at night before I go to sleep on an empty stomach with no problems. My MD said that if I continue to get my period on this dose, he will keep me at 500mg. If I don't, we'll increase 500mg slowly. So far, so good!",5,5,4
I was recently diagnosed with PCOS.  Started taking Metformin a month ago and have extreme diarrhea and stomach cramps really bad.  I'm overweight and diet and exercise and have not seen any significant weight loss as of yet.  Not sure how is it is helping with my high testosterone. I go back to the doctor next week...hopefully the medicine is helping.  That's more important than loosing the weight..i'll just keep being diligent in this fight for weight loss.,3,2,2
muscle and joint pain,5,3,2
"I found out that I had Diabetes about 5yrs.ago and I was put on metformin and I am very glad. It doesnt make me sick, even if I take it on an empty stomach. I would recommend metformin to anyone that does not have to have insulin.",5,5,5
I just began taking Metformin Oral 500 ml w/ my evening meal.  In the a.m. I experience stomach cramps and diarrhea.  Gets better as the day goes on.  Is this a common side effect until the body gets adjusted to the medication?,5,3,4
"I was on Metformin 500mg Extended Release for 2 weeks. During that time I got more and more tired each day and didn't see my blood sugar levels drop enough to make it worth while to continue. My doctor put me on the Metformin Regular. That was worse. By the second day, after 2 doses, I was so tired I could hardly function, my heart felt like it was racing and I felt horrible. I've been off for 6 days and my heart still feels like it's racing sometimes. May try Januvia next.",4,1,2

We are both pleased with the results of Metformin. I'm sure if my doctor knew of any warnings of this medication ,She would have had me stop taking it immediately. ",5,4,5
"I actually have polycystic ovarian syndrome & type II diabetes. I am taking 1000mg in the morning and 1000mg at night.

But I gained all my weight plus back and have not been able to pregnant. In my late twenties I learned about PCOS and talked to my doctor. I had to convince him of what I had, because he took so long I now have high cholesterol, high BP, facial hair, and Type 2 diabetes. I have lost weight and have a period but it is not ""normal"" yet. Metformin helped with my blood sugars and yes I suffered harsh side effects but I found that taking an Immodium AD pill with it helped tremendously. Because of the severe diarrhea I did not get constipated from the Immodium and was able to live without too much worry. Now I just hope I can have one more baby.",3,3,3
"This treatment has worked for me and is affordable also. I take 1 at breakfast, and 2 at bedtime. Also use humalog /mix75/25 mornings and supper time. This is a perfect combination for me.",5,5,5
"so far I have been on it for 8 days, I don't like it much.",4,3,3
I used to feel miserable before taking this pill.  I now take 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening. I no longer have dry cracked feet and my sugar level has dropped from the mid 300's to the mid 100's.  All is better except that now I struggle with daily diahria and cramps. I also get migranes now but not sure if its related to this.,3,3,3
"Even though when you first start this drug, you will have runny stools, it is effective in keeping my blood sugars low.",5,5,5
"i was diagnosed with PCOS, which apparently i got from a sudden rapid weight gain?? Anyways, I gained 80 lbs in a year and my doctor says this triggered this isulin issue and thats why i can't loose weight. This Metformin I take 1,500Mg a day. One in the morning and 2 at night, I have yet to notice any change in me and the minor side effects I have had are Consitpation and extreame fatigue.

hungrier between meals..feeling of dizziness or low blood sugar..fatigue,3,3,3
"Although most typically prescribed to help women with PCOS get pregnant, if you are not trying to get pregnant right now and you are having side effects - here is my suggesion. (I have a lot of experience both as a patient and a friend to a variety of healthcare providers.)Start at a lower dosage (500mg) and work up to higher dosages. Also, adding a birth control method (ie: nuevaring or a pill) can help regulate your periods. The combination of both is far more effective. I'm already a lot better after a short period of time. I've seen it work both ways - but combining drugs seems to help the most. ",4,4,4
Seems to work very well for me.,5,5,5
oN THIS MEDICATIO FOR 3 MONTHS AND THEN I GOT PREAGNANT.  STILL ON MEDICATION ,5,4,4

"I was diagnosed with PCOS, my doctor put me on metformin for my cysts.  I have IBS and this drug made it much worse.  I was on 1000mg and had severe muscle pain so my doctor put me on 500mg and I still had the same stomach issue.  He then put me on glumetza and I am much better.  If you have stomach problems with this drug I would talk to your doctor about glumetza it is time released and for people that stomach is a mess from metformin this is a dream.  I am hoping that we can get pregnant with this. ",3,1,2

"I just found out that I have PCOS. And to make it better i have tumors on my ovaries to. Oh by the way im 18 yrs old and i just moved out on my own and dont have insurance any more. Its scary but i am thankful that its not the worst news i could have recieved. I just started taking the Metformin and all i can say is these side effects are terrible, but im going to stick in there and try to get past it, ill let everyone know how it goes....",3,3,3
"I was diagnosed with PSOS last month, I have been taking metformin for 2weeks. Major stomach side effects. Trying to get pregnant, so I will stick with it.",1,2,2
I just started on Metformin. I have not had very many bad symptoms. It is helping my pain and lowering my blood sugars. I think it is great I take 1000 mg per day. Be sure to take it with a meal or after a meal of you will get sick,4,4,4
"I was on Met for 2 months before finally getting pregnant (after 2 years of trying), and then for my first trimester. I had none of the common stomach issues, but I eased into my 1000/day dose very very gradually, which I believe helped. I highly recommend this for women with PCOS.",5,5,5
So this medication Metformin is helping.,5,4,4
"Have been on this for 8 years and am now having tremors of hands and loss of balance.  Parkinson's has been ruled out.  Hair starting to fall out, as well. It does help with glucose level if you exercise and diet, as well.   Anybody else having these  problems?  thanks.",5,3,3
I've had several side effects but they only last a few weeks.,4,4,4
"I've been on this for 2 months now, holding strong at 1000mg. I've had little to no side effects and I have dropped 3 jean sizes. We'll be upping my dosage again soon.",5,5,5
I have tolerated this medication well and have been able to keep my sugar under control and it has also helped me to keep my weight down.,4,5,5
"Recently I found a strange something in my stool that was round but rectangular, and nothing like anything I had eaten.

"I have type 2 diabetes.  I started 2 weeks ago with 500mg per day and am now up to 500 2x a day.  I plan on taking 2000 total.

I assume I have lost weight, but haven't weighed myself yet.  I think it's great so far!",5,5,4
"Started taking 500mg just under a week ago. Five days in, I have a metallic taste and smell any time I come near a cigarette, I've been a smoker for ten years. Never smelled an odor as repulsive as this. Eyes get dry from time to time. Face and nose have mild itch. Do feel more energized than before taking the drug. Haven't had serious stool problems, occasional urge to go though. Only complaint is the heavy metallic cigarette smell/ flavor. ",5,3,4
Have taken 1000mg each morning and 500mg each night since August '08.  Weight loss has stablized.  Blood sugar levels are maintained at or below 100.  A1C is now 5.1% instead of 11.4%.  I would say it works!,5,5,5

"I am on my 4th week taking this drug for PCOS.  I started at 1x/daily and worked my way to 4x/daily at 2000 mg.  I have not had any major side effects.  I had one day of nausea and a few days where I felt exhausted, but otherwise I seem to have evaded the other unpleasant side effects.  I'm eating a healthier diet and working on getting motivated to exercise a bit more.  I've lost 5 lbs. in 2 weeks and hoping to lose more weight in the next few months.  So far so good.",5,5,5
"With this medication, I not only have my diabetes under control, I also have lost weight. This, along with the medication, has my diabetes under control.",4,4,4
I have been on this medication for 5 years. It does good about my diabetes but the side effects with a rash and diarrhea somtimes gets to be annoying. I think that I would feel better about it if I did not have to take the deneric in it.,5,2,3

I take 500mg. before bed and am planning to increase dosage next month. It's cleared up my acne a lot! I feel a lot of muscle pain, weakness and fatigue, plus I've been crying a lot, but I don't know what else to do to treat this. It's a tough situation.",2,4,4

In the beginning a little nausea but now that has completely gone away.  The only thing I seem to deal with now are the symptons of a Urinary tract infection and I think that might be because I am not drinking enough fluids. I thought I read somewhere to drink plenty of fluids when taking metformin. But overall I am really pleased with the way my sugar counts have dropped. ",5,5,5
been using metformin (500 mg) for over 2 years for Type 2 diabetes -  1 in a.m. and 1 in p.m. - has kept my blood sugar average until Christmas and I have not been able to bring it down - lowest now is 153.  My doctor upped the dosage to 2 in a.m. and 2 in p.m. today.  I started taking 2 tonight and I feel very lightheaded.  Is this normal?  My heart beat was very fast for a  few minutes.   ,5,5,5
"I have only been on this medication for 2 weeks, so have not yet seen/felt all the benefits. I had dirreha the first week on the meds, but I feel that it is worth it. I am begining to feel more energy, and less hungry. How long does it take to see and feel all the results? The only thing that is hard to get used to is my blood sugar getting low when it's time to eat. I get hungry very quickly, and I get cranky. SO I've been carrying small snacks with me to try to prevent the crankiness. Drink LOTS of water too. Over all, I don't mind being on this medication.",5,3,3
Ihave diarrea all the time my stomach gets upset and i am nauseas I have thrown up once my muscles in my stomach hurt I feel like I need to urinate constantly which is hard on me because I have an overactive bladder anyway and I have been constipated bu8t on a more positive note I have lost weight and my sugar isn't as elevated. and I have concern because at this time I am having to get xrays by a urologist because I have a mass on my right kidney that has to be monitored,1,2,2
"I have diarrhea everyday when taking metformin, and have begun being nauseated as well.  ",5,2,2
"This medicine has really helped me.  I take 2,000 mgs. a day. My goal is to have my Dr. lower the mgs.",4,4,4

"I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes just three weeks ago, in early December 2008. (I self-diagnosed it with urine test-strip, and the doctor confirmed it.) My glucose and A1C levels were through the roof...A1C was 12.9. (That is not a typo...it was 12.9!) Blood sugar was over 300. Scarey stuff, as I should have been in a coma. Instead, I had no symtoms except for losing weight and frequent urination. I immediately had a massive change in diet, and started walking 4-8 miles a day. My doctor started my on the Metformin with two 500 mg tabs a day, taken at dinner. I have seen my blood glucose readings drop from 270 down to 90 within the past two weeks. I've dropped 44 pounds, (the last 15-20 have been from the diet and exercise), and even my blood pressure haas fallen 20 points. I have experience no side effects at all from the Metformin. None. No diarrhea, no nausea, no feeling of being tired...nothing. So I guess you could say that I love the stuff. I don't know how far my A1C readings have fallen yet, as I haven't had that retested yet. But imagine that they are well on their way to coming into the tolerance range. In addition to good food (no sugar, lots of veggies, lean meats, whole grains, a few almonds for snacking, etc.), my doctor also recommended that I use the Adkins products to supplement my diet when needed. I find the ""treats"" such as the low-carb desserts are an acceptable way to satisfy my cravings when the sweet tooth calls.  BTW, I had no one to blame but myself for the onset of the diabetes. I was a competitive powerlifter for 20 years, and was 5'-10"", 326 pounds! That's just plain dumb. I want to get back down to 170, but I've got another 100 to go. I figure it'll take me a bit over a year, but I am determined!",5,5,5
"I cannot eat any veggies,fruits or whole grains on these meds. I have horrible diarrhea with it. My doctor is not convinced this true and doesn't listen to anything I say so I am stuck with this med.",5,2,3
"I my self like the treatment, it does help but no matter what I do mt blood sugar still goes up and down. My doctor thinks it is doing it's job but I'm not real sure about it.",5,5,4
"I was dx with PCOS in May of 2008. I started on metformin extended release 500mg once a day for the 1st month and then up to twice a day the 2nd month and three times a day on the 3rd month. I was very nauseated at first but I just stuck with it and it subsided after about 3 weeks. I had a drastic reduction in the dark hairs on my upper lip and sides of my face. I did experience extreme fatigue. I read online that metformin can block b vitamins from being absorbed from your food and drink causing you to become tired so I started eating ""b-dots"" a form of vitamin b that absorbs under the tongue and now I feel like my energy is back. I would recommend taking bdots if you feel tired on metformin, it really worked for me. It's worth a try and it wont hurt b vitamins are water soluable so what your body does not use you dispose of through urine. Hope this helps someone.",3,4,4
my diet and exercise works better I would rather miss my a1c target a small % and feel healthy than feel bad all the time due to the side effects of this medication.,5,1,1
"a doctor at the VA in San Antonio Tx, raised my dosage from 500mg twice a day to 1000mg twice a day. I started having extreme pains in my lower legs at night, especially my ankle area, also had chest pains in the am.  I quit taking the high dose and all the symptons went away.",4,1,4
"Was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in March of '08; started out w/3 tabs a day for 3 wks; then down to 2. Stopped eating refined sugar, switched to whole grain products. Sugar level average dropped from 125 to 95 & AC1 dropped from 7.2 to 6.0 after 3 mos. of usage. Now, 8 mos, have maintained almost normal sugar levels & so far have dropped 67 lbs. I have more energy than ever before & being obese for years, the ongoing weight loss is a great motivator to keep going with the diet & exercise program.  At 55 yrs of age, I consider the diagnosis a blessing and not a curse!!",5,5,5
While on this medicine...it made me feel like I needed to vomit. I was very tired and just wanted to sleep...just could not function...did not feel great at all...would not recommend to anyone...blood sugars ran high while on this medicine.,1,1,1
"I have been on this medication for about 7 months now for a condition called Insulin Resistance. I started on a low dose, 500mg a day and my levels went up from 17 - 24. Then she put me on a little more.Now up to 1000 mg a day. I go back 3 months later and my insulin levels went down form 24-21 and she insreased it again.... Now I take 1500 mg a day.

"I was diagnosed with PCOS in Aug 08. I was only have a period over 60 days and they would last 10-16 days, with horrible cramps and heavy bleeding.  I did not realize I had any problems until I went off my birth control to try to get pregnant.  I gain 40lbs in 3 months, started growing hair, and had rage issues.  After being diagnosed, I was put on Metformin.  I have not been taking properly due to the horrible diarreah I have.  No nausea, just horrilbe diareah, like 3-6 times a day.  Causes issues at work. Also had probles with being extremly tired.  So tired I sometimes can not get up out of bed.  Good things are that even with not taking properly I am having regular periods now, and they only last about 7 days, with only about 3 being heavy bleeding days.  I am trying to be strong with the diarreah and take it properly so I can increas the dosage.  Hoping to loose some weight and get pregnant! ",2,3,3
I was diagnosed with Type  in 7/08.  My A1C was 9.3 and my glucose 293.  I take 500mg 2times a day.  Along with proper diet my A1C has dropped to 5.1 and my glucose has been generally in the 80's.  I have also gone from 248 to 199lbs in the past 12 mos.  The only problem I'm experiencing is I've gone from a twice a day bathroom man to an every other day.  This has caused some constipation and cramping at times.  I may not be eating enough!  Overall I'm happy with the results.,5,5,5
i have been on the glucophage for almost 5 years.  I was on it 2 times a day at 1000 mg each time along with the glipizide and that kept my sugars in the hypoglycemic range where i could not get my glucose levels to raise and stay within my range and i was hospitalized and then they decreased it to 500mg twice a day.  So far it is working really well.,4,3,4

"Taking 1000mg twice daily. No side effects. Have lowered blood sugar level now checking 90 or less every morning. Most likely due to 35units of Lantus at night and diet, exercise more than the drug itself. The jury is still out for me as to whether it is helping or not.",4,2,2

"Since I my symptoms for diabetes were non existing other than the elevated fasting sugar blood levels, I have neither felt a good or bad result. But I can say that I do feel more energized after my meals.

i take it for insulin resistance. to all those who get sick. do not take it on an empty stomach! give your food about 15 min. to get in your system then take it. make sure you drink plenty of water because it will make you urinate more often because it is releasing the sugar in your body. hope this was helpful ,5,3,5

Long term useage patients experiencing renal insufficency,3,1,3
I have been taking metformin for a little over a year now. This is an intense drug that is very very difficult to take at first. I am now up to 2000mg/day to treat my PCOS and I have lost 15 lbs. It was absolutely brutal at first. I was vomitting and having diarrhea every day for a long time. I just kept trying though and I eventually got myself acclimated to the full dosage. It was hard but I feel it was worth it now. ,1,4,4
"I have Type 2 diabetes that was under control before I started taking this med.  I am not overweight, but I began to GAIN weight when I took this with my birthcontrol!  I had symptoms when I first started taking this, but they went away after about the first week.  But, I couldn't move up to 1000mg because it gave my severe diarrhea.  I took it for about 4 months and began having severe abdominal cramping, IBS, and severe nausea after taking the meds. I got it and immediately felt better. This pill is not for everyone! It affects some people worse than others!",4,2,3

I'm to take 250 mg once a day for a week, then 500 once a day for a week,then 500 twice a day.  I can hardly wait for that!  I should mention that I also have irritable bowel syndrome, which I made sure I told my doctor about before he prescribed this med.  Surely there MUST be something else I can take.",1,1,1

I been on this drug for 2 months. I was in the borderline range and I said ok I'll try this drug. I asked whether I would be on this drug for life and was told no that once I got my numbers down I could stop taking it. I was never told that I couldn't have a few beers a day. Well I thought I was ok until I started testing my blood a few days before my Drs appointment and was I SHOCKED. I never had numbers that high...294..281...274. I couldn't believe it! Before I took this pill I would have a few beers at the end of the day and I was Type 2 now I'm afraid I may have really done some long term damage.

Cardiac exams (stress test and cardiac cath ruled out heart problem). With the last fainting and emergercy room visit, they decide it might be related to the metformin and have stopped it. It has been two days and she reports feeling so much better, more awake. Now she just needs to get over all the pain/bruising from the fall with fainting. I wish her doctors would have considered the metformin the problem long ago. I hate to think that this drug may have encouraged kidney problems. She also had begun to retain fluid even though has been on diuretics. Folks be careful if take this drug long term. ",4,1,2

"For years I've had problems with irregular cycles and weight gain not knowing this was a actual disorder. I was diagnosed with pcos in July of this year. My doctor prescribed me Metformin 500mg to take 2x a day for the 1st month and then 3x day the 2nd month. I admit I was nervous from reading some of the bad reviews. Well, this is my second month and I really can tell this drug is working.  Most of all it has regulated my cycles and it has helped me to loose some weight as well. I now have more energy than before and also it has helped with acne and facial hair due to having pcos. The only downside or side effect I have is sometimes I have stomach aches accompanied by diarrhea when eating greasy foods. I was told by a nurse the use of Immodium helps while taking this drug when upset stomach and diarrhea occurs which has helped me. So far I haven't  had any other complaints or problems with this drug. I plan to contine using this drug and hopefully it will help my infertility issues caused by pcos so I can become a proud mother someday...",4,5,4

With PCOS, you have alot of testosterone and so you have a lot of hair and most of your weight goes to your stomach and as a teenage girl that is definately not attractive and it really bothered me. now that im on metphormin, my hair doesnt grow as much on my legs and underarms and my testosterone levels have decreased to the normal level. i do have occasional ruts with metphormin i do have to admit. i occasionally get nausea and diarrhea and stomach aches that really bother me but they go away within like a week. metphormin has also helped regulate my periods, metphormin has made my life alot easier!

I cam eto this website to research the drug and I will say, I was quite nervous about using the drug from the reviews posted. I will say, I started out with a low dose and increases it to 3 times a day. Within a week, my body felt better. I was not as tired or run down as before. I actually wanted to do things after work instead of coming home and taking a nap. I did experience some side affects like diahera, right after I would take the medicine.

I had quit taken my Metformin, after having our first baby, I hadn't exercised and weighed quite a bit More than before. I miscarried.

Taking met after a meal has been helpful. The diarrhea has been occassional. I look forward to these side effects easing up.The first few days were  the worst.

I am going on my 4th week of taking it and I feel better than I have in years!  I hope it will continue to give way so I can lose some weight . . . I haven't been gaining & thats a plus.

Same song and dance - anovulation, very rare periods, depression, quick-to-anger (overproduction of androgens, underproduction of other hormones)  Metformin was prescribed after blood work and other tests, and I've been taking it for approximately 3 months.  Now that my hormone levels are leveling out correctly and periods are normal, the downside is that I do have HORRIBLE periods.  So much pain that it feels like a miscarriage.  Time to revisit the Dr.  I feel a lot better, lost weight, metabolism has increased, and fatigue and depression has disapated.  Unfortunately, I have to get the laser hair removal to cure the lip and chin hair that was created through the over produced androgens from the hormone imbalance!  Anybody else out there with the same problem??  For those feeling the depression - you need to see your Dr. again because the metformin does not cause that - there is something else wrong.  Depression is from your unbalanced hormone levels.  I know there are two dosage levels, and you may need yours increased...check with your Dr. to make sure it's not in fact the hormone levels.  A Simple blood work follow up with your Dr. will tell.  I'm finding this condition is much more common - I just happen to be one of the unlucky one's with you to deal with it!",5,4,5

"Hi, I like most women taking this medicaton was diagnosed with PSOS. I am 34yrs old and have never started my period w/o any type of medication (birth control, provera, etc.). I always felt ""not normal"" in highschool or any time after that. All the girl were talking about starting their periods and I never did. As an adult I never started which ment I couldn't have children. My husband and I went to see my doctor and he put me on ferilization pills. I was one of the lucky ones, I got pregnant the first series. Everyone always told me that once I had a baby that my body would straighten itself out. Well, dont belive them because even after I had my daughter my body went back to doing nothing. No periods. Even fertilization pills dont work now. I have tried at least 10 times in the past 9 years and each time failed. My doctor put me on Metformin for the first time 2 months ago. I had my first period 4 days ago. I was so suprised. Who would had thought sugar pills would make you start your period. It wasn't painful like with birth control. Just a little ache here and there but nothing I can't handle. Now I am just waiting to see if I can get pregnant. I am very confident, reading the other reviews helps keep me positive and I hope that reading mine will help some body else.

Back then, as soon as you were pregnant, they made you get off Metformin. After my daughter's birth, my periods were normal so I didn't take the medicine anymore. 2 years later, I wanted another baby and got back on Metformin and 2 months later I took another positive pregnancy test!

"I've been on Metformin for about a month for PCOS. If you are like me and have rarely any side effects from medication you are in for a surprise!  As soon as I started taking these pills I had nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite to my favorite foods and depression! I seriously am a different person while taking these pills.  I would start my day off with a small breakfast (cereal, fruit, and a bagel), take my pills, and go to work. I tried to be tough and tolerate my symptoms but I couldn't.  I really had a hard time at work because it made me so lethargic! I also had nausea and FREQUENT trips to the bathroom! If only we could get frequent flyer miles for our trips to the bathroom.  Just the thought of taking the pills now makes me feel sick. What I have learned is to not take the pills in the morning; continue to have a small breakfast but wait until you have lunch to take your pills.  This will minimize the nausea and diarrhea while you are at work.  Thereafter, take the final two after dinner. After I take my pills I have been drinking any type of thick, cold drink to settle my stomach.  I recommend a milkshake, smoothie or a green tea frappuccino from Starbuks.  For some reason, having this drink helps minimize my nausea.   My doctor also recommend I continue to work out while on these pills.   With all the nausea and diarrhea symptoms, who can work out??  Not me... I recommend working out first thing in the morning before you've taken this medication. Hopefully, I won't have to be on these pills for too long...   Also, don't forget to take some baby wipes with you to work!  You'll thank me later!  Good luck Ladies!",2,1,3

I started taking this drug to treat my PCOS b/c I was on my cycle for 3 months straight. My endocrinologist Doctor put me on it for twice a day and I had severe nausea on it and lost 30 pounds which I wasn't happy about b/c I lost it quickly. I was only taking it twice a day for a month and half before he took me off it and put me back on it once a day. I'm doing much better on it once a day. Pick up 5 pounds so now I can maintain my weight. Now I'm just hoping I can get pregnant on it b/c just like everyone else I was told I can't have children having PCOS. It's only been a couple of months since I been back on this drug for once a day. So time will tell. I do recommend this drug for anyone who has problems with the cycle b/c I been having problems since the age of 12 now 25 and just now getting proper treatment.,4,5,4

I began taking Metformin when I was 17 (now 19) for PCOS. I had been told I would not be able to have children and was devastated. When I was 18 I switched to Fortamet because of the nausea but aside from that had no problems on Metformin. After not being consistent with birth-control and losing about 25 pounds  I became pregnant with my beautiful son. He's almost 15 months now and after gaining a lot of weight and being on my period for 5 months straight I'm happy to say that I'll be starting Metformin again soon... after I've completed a month of birth control... because now like normal women I can worry about getting pregnant! Amazing! I'm completely confident that Metformin will help me regain normalcy in my menstrual cycle and help me lose the weight I've been putting on. And I look forward to (once my husband's ready) being able to try for another baby! Metformin is my miracle drug. Plus it's only 4 dollars at Wal-mart.,5,5,5

I am type 1 diabetic, I have a kidney disease, and I have fibromyalgia. I got two opinions, thousands of dollars in blood work and medical testing. The second doctor told me that I must be depressed and should start on depression medication right away, which I declined. Recently I ran out of the metformin, and I didn't fill it right away. I started to feel better. 3 days off of it now, my tired feeling is improving a little more each day, the gas is still present, the terrible aches are gone. The nausea is gone.The headaches are still present but not persisting. Over all every day I feel better when I am NOT taking this drug. My father has taken this medication for 5 years and had no problem. A dear friend took this medication for 4 years with no problem. I took it for two months and was worried I was dying it made me feel so bad and they could find NOTHING on the blood work or scans. Be weary of this drug.

My insurance co made me switch to this after many years of taking Januvia. My blood sugar on Nesina is as high as it has ever been. I have switched back to Januvia at my own expense while my Dr. and I do battle with my insurance carrier.,1,1,1
"This medications has worked like a charm for me, I take it along with a low dose of Amaryl, each once a day (Amaryl mornings & Nesina at night). It has lower my A1C level from a 7.3 to 5.9 in 3 months!",5,5,5
"Only been using 1 week but sugars are down.  downside gas and mild constipation, hopefully this will subside.",5,4,4
poor blood sugar control,3,1,3
"Along with most reviews on this site, this insulin has raised not lowered. Initially I thought I wasn't using enough or perhaps taking it at the wrong time, but now I realize it isn't just me. I went back to original Novolog Flaxpen fast acting, just using lower doses three times daily because it was brining it too low in the past.",4,1,1
works ok,2,2,4
"Since I started using novalog I have gained weight and I have lost aLot of hair, I can't prove it's from the medicine but all this started after taking the medicine..",3,1,3
It has improved my health status,4,4,4
seems the higher the dose my doctor gave me the more my legs hurt...they ache,2,1,2
I was on Humolog and had very good results with that flex pen. My insurance made me change to Novolog and i have had my sugar too high. I found that the pens are defective and not giving the dosage you adjust it for. I have sent back 4 pens to caremark and have 2 more bad ones. The defects i found were the pens leak so your not getting the full injection and the gear drives in them have not pushed the plunger down which reduces the dosage. I have to check my sugar more regularly and keep making adjustments to control my sugar. When your injecting yourselves watch the plunger to see if it's moving.,2,1,2
"Immediately lowered by sugar levels once I titrated to the correct dose.  I was in the upper 400's and with 50 units twie a day, now I am around 150.  Only complaint is that anything over 40 units starts to hurt when injecting, but I think that is the case with any flex pen.",5,4,4
I was switched from levomir to novalog 70/30.  Started 1 week ago and blood sugar has continue to go up.,4,1,1
"This medication makes my blood sugar worse instead of better.  I am taking 75 units of Lantus at night and the -100 /30 formula for Novolog.  For example, I checked my blood sugar @ 0612 when I woke up & it was 200.  I haven't eaten since the evening before, but this has become the norm since I started taking Novolog. I took 3 units of Novolog.  Checked blood sugar again @ 0654 and it was 205.  Blood sugar went up 5 points without eating.  I am going to stop taking Novolog unless otherwise directed by my caregiver.",3,1,1
"I just started taking the Novolog Mix and instead of my blood sugar going down, it went up! That was without eating a meal. My Dr. took me off all other diabetes meds. (Glipzide, Lantus), and just has me taking the Novolog. Sugar sky-rocketed to 354! Before he switched my meds, my highest reading was 205! Novolog is NOT working for me.",4,1,1
"I just started using this med about 1 month ago. My sugars were usually 250 to 300. I did not change my diet or excercise, now sugars 150 to 180.",4,4,5
easy to use flex pen on two orals also still have trouble keeping sugar under 200,5,3,3
this medication ups my sugar.it dont seem to be working for me.,1,1,1
I have  had to use standard needs for delivery  and I prefer that it is easier to store and use with less injection sight pain and no need for refrigeration makes it easy  just dial install needle and administer and your done .,5,5,4
i feel like shit sometimes,1,1,1
"I SEEM TO ALWAYS BE HUNGRY THEREBY CAUSING WEIGHT GAIN. MY READINGS ARE ALWAYS CLOSE TO 20O OR HIGHER DUE TO MY EXCESS EATING. I WAS PUT ON NOVOLOG 70/30 INSULIN AND TAKEN OFF OF BYETA SHOTS PRIOR TO MEALS. BYETA WORKED VERY WELL IN KEEPING BY BLOOD SUGAR DOWN AND ALSO KEPT MY WEIGHT DOWN, BUT THE DOCTOR CHANGED MY PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE KIDNEY AND OTHER PROBLEMS.",5,3,3
i have been on these meds for almost two years i have gained over 50lbs. and my legs feet and hands are always swollen and my blood sugars are higher than befor i was on this medication,5,1,2
"Diabetes specialist prescribed Novolog 70/30 for me.  Blood sugar has been higher than ever. Everytime I eat, glucose goes over 300 ml/dl.  I been loosing weight and weigh now 108 lbs. I feel like hell on a daily basis and have to drag myself to an extremely stressful job.  I need some help, please!!!!  I am desperate!!!",3,1,1
i been using this for 3 years and it works great and its easy to use and its not painful when i take the dosage,5,5,5
"I have used this insulin for over 2 yrs. I was curuse if it causes weight gain and I just found out that it does.I have tried to lose my belly fat, now I know why I am having trouble losing that belly fat.",5,5,5
its sasy to use and effective,5,5,4
my sugar levels seem to escalate.  I spend every hour in the bathroom at night,4,2,1
"I,ve been using novolog 70/30 since january 2008 at first it worked great, it was the only thing that kept my bllod sugars normal,over the past few months however it seems like its stopped working my blood sugars are higher now than they've ever been, so bad in fact I was rushed to the ER on sept.02,08. Has this happened to anyone else. I'm definately not feeling myself and I'm getting extremely worried.",3,2,3
Blood sugar has been getting progessively higher each time I use this medication.,4,1,1
"type I diabetic, with dieting and exercise, works very well to keep my blood sugar under control ",5,4,4
I have tried several other meds and didn't get results. Novolog mix has really made a difference.,4,4,3
BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS MUCH HIGHER THAN WITH PREVIOUS TREATMENT,3,1,1
"It is very effective in maintaining blood sugars, and the intake of carbs/sugars. I would not recommend for someone with a extremely active lifestyle since it is fast-acting, and can cause drops in your blood sugar more than you've ever experienced.",5,5,5
"It works great to lower my blood glucose after meals, but it makes my heart beatting very fast, then swollen tonsils and throat tightness!",5,1,5
"Have used Novolog flexpens since 2004 with no problems except over the last few months.  Several instances of plunger sticking (but may be needle prob vs pen issue) and more concerning, I've had to toss 3 pens in last few months because the medicine simply was not doing its job.  Began new pens each time and levels went right down.  If this continues will seek alternative, as this is unhealthy for me and too costly to be tossing just to find one in box that is effective.",4,4,4
Delivery system is flawed. It is not just one pen or one box. I have had several pens where depressing the plunger is very difficult resulting in pen movement or pain.. monologue has replaced an entire box because of one flawed pen. I will be requesting my doctor for an alternative,1,2,5
Both sample pens are defective. They don't dispense the meds even after priming - on the next shot the previous one comes out when the pen is primed. Which means no medicine was delivered. Followed all directions and been using long term insulin for 5 years so not the operator.,2,1,2
Use to use the medications in pen form.  I now use vials in my insulin pump and it has made a big difference.  12.89 A1C before pump went down to 5.7 A1C with insulin pump therapy.  The long lasting insulin had little effect and switching to all rapid insulin solved my problems.  Now my weight is going back down easily where before I couldn't keep from gaining a pound.  Well controlled on insulin pump therapy!!,5,5,5
Diabetes is Very Hard Work. It's up to you. I've been type 1 for 45 years. I'm 51. It's a tough life but it beats the alternative. I use novolog in an insulin pump. A1C is 6.2-6.4. I had years of poor control and then I decided I'd rather be healthy.  Much better decision!,4,5,5
"It works for lowering glucose, but I sweat like crazy and shiver uncontrollably. The info on the internet scares me. I want to go back to my doctor.",5,2,3
"I have been using Novolog for under a year and the only reason I am using it is because my insurance company will no longer cover Humalog, which I have used for 30 years. I never had a problem with Humalog turning cloudy but in the past few months I have had to throw away 3 bottles of Novolog because they turned cloudy in the bottle. I am on an insulin pump and I change tubing every 3 days. The last bottle of Novolog I opened I filled the insulin pump one time and 3 days later when I went to fill it again the insulin was cloudy. The Novolog had an expiration date of 12/2014 and is control # BZF0540. The insulin is fine when stored in the refrigerator but I carry it in my pocket in a plastic case made for that purpose. I fill my pump 4 times from a bottle which should equate to about 12 days of use from one 10ml. bottle of Novolog and it is turning cloudy after 1 or 2 uses causing a lot of waste. I keep unused bottles in the refrigerator and 1 bottle at room temperature. This product is inferior to Humalog and I don't like insurance companies dictating which products I can and cannot use as peoples lives are at stake. I also have had days of high blood sugar until I figured out the insulin had turned cloudy and was no longer effective. What good is an insulin that only lasts a few days at room temperature? My doctor tells me she only uses Novolog when treating patients in the hospital and that Humalog and Novolog are basically identical but I suggest in a hospital setting temperature is more controlled and there are fewer variables than when 1 person uses 1 bottle until empty. I am also seeing bubbles in the bottle as well as cloudiness.",5,2,4
"The only problem with this product is that I cannot afford this medication.  I am on Social Security, and though I have insurance, the deductible is $135.00 every 28 days, and I cannot afford this medication.",4,3,3
OK   I have been using this medication over 2 years It works perfectly!  Ya I have had a couple lows..  Thats my fault for over medicating myself!   People you need to learn  how much Novolog you need measured in Units!!!  I started with 2 units at meal times for type 2 diabetes.  Now I take up to 15 units at meal times.   Like for breakfast and dinner.   Im on the sliding scale which is something everyone should learn about!   If you use this medication correctly You wont have any problems with it.   Most people never learn how to use the medication correctly.   or they complain about weight gain... If you start gaining weight  GO EXERCISE!   I work out 3 to 4 times a week.  Even if you cant go to a gym  go for a walk  or something.   Look up Home Exercises on google if you have to.     People need to stop complaining about this medication  and saying it doesn't work.  Stop being lazy! ,5,5,5
"I have had diabetes for two years now, after spending a week in the ICU, $70,000 bill. Using this medication alone is not enough for me, blood sugar levels swing high to low. I was taking between 5-10 units 4-5 times a day when I took this medicine by its-self. Taken with long lasting Lantus, 40 units per night, I have been able to maintain my sugar levels very well, and while staying on a very strict diet, I have recently, on occasion, not needed to use the Aspart (Novolog)for a day or two. Which I enjoy not having to get poked with the needle so much. ",5,4,4
I have used novolog now for overa year.  It does take care of ur highs but only for a while as they state a quick insulin.  Overall it a constant checking of glucose throughout the day. The worst is the weight gain.,3,2,3
I have been on Novo for almost three weeks now. I am getting very good results. I had an A1C of 12.0 last MD appt. but the therapy is working well for me. It should be noted that you have to balance diet and exercise with this medication in order to get the best benefit from it. No longer can I eat just ANYTHING I wanted to. I must adhere to a lifestyle change. We can feel better if we take care of ourselves.,5,5,5
it makes my stomac hurt ,5,3,2
Got to see Doctor (again) Night sweats and very rapid heart beat. Heart beating at 106 wears me out. ,3,1,3
not satisfied ihad all the symptoms of  diebetics while on medication,4,2,2
blood sugar going up,4,3,2
Easy to use with a sliding scale.  Conveniant pen that I can keep in my shirt pocket and looks like an ordinary pen.  Loud clicking while setting the dose and injecting does make it difficult to be discreet though good for the visually impaired.,5,5,5
Combined with an insulin pump was able to get A1C below 7.0 for the first time in years.,5,5,5
it work good and i am very satisfied with it,5,5,5
i broke out with a terrible rash on face nose and ears was real bright red like i was in poison ivy stopped it fast,3,1,2
Novolog has worked for about six weeks. Now it does not seem to do anything. One hour after a shot me reading went up 21 points.,5,1,1
"recently diagnosed.  It works very fast for me. I'm supposed to take it before EACH meal.  I noticed my numbers drop rapidly after taking it. Once I went from 167(before breakfast) to 66 in 2 hrs and yes, I had a healthy breakfast.",5,4,4
it works. i seem to have a lot of water retention about 20lbs in 3 days,3,3,3
very good results,5,5,5
I missed taking my inulkin last night for my diabetes. Shall I take it now?,5,5,5
since using this med. I have improved greatly.,4,4,1
I'm type 1 and have used novolog as my fast acting and love it.  I use a lot of insulin and this has been by far the best I've used.  ,5,5,5
"On Insulin Pump for about 1 year and very happy. So much easy to have my diabetes under control. DM type 1 is very tricky, discipline is the key for the success.",5,5,5
 been using on a sliding scale and is working well.   I am happy with it and will comtinue to use it.,5,5,4
"I take 10units before supper, and whatever I eat sugare readings are very high",2,1,1
i have been using this product with the pump for 5yrs. plus and have been really satisfied. i have to change the infusion site every three days or less. i by that time need to refill the cartridge with insulin anyway. the pump is all i have used with this insulin. never have i had to inject it with a syringe. the pump is set to give me my needed dosage 24/7 and then i adjust for meals.,4,4,4
I have been using it for a long time through injections and infusion pumpbut now i have beengetting high blood sugars readings. i have and infection so i don't know if it's the antrobitic i am on or it is the infection.,4,4,4
makes me feel nausea and no energy,2,1,3
I find using this medication works sometime immediately and other times it not as fast acting as they say. I do get the jitters and sometime a rush. Somewhat pleased with it.,4,4,4
Have taken for years having trouble few months with the pens being hard to dispense having to press so hard ,2,4,5
"Novolog is effective but expensive. I switched to Novolin, which is equally effective for me but much cheaper. Walmart offers it over the counter. Syringes are a little more work than the convenience of a pen set but save money. I find both cheap pen set needles and syringes online.",5,3,5
"Took Novolog for years, had to switch to Humalog because of insurance reasons. Taken Humalog for about 3 yrs now, think its a waste of time and money. Now able to return to Novolog as it is now covered by insurance. So happy!",5,5,5
Pen leaks. My a1c has risen. Don't seem to ever get enough insulin,2,1,2
"I'm new with this, so I don't know if I'm giving myself enough or not. I'm on 12 units right now and my sugar still rises above 300. any advice will be helpful",5,1,1
"Martine E. Wurst, PA-C and Hycinth Thomas, Endocrinologist, PA-C put me on NovoLog for Nutrtion and if glucose levels elevated.  Hycinth is no longer my Endocrinologist.  However, since I have been put on NovoLog, it totally works without any problems.  Some Medical Professionals need to be clarified on the Glucose Ranges of 70-130 mg./ dL.  I have been told by several 80-200 then, 80-120 mg./ dL. is the correct range.  It is due to the time when they went to Medical School.  They should try their best to keep updated on the Meducal Information on all illnesses.  Just being straight forward and honest.  Thank you for clarifying the glucose range of 70-130 mg./ dL. being the correct range.",5,5,5
starting sugar glusloe go to low to often or to high,2,1,1
"Was taking Humalog for several years - have been taking Novalog because it is cheaper.  I take it with Levimir(55 units) and take about 54 units each meal.  The effect in me can be delayed up to 4 hours, but it might be the scar tissue in my abdomen from taking so many shots.  Taking more than 30 units can be hard and I sometimes split the shots to make it easier.",3,3,3
Over all Novolog is good for diabetes it work well to keep my blood sugar down. I was having servere muscle cramps. To make a long story short the Novolog was causing me to have the severe cramps so the Dr. changed me to Medforman and Glipzide and so far the cramps have gotton much better almost none now.,5,2,5
Has been getting jammed.  Sent to ER with overdose.  Extra insulin stayed in needle.,1,1,1
"Other than wasting the air shot insulin I don't have a problem with the ease of use, it's quick and easy.  I do seem to have one side effect, I am constantly hungry, try to only eat things that will not raise my sugar, but I have gained eight pounds in the 3 weeks since i started taking it.  I just got a treadmill, hoping that will help.",4,5,5
"this treatment works very well for me if I take it on time the way I should. I like it because if my blood sugar is high and I take it, it brings it down very quickly.  ",5,5,5
"Aboutf three weeks after I started taking Novolog 70/30 and taking a Sandostatin shot for my carconoid tumors in my liver,the next day my upper arms and shoulders start hurting and have not stopped until now.  Could it be something in the Novolog 70/30 that I was reacting to?  ",4,3,3
Some pens are super and others I wonder if they are not sending the amount of insulin I have programmed it to send.  Some pens I consistently see high Blood Sugar readings.  I am experimenting with changing the pen to see if that makes a difference.  ,5,3,3
"We are experiencing difficulty having confidence with the pen. We have watched the ""how to video"" to be sure we are doing it correctly. The pen seldom if ever reaches zero with a single push of the button (usually 2-3 times). We always do the air shot to be sure the tip is not clogged! Is any one else having this issue? We simply can't be sure how much insulin has been given!",2,2,3
"I've been taking novalog flexpen for about 6 months now before each meal.  I also take 65 units of levemir once daily.  My novalog injections are based on what my sugar reading is and the number of carbs I'm about to eat at each meal.  I started out lower units, but now take 13 base units for each meal with 45 carbs or more or 10 base units for each meal with less than 45 carbs and to each I add 1 unit per every 25 I am over 100.  I understand it's different for everyone and you just have to start low and find what works for you.  The main thing for me was learning what number of carbs I was going to consume at any given meal.  It got easier with practice.  I've had diabetes for over 10 years, but only been on insulin therapy for past 6 months.  I find my body tolerates the insulin better than the metformin and actos I was on, in fact so far I've had no side effects.  The injections were not as painful as I had imagined.  The testing needle hurts worse.  I've lost 30 pounds in 6 months, but I contribute that to my drastic change in diet, but proves you don't have to gain weight on insulin.  I don't know about the long term effects of insulin, but feel it is best for me now. ",3,3,4
I have been on Novolog flex pen for about a year..have been mostly satisfied with it. I do wonder if anyone else has had any problem with Low blood pressure and muscle pain in their legs..,4,4,4
"The NovoLog FlexPen is very easy to use and convenient, especially when I'm away from home. It works quickly, and overall, I feel much more in control of my blood sugar. It's much better than the pills that I had used for years.",5,5,5
"I didn't give it the overall 5 stars because I'm not sure if it is in fact the Novolog that is working in my case or the combination that I also take Levemir insulin and the drug Metformin. My AIC has also dropped from 12 to 6.8. I do find it annoying in any case to have to prepare and take the drug before I put any food into my mouth. But that, of course, isn't the drugs fault, it's the disease's fault. In any case, it does seem to work in keeping my sugar level down. I just need to work on an exercise program that is right for me and get my weight down. I do feel as if I'm hungry most of the day and turning away from food and snacks almost seems impossible. I also have to find a schedule that fits me during my work hours when I can administer the drug without perfroming blood tests and having to inject it in front of co-workers. I do like the convenience of using the pen compared to having the vile of insulin and the syringe with a much longer needle. I'm  not able to carry alcohol with me at my work place nor do I believe we have alcohol swabs here. So, I kind of have to rely on everything hopefully being pre-sterilized before I inject the insulin. The situation is not 100% comfortable with me but it's getting better over time. ",4,4,4

"My A1C was over 12.0 so I was placed on this medication in early August. I have done a complete turnaround in my diet and I try to exercise every day and the therapy has worked very well for me.

"The Flexpen involves some fiddling around befoe and after use. You have to attach a needle before use and you can't carry the Flexpen with needle attached. The air shot might be wasting some insulin that you are paying for, and there is a dribble of insulin on withdrawing the needle. Makes me wonder did I get the whole dose or is some of it dribbling away. You can't go out to dinner and inject yourself unobtrusively.  A prefilled syringe is much better for that job. Everybody will notice your Flexpen because of its black and orange colors. It's too big to clip into your pocket like a ball pen. Flexpen is good to carry with you and it's not too hard to use.

I switched to insulin from glipizide because my husband and I are trying to conceive. I really like the control I get from Novolog. My doctor paired it with 10 units of Lantus and Metformin.

Plus what most people dont realize is they also have to change their diet.   you can't just take a pill and keep eating Junk food and expect your sugar levels to be Normal..   I have read most of the reviews  and  see that most diabetics are very stupid people!,5,5,5
It worked well at getting my numbers down but I had severe dry mouth and my feet were swollen to the point of not being able to wear some shoes. My doctor took me off.,5,2,4

"Have been on it for almost 2 years. My A1C has gone up. I recently stopped taking it and my bloog sugars have actually come down. With all the bad press surrounding this drug, I do not find it to be worth the risk in continuing to take.",3,1,2
This little pill works wonderful for me. I do get the headaches and leg pains but the fact that my blood sugar is no longer in the 300's is awesome! I don't even have to use my insulin!! It is a GREAT pill.,5,5,5
"Worked really good for 6 Months ,Then nothing ,  The Headaches were debilitating .. ",3,3,3
"I have experienced leg pain, and skin rashes on my legs. Blood sugar really hasn't improved that much. Anyone else scared to take Onglyza?",5,3,3
ok so far ,4,4,4
it works fine but insurance co. won't cover so now have to use tradjenta good luck everyone.,5,4,4
"Just found out after three months on Onglyza along with Metformin that my BS is through the roof.  It is my working at all for me.  In 20 years, I have never had this problem. A1c IS 11.2 !!!   It was 7.7 3 mos ago and my former medication was changed to Onglyza as it was the latest, newest, best thing.  NOT SO.  I have gum problems, and a skin problem, I now think might be related. I am scared as to what might have happened internally.",5,1,1
I HAVE TYPE 2 MY DOCTOR PUT ME ON THIS MEDICINE. WITH IS ONGLYZA 2.5 MG. IS IT HARMFUL TO TAKE WITH INSULIN.MY BLOOD SUGAR IS OK.,4,4,4
"This drug seems to elude everyone in Walgreens Pharmacy, they can't get it or you need prior authorization to even qualify. Oh well!!!!!",2,1,3
i been having pain in my legs and feet while i can't stand for a long time. I decided to do research on this pill.My pain comes on a regular basic now i mention it to my doctor she said its not coming from onglyza but what i read on the side effects so far it does.,4,3,4
"I really wanted this to work for me! But, started with a mild headache. I kept taking hoping it would eventually go away. But, headaches got worse until Ibuprofen stopped working and I couldn't get out of bed until the afternoons. Then stomach pains and indigestion. My blood sugars stayed the same the first few days, then went up 50 points the rest of the time. The last couple days of using this med, I started having dizzy spells. That's when I quit taking it. I'm sticking with low-carb. Better results without the side effects!",5,1,1
blood sugar and feeling well ovrall.,5,5,5
I just learned that the diabetes drug Onglyza might be causing Pancreitic cancer.  I take 5mgs aday.  Iam calling my doctor next week for an appointment to discus this.,4,4,1
"No problems, just a huge fight between mt Doctor, and Insurance over cost of this medicatin. Very expensive.",5,5,5
No side effects and bs is stable now,5,5,5
"Have been on this medication for almost one month.  Have not noticed any lowering of my blood sugars, but I have noticed an increase   in my heart rate...it is normally around 55-60 bpm...it is between 90 and 110 now",4,1,2
"Have taken 8 days.  Extreme fatigue.  Bloated painful abdomen, swollen and hard.  The trots and lots of gas.  Have a fever and I feel like I have the flu.  Sugars are rising.  This stuff is poison!",4,1,2
After a few months I lost weight! And my BS has dropped. I had difficulty taking Victoza and Glucophage so I am taking onglyza alone.,5,4,4
I have headaches in the morning blood sugar drops suddenly and it's too hard to bring it up again. I itch and have stomach problems.  Stopped taking this med and starting to feel better.  I have better control with insulin,5,1,2
This medication has worked great forme!,1,1,1
Isn't all that effective in lowering my blood sugar.,5,2,3
"I was on this med as well as amaryl. It did not work for me. My legs hurt to the point where I had trouble walking. My vision became blurry. My blood sugar actually went up! I keep my carbs to about 150 a day. even tho I'm not taking it any longer, my legs still cramp and twitch.",4,1,1
Been taking Onglyza about 3 months. Has lowered my reading to acceptable levels. But I have to count carbs. And watch everything I eat. So I don't eat too much or the wrong things. Haven't noticed any side effects. Except for a stuff nose some. And have had a few leg cramps but not on a regular basis. Will probably continue to take this medicine. As I have tried 2 other medicine's. And they tend to lower my sugar too low too fast. And I can't stand the low sugar shakes.,5,5,3
"Have many of the same side effects as listed with others. But in addition to went to the eye doctor for a checkup. She sent me from there right to my own GP to have me taken off this medicine. She is also sending  me go to a eye specialist, she fears I may have suffered vision loss or even damage to left eye.",4,2,3
"In less than one week, my sugars had moved down to mostly the 80-90 range at any given time of the day or night.  My skin is so much softer and I feel great.  My fasting sugar in morning is usually below 105 everyday--am so pleased.  No problems healthwise noted at this point.  Have been taking Onglyza for 5 weeks now and very pleased.  Also take small dosage of Metformin and Amaryl.  Blood pressure is good also.",5,5,5
"I have been on onglyza for two years now. It has not brought my sugers down enough to really be worth the pain.   I have told the Doctor that I hurt all over. I hurt bad in my lower stomach. She wouldn't take me off of it so two months ago I stopped taking it. I hurt even worse now. I guess my body is in shock or something. It's so bad I ach all over and have trouble getting up even walking is difficult. I havent told my doctor yet, but I'm sure she will tell me to start taking it again. I don't know how much more I can deal with the pain. I wish I had never been put on this medication. Is there any hope for me or am I going to have to live this way from now on?",4,1,2
"Tried it for a couple of days and thought I had the flu, so stopped until I felt better - about a week.  Then took one pill.  Blood pressure and sugar both sky-rocketed.  Had debilitating headache similar to migraine that wouldn't go away, I felt like I had been poisoned.  ",4,1,1
Increased my blood sugar readings. I felt bloated. Stopped using after 1& 1/2 week.,5,1,1
"Taking this drug with Metformin.  Sugar levels in morning higher than usual, havent seen any benefits.  Was placed on this to lower agi levels but dont see this happening.  Going back to dr to review.",3,1,2
"I was taking Onglyza 5mg for 2 months after I had to stop Januvia due to overall itching with no rash.  Took Januvia for 2 years, couldn't figure out the itching.  Within 2 weeks of starting the Onglyza, my itching returned, only much worse.  I had breaks in the skin from scratching.  It did lower my levels, but could no longer stand the itching, as it affected my ability to sleep without taking an antihistamine nightly.  Also, experienced increase in hair loss, which I was already battling.  It was not worth it.  Onglyza lowered my quality of life.",3,1,2
"Not very satisfied.  This drug caused my blood sugars to stay higher than normal (not excessive).  Worked for about 2 weeks, then didn't really help after that.  Actually caused severe mood swings among other things.  Not very satisfied.  Started on insulin while on Onglyza and am finding that I don't need the Onglyza and my blood sugar is actually lower since I have stopped taking Onglyza.  Would recommend if you're not on insulin, but if you're on insulin, you really don't need this.  The side effects are good great to outweigh the benefits.",4,1,2
"Been on this pill for 4 days.  I am very satified with my morning readings...came down from 150-185 to today 99.  However, have terrible hearburn and reflux.  Stomach feels sore when I eat something.  Will continue using and see if the side effects go away.",5,5,5
"I have only been taking since 9/26/11. Have noticed distended abdomen, foul tasting gas when burping uncontrollably. Then the vomiting and diarea started. Side effects not worth the small benefit.",5,1,2
Take Metformin plus started Onglyza for three months now; IT DOES NOTHING TO HELP.  Reading first thing in morning even higher than usual. Too expensive -- also -- stop taking it.,3,1,1
Better than Januvia,5,5,4
Only thing keeping me off insulan great pill just a bit pricey.  ,5,5,5
"I took this for 1 month with my other diabetes meds upon dr. request.  I immediately noticed that I was having some side effects (headache, stuffy nose).  I called my dr. who wanted me to keep trying it.  I continually got worse.  After 4 weeks, i called the dr. back.  He took me off Onglyza but wanted me to try Junivia.  This was over a week ago & I have not tried the new med because I have been so sick.....upper respiratory problem turned into chest congestion like none other!!  I have never had anything like this so I think the Onglyza has caused this.",5,1,3
Was on this drug for 3 mo's. Started to itch and it got worse. After3 mo's I developed rash on arms and belly. Stopped taking drug and rash And itch disappered.,4,1,2
"I started taking Onglyza in 12-2010 and my fasting blood glucose levels have gone down about 30 points.  I have to be very careful in the P.M. because my glucose level tend to dip very low.  I am also on Metformin 500X2,glipizide 5mgx2, long-acting insulin 18 units daily.  The one side effect I have notices is frequent upper respiratory infections.  Other than that the drug has worked real well for me. ",5,4,5
"since i have started this medication i have had alot of episodes of low blood sugar, and i can't seem to get my sugar to go up. i also take 1000mg of metformin twice a day. my a1c is 5.8. i wonder if i need this onglyza still. ",3,2,3
This medication is awful.  It made my glucose go so low that I was in diabetic shock.  Never again!!! That was from just a half of a pill on day one. ,2,1,1
"30 days use.  Swelling --hands,feet,legs. Have stomach pain,night sweats,leg pain and headaches.   So lethargic, I Thought I might have to quit my job. Stopping the drug.  Taken with 1000mg metformin at bedtime. Did lower sugar in morning, but not worth it.",4,1,3
"I have been on Onglyza for 2 weeks.....I have Dawn Phenomen Diabetes, meaning my surgar goes up during the night when I sleep and during the day decreases. My morning readings decreased  by 20 pts.  A possible side effect that I need to get information on is that I am feeling DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS.  I am lethargic and lack ambition.  I take Onglyza in the morning.  Today I stopped Onglyza because I want energy without anxiety and depression which is a horrible feeling...I am beginning to feel 'numb'...I am on no other medication...I cannot contact Onglyza by phone which is a great disappointment.",5,3,3
People's bodies work diffrently with this drug but If you feel any sever side effects like I did with Onglyza do not wait and call your Doctor right way. ,1,1,1
"I have high sugar readings in the morning and taking Onglyza greatly improved my levels in the morning and during the day.  I also take Amaryl in the morning and after dinner. I was doing great on the drug up to about one month later.  I developed pain in my knees at first.  Then it progressed to my upper thighs and calves.  I literally could not walk.  The pain was so bad that I could not sleep and there was nothing to help alleviate the pain.     I thought that maybe, I had sciatica or some form of arthritis. I was also on Crestor and I thought that my leg cramps might be caused by that medication.  I stopped the Crestor and the pains got worse.  I got to the point that I was crying. I finally decided that I must come off of this horrible medication and without doctor's orders, I did.  After about two days, my pain has improved and I can finally I can finally walk and function again.  I will have to notify my doctor of my action and I will never take this medication again.  It is very expensive and I would rather die than take this medication again. ",5,1,5
This medication is really bad for me.  The side effects that it has caused to me are terrible! It should be ilegal to sell a medication like this.,2,1,1
"If you take Coumadin or another blood thinner you should never take Onglyza. It has a dramatically adverse effect on your Coumadin levels and the Coumadin seems to destroy any positive effect the Onglyza has on blood sugar levels. After a month on Onglyza, with no other changes in diet or medication, my Coumadin levels were at historic lows. 2 weeks after stopping Onglyza the Coumadin level was back to normal and blood sugar was improved",3,1,1
"I've been on this med for approx. 2 weeks now. I was afraid at first from all of the negative comments I read.  However, this has been the best thing for me.   My numbers have improved tremendously.  I've had no problems and will continue to use it.",5,5,5
I took ongliza a few days and feel asleep within a few hours of taking it. I was too grogy to drive or do much of anything except sleep. It did not seem to help my blood sugar level ,4,1,1
"After taking Onglyza for 5 weeks my morning blood sugar improved from 250 to 145.  However, I also became alergic with swelling and irritation in the mouth.  I currently take Metformin 1000 x 2 a day and am exploring other medications with my doctor to better control my morning blood sugar.",5,1,3
"I have been taking this for last 3 weeks. For the first time I saw my # in morning go to 110 range. I always have been seeing it around 150-180.  But then it again jump back to 190 now so I am not seeing lots if improvement. Might give a try for another week.  I am taking glimeperide 5mg and metforming 1000 mg twice a day and started Onglyza. One symptom I am feeling is heart burn and acid reflux started this week, 3 rd week on onglyza.",4,2,2
"Ditched ACTOS 6 mos ago, and started Onglyza.  My morning surgars are down from avg 225 to 120.  Have experienced tingling in both hands in last month.  No feet issues.  I take 1000mg metformin am and pm.  get my 6 mo A1C next week.  We shall see positive trend.  Difficult to lose weight despite heavy physical activity.  ",3,5,4
"I have been on Onglyza for about a week; and I have noticed that my blood sugars are at an acceptable range. I'am very much pleased with this medication and its effectiveness. My medical ins. takes care of most of the cost, I only pay $9.00 for 30 pills.",5,5,5
"Was experiencing morning highs around 220-280, After started Onglyza, my morning readings are 100-117.  I feel so much better!",5,5,5
"Taken since 3/2010 with Metformin 500 am - 1000 at dinner, Lantus 14 units at bed. Lowered my am readings from 180+ to 120 providing I don’t eat late at night. No side effects noticed except: possible strange vivid dreams. Will talk to Dr. about this. No weight or appetite loss. Over all, very satisfied with this med.",5,5,5
i have been on this medication for about 2 weeks now and it seems to be helping lower my blood sugars the only thing it is very costly and i don't think i can afford to but it other than that it is great,5,3,4
"Been taking Onglyza 5mg for one week along with Metformin 1000mg am and 1000mg pm. Noticable decline in glucose levels, however experiencing headaches,dry mouth, sleepleness, very lethargic, and loss of appetite resulting in 5lb weight loss in 1 week. Although the weight loss could be an added benefit in long term control of glucose levels. Hopeing the othe side effects deminish over time.",5,3,4
I had trouble getting my sugar down. So asked my Dr to try it. It really works well for my type 2 diabetes.Mornings my sugar would spike.,5,5,5
"My husband was diagnosed by our General Doctor as type2, but the tests has come back as type 1.  He has been taking Onglyza, and it reduced his sugar from 400-500 to 100-120.  If this doesn't continue to help, he was told his only logical option will be insulin.  So far, so good.  ",5,4,4
Started Onglyza with Metformin and another med after I had to stop Actos.  Onglyza is very expensive med and doesn't seem to work at all for me.  I stll have high morning fasting blood sugar readings....same as I had when I stopped Actos.  Seems to be of no help.   ,4,1,1
"i've just recently started this drug and have noticed that i am bloated and have indigestion after meals, and have noticed excessive body heat, sweats.",4,3,3
"I am not sure if the problems I'm having are from taking this drug.  Started taking it about the same time I began having difficulty sleeping, dry mouth, lethargic, endema in legs and aching all over my body.",5,2,4
Maybe my review is a bit premature but I just started taking this medication last week. The day after I started taking it I began to feel extremely lethargic and began running a low-grade fever (99-100) off and on. Feeling bad in general. I take 1 Onglyza with 1 750 Metformin in the AM and then 1 Metformin 750 at night. My levels have come down some but not significantly enough where I'd like them. Maybe I just haven't given it time. I could just have a UTI or something but the coincidence is strange. Giving it a few more days and then I'm calling dr. I've lost about 18 lbs recently - don't have the sweet cravings mentioned but I have NO energy to exercise which is not good!,5,3,3
I have daily headaches since starting this medication.  I also have had intense cravings for sweets and have gained 5 pounds in the 7 weeks I have taken Onglyza.,5,2,3

I don't feel it is worth taking, with this pain and I've also noticed hair loss but could be from another med, I started near the same time. I am going off it and hope to find something that lowers without causing a worse problem. None of this was explained to be, prior to my starting Onglyza. Would NOT recommend! Worried about this pain.

"My 100 year old mom has taken this med for about 20 some years, the last 9 of which I have been her 24/7 care provider.  I found out how many points her sugar increases per carbohydrate eaten and then how much it was decreased by taking 1 mg of Prandin/Repaglinide.  Knowing this information has allowed me to regulate her medicine for anything she eats and it has been working out very well except when taking some UTI medicine...they tend to decrease her sugar without as much medicine.  (At 100, she doesn't exercise much which makes figuring easier.)  Love the medication and thankful it doesn't cause cancer, like so many of the other diabetic medicine have as possible side effects.  Doctors may feel those are side effects ""they"" are willing to chance but not me for my mom!",5,5,5
on 5mg before lunch and dinner. this drug works wonders and if i need an extra pill its ok to take one if i want pizza or something like it...the generic didnt work and raised my sugar made me very sick so if you have trouble with this drug ask to try the REAL drug..a life saver for me and now i can have lower sugars almost normal...thank god my dietition new about this not all dr. do they push insulin instead..ask for this ,5,5,5
Taking about two years. No side effects other than two instances when I did not eat after taking.  Low blood sugar is scary. A1C was 6.3 but also exercise 5 times a week and have good diet and weight control. INSULIN IS LIKE THE BOGY MAN FOR ME SO I WORK HARD TO KEEP FROM HAVING TO TAKE IT. ,5,5,5

"I am so glad that my doctor ordered Prandin for my diabetes type 2. I have been using it for the past three months and 100% satisfied with the results. Before , I used to be worried about checking my diabetes. I used metformin with glyburide and lantus injection. The results were unfavorable. Now I am not afraid to check my diabetes since the reading is where I wanted it. Great pill. I am so pleased. Now, Health First told me that they do not cover that pill. and so I discussed it with my doctor. If I have to scrape the last penny to buy it, I will keep on using this pill.",5,5,5
"It has dramatically lowered my blood sugar levels.  The first week was pure torture, as it tends to give you the runs.  After that it eased up.  One bad side effect is the weight gain.  I am working on that aspect, but if I cannot start losing weight, bye bye Prandin.",5,4,5

this medication has helped me control my sugar and help me get back to my life !,5,5,5
I just started taking Prandin today.  My blood sugar was over 200 this morning fasting; after  breakfast was still above 200.  I took my first dose of Prandin of 1mg at lunch and tested my blood sugar at 3pm and it come down to 82!.  I haven't seen a reading like that in a very very long time.  I felt jittery so i ate a small snack.  I am eager to see how this medicine will do in the next few days.,5,4,5
I am in compleet control from the first day of using prandin. This has been the best medication for helping me control diabeties.,5,5,5
"medicine has allowed me to lower my high glucose ceilings ,which I could not before. Very effective.",5,5,5
"Have taken Prandin for the last three months with each meal and it has been very effective in reducing blood sugar to below 100. However, it makes me a little jittery that I am slowly tolerating. I have reduced Prandin intake to just breakfast (my biggest meal) and that seems to be the best compromise.  ",5,3,5
"medicated worked great no blood sugars above 100 but the side affect are constipation, insomna, server nasuea",5,2,5

Stomach cramping. everything seems to tast very very salty.........,5,3,3
After having a stroke lost a great deal of weight and endocrinologist prescribed this and I got off insulin. Took Prandin for six months then lost more weight and stopped. Two years later put back on 20lbs and started taking Prandin again it helped me get A1C down to 6.3 from 7.0. Love the ease of taking before meals but sugars tend to fluctuate greatly from low 60's to over 200 depending time of day and amount of activity. I have noticed onset of neuropathy type symptoms and recently strong pains in my arms since restarted Prandin use. Went to cardiologist regarding arm pain though heart is still pretty healthy found it interesting that someone else noted the leg and arm pains... I had a great deal of leg muscle difficulty which I attributed to Crestor but now am wondering if it could be the Prandin? Have been diabetic 18 years and have good eye sight and good kidney health so I will continue Prandin as long as the Dr. says. Easier to travel with than insulin though that worked well while i needed it too.,5,5,4
My doctor has me take different strengths of Prandin depending on my meal size. Used to be on Starlix-it wasn't helping my sugars at all but Prandin seems to be keeping me under control very well.,5,4,4
"I have a lot of Gas and more tingling in my feet, calves and hands, although my sugar readings have been much better..I've only been on this med for 2 weeks..",5,3,3

This medication seems to have been a medical mirical for me. I was close to becoming insulin dependant but thanks to this medicin among the metformin glipizide actose and jenuvia my blood sugars never get over 200! I am no longer afraid to eat. Thanks to who ever created this medication.,5,5,5
"I had all of the side effects listed. The worst ones were bloading, gas and upset stomach. I also broke out in a rash. I was told to stop taking it.",4,2,2
"Have mild T2.  85% of the time this make my post-meal glucose normal.  Great!  A bit of a pain to take at every meal (usually 100mg), but at least it's small and easy to carry lots in a pillcase.  I lightly break it into numerous pieces in my mouth (avoiding getting too much saliva on it), swallow with a little water, then eat.  If you end up tasing it, no sweat, as it actually tastes pleasant.  There was some diahrrea early on, but the only side effect that never completely goes away is the farting -- usually awhile after eating.  But it's worth it, and I usually find ways to be discreet about it when around others.  Good drug, but wish the generic wasn't so close in price to the brand!",4,4,5

"I am on my second month with this. 25mg I first introduced this at dinner for a week,lunch a week later and then breakfast so I had 3 per day.

It lowers my blood pressure to 79/35. I almost pass out everytime I take it. My muscles are weak and hurt extremely bad. I stopped it. Terrible drug!!!,1,1,1
Usually I am a very energetic person. This has caused me to have muscle spasms and I am very tired and fatigued. I am having these sensations in my legs mostly.  I never had these symptoms until I started using these. I cant get off these soon enough. I am praying the damage can be reversed. ,2,1,3
"This drug caused me Shortness of breath,. Sleep Apnea and Cramps. I could not walk 50 feet without resting from the shortness of breath. .Co Q 10 helped with the cramps. I tried different statins and they all did the same thing to me. For 6 months doctors  tried to find a cure. I stopped taking the statins and and the  sleep apnea and shortness of breath went away in 5 days. Doctor had a hard time believing it was the statin. I hope this helps someone. (SAO)",1,1,1
"Seized my shoulders and arms up would never ever take it again. A work colleague had his leg muscles seize up so he could barely walk and I know of many others with similar reactions to this drug.

"I had high cholesterol with LDL's around 120 after 3 years of use. Down from 166 or higher, can't remember but total was 243 and HDL was 26.  Anyway, after 3 years they doubled my dosages from 20mg to 40mg and no change to LDL's.  ",3,2,3
"After taking this drug for 6 weeks, I had leg cramps so bad that I couldn't sleep.  I had to quit taking it.",3,1,3
I haven't been satisfied with this medicine. makes my muscles act,2,1,2
This is a bad drug.  They started me out on 80mg of simvastatin about 10 years ago and I started having severe chest pain and had to go to the ER with it twice.  The Doc lowered my dosage to 40mg but still had the same symptoms along with the feeling that my muscles were falling off of my bones.  I told the Doc about it but was told to take it anyway.  I stopped taking it ,4,1,4
"I've started taking simvastatin 3 months ago, I now have severe muscle wastage in several areas including my legs, arms, buttocks and stomach. I've had no energy and felt constantly tired, I've had a foggy brain, I've been staggering a lot and felt disoriented. I didn't take last night's in fact I won't be taking anymore. Prior to taking this drug I had built up good muscle tone since starting exercising from May last year, simvastatin has virtually destroyed my muscles in less than 10 weeks. I only found out by doing research online that statins deplete the body of CoQ10 enzyme, which is essential for ALL muscles to function properly, including the HEART. I can see the obvious wastage of muscle on my body and limbs, what I can't see is if my heart has also been damaged. Why does this lethal medication be given out without at least us also being given the supplements it deprives the body of? I have now bought the supplements I need to try and reverse the damage the statin has done, I can't believe how damaging one 40mg tablet every night has done to my body. Hopefully the CoQ10, magnesium, vitamin B complex and drinking Apple juice every day, will help repair the damage caused by simvastatin. I have also found out that people who exercise whilst on statins have an increased risk of muscle disease/wastage, why was I not made aware of this also. I should have been feeling great, exercising 3/4 Times a week and eating healthy, instead I feel ill and in agony. More awareness of the dangers of these drugs to patients by the health care professionals when administering, also adding the supplements necessary that they deplete when prescribing and close monitoring (every month) should be mandatory . .  BEWARE AND TAKE WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION ..  ",3,1,3
"Horrible drug. Should be banned. Causes blood sugar to spike to dangerous levels causing more than 10 times amount of insulin. Cramps and muscle aches. This drug actually contributes to heart disease by causing the spikes in blood sugar. Studies confirm spikes in blood sugar cause heart disease, the very reason one would take this drug, to avoid. Also, studies on heart disease say cholestoral is not key factor. Inflammation play a key factor. So treat high cholestoral with diet, not pills. They will kill you. I recommend this drug be banned. It is killing people. I believe this drug caused my father-in-law to go into kidney and heart failure.",1,1,1

This drug has worked to lower my cholesterol. I also had joint pain and fatigue. YOU HAVE TO TAKE COQ10 (ubiguinol). Do not buy regular COQ10 which is ubiquinoine. ONLY buy COQ10 ubiguinol. I take 2-100mg pills in the morning and an occasional pill in the afternoon. Everyone I know that takes statins is now on ubiquinol and won't go off it. You will notice an absolute difference in muscle fatigue and joint pain. Don't take statins without ubiquinol. ,4,4,4
This medicine made my stomach cramp I would almost be doubled over in pain. Tried taking with food but no difference. Stopped taking and stomach pain went away. ,5,1,2

My doctor finally told me to quit taking it and within 1 month I was feeling better and within 3 months was back to doing my old routine.",4,1,2
"Ok so its now 6 months since I took the last statin that I will ever take and the neck aches that were occurring every evening finally seem to be going away but I still have the snotty rhinitis for which there is no cure and very little treatment so it would seem I am to suffer from common cold symptoms for ever. I went to the GP and he said that maybe I should see a different doctor in the surgery or move to a different doctors surgery! I managed to stay calm but I thought thanks a bunch, you have made me ill, given me a permanent snotty head causing me to have difficulty sleeping for ever, made me miss a summer because I did not have the energy or enthusiasm to do anything and now you want me to just go away quietly. Whatever happened to the hypocratic oath? It appears that statin's are considered such a wonder drug partly because of the price (20 pence each) however when you add in the cost of the coenzyme q10 at about 65 pence each which everyone who is on statin's should consider taking the cost is nowhere near as attractive, also because the NHS won't fund coenzyme q10 they tell the doctors not to tell patients who could pay for them themselves about the potential  benefits so denying me the opportunity to feel better sooner",5,1,2

I felt colder all the time muscle aches, have had a cough for over a year, difficulty sleeping but tired all of the time almost zero sex drive, (I could get a hard on for England before this) I stopped taking them five months ago and the muscle aches have died back 50 percent but all of the other symptoms are still here in full, Doctors did not give me a liver enzyme test after 2 months which could have limited this damage, Doctor will not accept that the symptoms are anything to do with statin's and nobody from the Nhs will, everything that is written on the internet by the Nhs about statin's is positive and just about everything written about statin's by everyone else is negative. I read all the reviews here and at least I know that I am not alone but here in the Uk there is nowhere else to go that I can afford. I am very angry. I would have done myself less harm if I had taken heroin or crack cocaine for ten months! Now I just hope that this is not permanent and for ever the doctors are lying b*****ds",3,1,1
"62yrs old. Been taking 20mg for two weeks. Already my legs cramp so ad and worse at night when I lay down. Feel like I have no strength in legs.avid walker,but became afraid legs would feel worse. Stopped taking 3 days ago,already can sleep without pain med. not taking",5,1,1
"I took them for about 3 months. I have always been relatively fit and coordinated person. I soon experienced severe muscle weakness, muscle pain, muscle wasting and brain fog. I literally had to sit down walking from the kitchen to the bedroom, but for a while, I did not realize why. When questioned, the doctor said, and I quote: ""You are just going to have to find a way to deal with these side effects, 'cause you are going to be on them the rest of your life"". This statin induced muscle weakness resulted in two severe falls, a torn rotator cuff and a permanent dent in my skull!! I took myself off the statins, went on CoQ10. It took about 6 months for my strength to return. Please.....BE VERY CAREFUL with these statins. They were poison to my body. I wonder how many older Americans out there are feeling weak and are in pain due to these prescribed meds. Had my side effects not been as severe and come on so quickly, they may have been played off as simply getting old. ",2,1,2

"I first took simvastatin combined with ezetrol 5 years ago. A year later, I started having excruciating cramps in my feet and legs two hours after going to bed... I cannot count how many nights I couldn't lay down in bed... I had to sleep seated in an armchair (if I could sleep at all!)... useless to say that I could no longer function normally at work. I finally stopped taking that medication and I slowly recovered my LIFE... A year ago, I had a new GP who prescribed simvastatin without ezetrol (saying it was the latter that had caused the side effects)... now, after another year, I am back to square one... I will go for my blood tests, see my GP for results (I'm sure my cholesterol is quite low now, but I have no life) and announce that I am OFF this drug for good... as someone stated, I think there is a paranoid mentality about high cholesterol. I will take my chances with genetic high cholesterol because life is too short to live with debilitating pain caused by chemicals (fix a problem but provoke many others)!",5,1,5
"I was not on the medication very long before I started having severe pain in my joints. When I finally related my pain to the medication I quit taking it.  However, some days I still have debilitating pain in my joints.  I feel like I am 110!  Can anyone tell me how long it takes to get this out of your system?  I would have thought I would have been better by now",5,1,1
I'm a 67 year old female. I've been on 20mg of simvastatin for a few years with no problems. My recent blood test showed my cholesterol numbers had gone up so the doctor increased the dose to 40 mg about six weeks ago. I'm in agony with aches and pains in my shoulders and hands. Never dawned on me it was this increased dosage and out of sheer desperation went back to the doctor yesterday. I'm off the drug completely and go back to the doctor in two weeks. I'm still in great pain by hopefully this will end soon. I'm only sorry I didn't read these reviews before now. I was really starting to think I was becoming a hypochondriac. Thank you,5,1,5
"I had severe muscle weakness in my arms, I found it difficult to undertake daily tasks like getting undressed, brushing my hair, as unable to physically raise my arms.I couldn't turn over in bed, and an effort to get out of the bed too. I had problems getting on and of a bus. I also had tingling and numbness in my fingers. I was told by my GP that this was down to osteoarthritis;I was initially surprised that this was the case, but was convinced by my GP, and a blood test showed that the symptoms were not down to side effects. I had no reason to doubt the results. However, 6 months later I went on holiday and forgot my tablets,While there I went for long walks with no problem, which I attributed to the benefits of exercise.On my return I intended to renew my prescription, but almost 2weeks later I noticed some improvement in my symptoms and decided to stop taking simvastatin. It has taken some months, but I am free of al the symptoms,the last one desisting only 4 weeks ago.  My quality of life has improved greatly, for me that far outweighs the risk associated with high cholesterol. I write this in the hope this helps at least one person.had to give effectiveness 5 stars as wouldn't allow me to choose less.",5,1,5
"I took 40MG for over 8 years with no problems.  During this time it was effective and easy to use.  Then the leg cramps started in my upper and lower legs, the pain progressed to the shoulders, and is now in my arms and hands.  It was very effective for years, then all of a sudden, I fell apart.  7 months later the symptoms have not gone away.  Can't lay down without pain and have hardly slept (have to sit up to sleep).  Still waiting for it to take its natural course! (?)  Only took two medications before.  Now I take 7 just to manage this condition.  If I was not retired, I would have to.  ",5,1,4

All I can say is it lowered my cholesterol from over 250 to less than 100 in less than a year and I never seemed to have any of the side effects. However my doctor change it to pravastatin due to a potential interaction to amlodipine.   ,5,5,5

Had a heartburn episode last week that felt like a heart attack (chest pain and pain between shoulder blades). Welt  shrinks when I stop usage, grows when I resume medication.

" After taking Provachol for about 15 years my insurance forced me to Simvastatin due to price. I have been taking it for about 3 years. Since that time I have experienced just about all the side effects and they are getting worse. Mid spinal pain, aching and pain in both arms and hands, numbness, brain fog, short term memory loss, fatigue, and recently, severe pain and burning from my butt to my toes. It is so bad that I can barely walk. Worst pain is in my calves, ankles, and feet. Since taking Simvastatin I have also had increasing erectile dysfunction. Yesterday, while at our family Christmas gathering my brother told me of the side effects of Statin's. I started researching and low and behold here were all my problems. I am stopping the 40 mg dose of Simvastatin immediately. I just hope no long term damage to my body has occured. BTW, the drug did lower my cholesterol and triglyceride levels (which where not too high anyway.) I am not going to live like this the rest of my life. I will take the chance of not taking it by exercising and better diet. I have lost weight while on this drug as opposed to many others who have gained. I just hope I get back to normal.",4,3,4

"Was prescribed to use a 10mg Simvastatin and was almost like a sleeping pill the first couple of nights (slept 10+ hours) and encountered tingling in both hands, headache, face numbness and eventually a trip to the ER with a panic attack. Went off the medicine and felt fine before re-visiting my primary care physician who insisted that I return to taking the drug.   Took first pill in evening and slept 10 hours that night. Next day experienced brain fog, blurred vision, muscle pain in both arms and shoulders, numbness/tingling in both hands - can not imagine spending any amount time on this drug if this is the quality of life to be expected. I will be stopping usage and working hard on diet and exercise to elevate my quality of life!",2,1,1
"For 6 years I had burning chest pains on the left side which sent me to the emergency room twice. It finally got so bad I couldn't eat much and in 2 months I lost 21 pounds. After 3 doctors and numerous tests, no one could tell me what caused this problem. While talking to a friend, he told me of his bad experience with this pill.

"This medication is extremely harmful and I would not recommend it to anyone. I had extreme pain in my abdomen, shortness of breath, heart palpations, aches in muscles, brain fog, hair loss, flu like symptoms. I contribute some of it to the fact that I eat a very low cholesterol diet. if you eat a clean diet beware - there will be no cholesterol in your blood and the med will attack your system.",4,1,1
I had no idea till I read these reviews that all the muscle pain and weakness is likely caused by this drug. Sometimes when I stand up my legs feel so weak I grab on to things. A friend kept telling me it was bad. Gonna go off.,5,1,1

Results from usage not effective,5,2,3
I've been taking this drug for about five years after switching from another statin drug. After a few months I began to develop pain in my hips.  My doctor suggested I begin taking CO-Q10 which provided some relief.  After a year or so I began taking ubiquinol (a more effective form of CO-Q10) at 100mg per day. This has reduced the hip pain to almost nothing.  I have been taking the ubiquinol with simvastin for the past three years with no major pain or other side effects.  The simvastatin has reduced my cholesterol and triglyceride levels markedly.,5,3,4
I have been on this for a long time and during which I have seen the aches and pains and headaches and weight gain noted by many here during this time. I am just stopping this thing cold turkey. it was my 90 year old Mom that told me she had heard this was no good and did nothig. Well the side affects are enough for me to drop it! Glad I came here to confirm what my Mom mentioned.,5,1,1
"I am diabetic and don't have high cholesterol but my Dr. put me on simvastatin to ""help protect my kidneys"". I have no idea if it is helping but when I read other reviews here, I have some of these side effects as well. I am going to wean myself off of this.",3,1,1
"Although this medicine effectively controlled my cholesterol, it caused severe problems related to muscle weakness, joint pain, UTI, overall weakness and borderline AF. I have been off of it and on to a different stain and am experiencing a return to normality regarding the above problems.  It has taken several months to regain my strength with the help of CoQ10 which was also depleted by Simvastatin us.",4,1,4
"Ease of use???? it's a pill... really.... Anyway after about 3 weeks taking 10mg daily at bedtime I first noticed reduction in stamina during my regular exercise, soon after blurred vision, odd head ache, dizziness when turning my head quickly and greatly increased irritability. About the 3 or 4th day after stopping I began to feel good again. My family doctor didn't think it was this medication and requested I resume taking it and after 4 days the same symptoms returned... So, again I discontinued it.  ",5,1,2
"I will not take this medication any more! After a few nights of taking it, I started itching in my back. I had hives on my stomach area and my back. I itch all over but only broke out around my back and stomach area. Finally, I had trouble breathing and could not sleep. Felt like I was being smothered. I refuse to take this medication any longer.  ",1,1,3
"Was prescribed and began taking in October 2012, 10mg daily, before bed. Within 5 days developed a constant low burning pain just under my sternum. Continued to take for another 3 days and the pain progressed in intensity and was radiating into my mid-thoracic spine. I had also been prescribed and taking Metformin during the same time period, so made a primary care appointment, during which the pain became so severe I was transported to the emergency department and kept overnight with x-rays and ct-scan that indicated mild, acute pancreatitis. The pain subsided over a period of a little over a week, when I again began the metformin, but not the simvastatin, and the I continued to feel recovered. About a month later I started a half-dose of the statin again and by the 3rd morning the pain began again, so I told my doctor I would not take the statin again.",5,1,1
"At age 49 (very fit & active)went on 5mg.  In 4 months I developed major neuromuscular problems (entire body spasms, my head didn't feel attached to my spine and fell forward like a newborn baby, numbness, sciatica, inability to raise arms, walk, change clothes, 24/7 pain), hair loss, teeth chipping and literally aged 20+ years.  I quickly went to the doctor and told her I was going off the med because nothing else could explain this acute disorder. She only did blood work-showed nothing and spine x-ray-I've had spinal arthritis for about 30 years, under control with exercise but never had symptoms like this.  I thought I had ALS, MS, etc. Literally took 18 months for pain to diminish-got worse before it got better. Never contemplated suicide but when I could sleep I wished I wouldn't wake up. Took 2 1/2 years  (PT, ibuprofen, my own daily water therapy and vitamin supplementation) to feel somewhat similar to prior statin. First PT and rheumatologist blamed my arthritis and age? (50!-really!!) since they couldn't, and didn't try-no tests, to find an explanation (they wouldn't believe it was the drug). Second PT was fabulous and has even told me that since me the office is more aware of statin poisoning since I was adamant that I had a med reaction (they are seeing many cases of fit individuals having acute unexplained neuromuscular disorders who are on statins-they didn't look at meds prior to me so didn't put 2 and 2 together). Except for PT the medical profession did not help me with this horrific loss of three years of my life - if anything they caused it.  I expended a lot of money on self recovery. This stuff is poison. I wear a bracelet now to ward off the statin pushers. I think I'll take my familial high cholesterol chances. I'm of a mind that the high cholesterol piece is a scam - just as many people with low cholesterol have heart attacks and strokes as high - I haven't found research that clearly shows causation. Healthy lifestyle makes more sense to me! ",5,1,1
"started medication 3 weeks ago;   experienced increasing back and abdominal pain, anxiety, thight cramps, weight gain;  pain increased to acute level when I contacted physician;  was told to discontinue for 2 weeks then restart to see if symptoms disappear then reappear again;  two days since last dose,  back pain diminishing, anxiety gone, first day pain free!   I will NOT restart this medication...........I am certain it has caused all my symptons, which were non existent until I started medication.",3,3,3

"I having been taking Simvastatin 40mg for about three years after being switched from another statin drug.  After starting, I began to notice hip pain, weakness in my legs and general lethargy after a few weeks.  I complained to my Dr. and he suggested I try CoQ10 to see if that would help.  It made a big difference, and I now have minimal, if any, side effect effects.  I now take 50mg Ubiquinol twice a day (available from Puritan's Pride)and that working well.  Ubiquinol is a more effective form of CoQ10. It costs about $30 per month, but worth it.",5,4,4

I am a retired MD and self prescribed simvastatin 20 mg.qd.  My total cholesterol was 200 mg/dl.  On the drug it went down to 149mg./dl.  I developed breast tenderness and some gynecomastia which is a reported possible side effect.  A lot of further study by me was an eye opener.  The whole paradigm of cholesterol's role in hear disease is wrong.  The USDA's diet pyramid is wrong and carbs and insulin are the culprits.  What a national disaster this has been.,4,1,1
Developed male gynecomastia.,4,1,2
I started taking the medication in November 2012 at 20MGs. Total Cholesterol 249 LDL 163 HDL 60 Triglycerides 130. Currently my numbers are in February 2014 Total Cholesterol 161 LDL 82 HDL 59 Triglycerides 98. I made many diet changes and more exercise. I am now taking 10mgs and have had no side affects.

"After 5 months of taking only a minimum dosage 5 mg Mon, Wed and Fri.I started to get the same muscle weakness that I did when i tried Crestor. I'm not trying anymore statin. Even with this low dose, it did reduce my LDL and raise the HDL and lower trig.  But it's just not for me.",3,3,3
"This medication for me has been terribly bad.  Not only did I experience and large loss of strength in my entire body, physically after 3 and a half month I can see the physical muscle loss. I deal with an autoimmune condition and I thought it was rearing its head with force. I am of small stature and 145lbs. I hurt so bad every morning and experienced nausea throughout the day. The pain at time would come in constant WAVES, which would give me a little relief between. But generally speaking the pains and aches are a constant companion. Appetite would come and go. Mind fog, unstable on my feet at times. Dropping things out of my hands. Increased joint pain. Hips were really weak and hurt. Itchy skin and hands. Restless legs. Depression. Recently a trip to the ER for Angina.  All this after my triple by pass last July. Whether or not the drug IS effective to the MEDICAL and PHARMACY WORLD, in my mind body and soul, it can kill. I can not imagine where I would be in a year on the drug! I hope I have not done damage of other parts of my body, including my liver, stomach and brain. Its only been a couple days off the med and I'm feeling better today. ",5,1,1

"Reduced cholesterol amazingly well - but after 3 months on just 20mg, I was suddenly hit with joint stiffness, spasms & swelling progressing over 3 days, chills & very nasty spreading rash - fortunately the rash is not generally itchy.

"I had a heart attack in 2010.  I never had high cholesterol, was never obese, had diabetes - nothing.  The cardiologist was puzzled as to the cause of it.  My case was submitted to a research group for study.  They put me on this drug after a heart attack as part of the ""cardiac cocktail"".  Immediately I felt sluggish and sore, irritable and tense.  After two years of fighting with the doctors, they decided I was allergic to it.  I have lost my cognitive ability (I am an analyst and my memory is shot - which killed my career), I also now have diabetes and neuropathy in my feet and hands, and cannot obtain an erection since starting it. I feel worse now than at the time of the heart attack.  I would rather go through constant pain of a heart attack than how I feel now.  This isn't the miracle drug they advertise. I am only 50 years old, I shouldn't feel this bad.",1,1,1

"my chol was about 230 and pretty high triglycerides. I used to take 10 mg crestor but as a non generic it got too expensive. I was put on 80 mg of simvastatin ,it worked good but then a warning came out on 80mg so wen down to 40 mg. It still works good, my chol went down to 173 but my trigl's are still somewhat high but not as high as without it.  I am a little concerned about this new thing out there saying it raises chance of diabetes cause my mother had that.  BUt so far my sugar tests have been Ok but a little on the border according to the Dr, he told me to watch  the breads and pasta and juices too. anywau, I heard that Pravachol is better on the diabetes risk, I read the reviews on that and was surprised to see so many people with problems taking Pravochol.  Hard to say, but all in all simvastatin has been Ok, I am almost 60 and no heart attack and I bike a lot also. Biking is very good for the heart. ",5,4,4
Lowering cholestrol. Unecessary.,3,1,3
"Have taken this for 1 1/2 years and believe it has caused lethargy, brain fog, hair loss, stomach problems and depression. Dr. does not agree, but I have come off it and will not take another statin drug. Will try other measures,as I feel this medicine is poison in my system. For everyone having muscle pain, have your Dr. check your vitamin D levels. Mine have been low for years and I take a natural vitamin D supplement as suggested by my Dr. I believe this is why I never had muscle pain while on this statin drug. This is amazing, as it seems to be the number 1 complaint; however, there may be unfelt and unseen muscle or liver damage that I am unaware of.",4,1,4
"I am 64 and was put on this medication after I had quadruple bypass on my 60th b-day. This has to be the worst med I have ever taken. This drug left me with severe muscle aches and pains, joint pains, keratosis, severe skin problems on my feet. I was feeling like I was 104 and almost wishing to go home to GOD. I stopped taking this drug about 6 weeks ago. My muscle aches and pains are gone, the keratosis are all disappearing, my feet are almost normal. The irony of it all is that my numbers for cholesterol prior to my surgery and almost 4 years later are almost identical. The only real good from this drug it that it lowered my triglycerides. This drug is dangerous and should be banned.",2,1,2
OK for lowering cholesterol May be causing muscle weakness - have taken it for over four years.,4,1,4
no side effect so far.,5,5,5

"This medication brought my numbers down dramatically.  On the negative side, my short term memory was getting uncomfortably bad to the point I thought maybe it was the beginning of dementia.  After stopping for three months, my memory has improved dramatically.  I also suffered from severe leg cramps at night while sleeping.  I exercise regularly, watch my diet carefully, and enjoy great health otherwise.",2,2,4
I have been using it for a year. It has lower my cholesterol to a normal level. I still have to loose weight to get off the medication.,4,5,5

"I have high cholesterol and triglyceride levels for which I have been taking simvastatin and fenofibrate. I have lupus and therefor get joint and muscle pains. I went to a different pharmacist today who advised me that using these 2 drugs together has caused many side effects. She also said simvastatin by itself is causing many side effects to her customers. I went to the Doc today complaining of muscle and joint pain, weakness, sweating and memory issues. He could not find the cause. I wish I knew about the side effects before I went to the doc I will try to go off the drug for 2 weeks and see what happens.  ",4,2,2
"I am sorry but this medication in my opinion is not safe enough to be out on the market, I am 39 and I was moving around fine, my total cholesterol was 183, umm i guess the bad hdl was a lil high , so my idiot of a doctor put me on this medication, not even giving me a chance to 2 do the eating right w/ exercise to get it better, long story short, i NEVER! been in so much pain in my life. every muscle, joint, from my head to my toes hurt. I couldn't even get out of bed. I went back to my doctors and low and behold my doctor had been fired. wonder why?? I would never ever suggest this drug to anyone, I would rather die of a heart attack/clogged arteries then ever put this medication back into my body, as a matter of fact it scared me so much I don't want to take another pill in my life, even if it is to save my life. I am have been on it only a week or two and now that I stopped some things are fading slowly, but I still have pain and it's mostly at night time now. I totally hate doctors now, this drug seriously traumatized me. don't take it.!!!!!!!!!!!",5,1,1

I have had no significant problems after taking this drug for the last 6 months.  I only take 20 mg a day.  Minor aches and pains but since I already have arthritis it doesn't seem to be a problem.,5,5,5

Serious muscle pain in the calves of both legs.  Cholesterol has been controlled effectively but not worth the benefit due to the muscle soreness.,4,1,4
Severe muscle and joint pain. Hurts to do anything,5,1,5
after thinking that i was slowly dying from some strange disorder i realized that my slowly progressive severe muscle and joint aches and strange tingling and burning sensations and slow loss of muscle function could definatly be caused by the simvastion i have been taking for a year and a half . i am quitting it immediately and hope that i can return to being 66 and not feeling like i am 99 like i do right now !,3,1,3
"I have been taking Simvastin for at least 6-8 years, and have had elbow, wrist and knee pain for the last 4-5 years, as well as chronic neck pain, which I now think this drug caused.  I have COPD also, and it seems to have worsened.  My chest feels heavier and heavier.  I finally went off it on my own (have not told the doctor yet) and my joint pain has definitely improved.  I also have been extremely fatigued and ""fuzzy"" headed for so long I can't even remember, and this symptom seems to be disappearing also.  I'm not going to tell the doctor until my next cholesterol level check.  I now think this medication may have instigated some skin bumps which are pre-cancerous.  I think it's a terrible drug.  I'll take my chances with high cholesterol, and will continue exercising 4-5 times a week and stay on a healthy diet.  The pain this medication probably caused is not worth a lower cholesterol count.  ",1,1,3

"My doctor put me on Simvastatin one week ago, and I feel like I am getting the same symptoms I had when I was on Prevastatin.  On Prevastatin I felt weak, achy joints, very achy feet and legs...so I stopped taking it cold-turkey and I started feeling 'normal' 2-3 weeks later.  But now that I'm on Simvastatin I'm beginning to feel some of the familiar achy feelings returning, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to stop taking this too.",3,1,1

I really did not relate this to the drug, then one day someone said they had got off the drug and it helped clear their mind. Well I decided to stop taking it and I feel so much better.

I have been on this medication (Zocor/Simvastin) many years since I had a heart attack.  I have found it very effective in reducing my blood cholesterol level to an acceptable range.  If I have had any side effects I have not been able to attribute any to this medication.  I saw another comment that diabetics should not be on this medicine.  I am a diabetic and my doctor is aware of this as he treats me for both conditions.  The medications I am on have been reviewed recently by a endocrinologist specializing in treating diabetes and neither one has indicated there is any problem with this medication.,5,5,5

I took simvastatin for 5 years because insurance would not cover lipitor. During the 5 years on this drug I experienced muscle cramps and aches and pains not attributable to exercise. I basically felt like I had fibromyalgia every time I would see an ad for Lyrica I thought that sounds like me. Although this medication lowered my cholesterol and improved my overall lipid numbers the side effects were bad. When Lipitor became available as a generic I switched back and within a couple of weeks my general overall achiness was gone and the muscle cramps were as well. I will never take simvastatin again regardless of what insurance will cover.,1,1,4

Always tired, and now my function in my left arm and hand still hasn't been restored despite stopping the drug 2 months ago. Been to a neurologist, had an MRI,ETC.. Dr's don't know what happened, but both say it wasn't the statin. The statin is the only thing that I changed in my life. I will never take one again. I am only 50, but felt as if I was 85!!

Super itchy and weeps when I scratch it.  Stopping the drug.  Only 2 days and the rash seems to be not as itchy.  I'll deal with diet and exercise instead of this pill. No more statins for me.,5,1,4
"I was prescribed 80mg. Simvasatin. It seemed to do the job and I didn't notice side effects at first.  About 6 months later I felt like I was in a fog. I passed out, hitting my head, went to hospital for stitches. Heart, brain, blood tests didn't show anything wrong. Felt awful, afraid to go out for fear of passing out again. 3 months after that I got muscle cramps in my leg and my shoulder hurt so much, I could hardly comb my hair.  I saw a report on tv about dangers of taking 80 mg simvasatin. I stopped taking it because of the muscle problems.  They eased and to my surprise, the fogginess I felt lifted also.  I still don't feel I have strength back in my muscles.  During this time I was in the hospital twice and doctors kept telling me that my medications were not causing this.  ",5,1,5
"I had previous sensitivity to statin drugs, but after 7 years my cardioligist wanted me to try Simvustatin. Normal dose is 40-80 mg daily. He started me on 5 mg and the only side effect was a slight itching. So he increased me to 10 mg. after three weeks I developed significant muscle pin nd joint spin. Worst of all, I developed intolerable itching from head to toe; eyes, ears, nostrils---everywhere including my back and stomach itched like no tomorrow. I'd rather be dead than try to tolerate this terrible it. I stopped the drug on Sunday night, Apriln1, 2012---the next day the itching completely disappeared, never returned, the pains disappeared as well. This is the worst drug I ever took. Even when I was taking it, my cholesterol nd triglycerides INCREASED. Do yourself a big favor and try something else. Today my doctor prescribed 5mg Crestor. I'll let you know how it works in a month.",5,1,1

"I'm now on Simvastatin (last three months) after being on Lovastatin for a year. The latter was so debilitating, I stopped taking it.  Tryglicerides shot way up.    I'm also disgusted with Simvastatin and ten days ago started taking half doses.  I could not walk any longer, right shoulder pain, extreme leg fatigue, and I've gained 15-20 pounds although my diet is almost perfect 'recommended'.  I can't excersize, I can't even even go grocery shopping.  These statins besides turning me into almost an invalid, have caused memory and congnitive issues that have essentially changed my personality completely.  There are other side effects, but I can live with those.    I'm comfortable with the normal progression of aging, and expect as I age to be able to do less...but I did not expect to become 'elderly' virtually overnight.    Although the muscle weakness and pain is supposedly a rare side effect, I have recently discovered that two good friends (in different countries) and my ex-husband have completely stopped taking them...in his case, he had to completely give up playing golf which is his passion.    They have all decided, as have I...that they are just not worth taking, even if they do work.  All four of us had side effects that forced us to completely surrender the lifestyles we were living.  Besides the golf thing, one friend had to quit working, another invested in a scooter thing...and I have no life anymore.  I get nothing done and every time you turn around...I'm napping.    I do not know if suddenly stopping the Lovastatin caused a rebound effect making the tryglicerides shoot way up, so I'm weaning myself off of Simvastatin.  Regardless...I'm not taking statins anymore.  But I'm wondering how many folks have also refused to take them, and stopped doing so.  In my case, everyone but one person I know have stopped except for one who does not appear to have any side effects from Simvastatin.  My mother (85) who is more mobile then I am.",5,1,2

Stop the drug for a month and see what happens. Well I have been off it for 16 days and my back has all but quit hurting and the muscle ache in my forearms is going away also. This stuff is poison. Will not be going back on it.",4,1,4

I was sent to a sports medicine doctor that said it was a frozen shoulder and gave me exercises to do. Not working and now I am having the same pain in my right shoulder. Coinsidence, I don't think so. I am also having pain in my right back muscle near my kidney. I thought I pulled a muscle but it comes and goes. I am tired all the time, and thought all of the hot flashes and night sweats were due to menopause from stopping my primerin. But these systoms are continuous and dibilitating. I am urinating less and a darker color and odor. After reading all of the comments on this website I have called my doctor and I AM taking myself off of this medicine! I just hope I am not too late.

Found out Fish oil, flaxseed oil, red yeast rice,garlic, proper diet and exercise are probably best way to go.Also good multi-vitamin, but no extremes on vitamins.

Should always try to take natural derived drugs and no synthethics either.",4,1,2

"I believe there are people who just cannot tolerate statins.  I'm one of them.  I took simvastain in a low dose and it nearly crippled me.  My legs grew weak and my right hip had such pain after taking the medication for just about 2 months.  I got up one morning and had to hold on to a wall to walk.  I had read all the warnings and knew this had to be the problem.  Doctor disagreed of course, but pain and weakness went away.  However, I have been left with a hip joint that ""cracks"" when I walk.  I started taking a non-statin called fenofibrate and started the exact same symptoms in my left arm.  Lost all strength in my bicep and couldn't lift a coffee cup.  Doctor telling me it is arthritis.  I have no history of arthritis and when I stopped the medication, most strenth returned.  Still have severe pain in the shoulder joint on occasion - and for no real reason when I pick up something.  I have also read that the ""mix"" of a cholesterol drug (not necessarily a statin) with other meds you might be taking can cause problems.  I'm now thiking that may be the issue with me and am shopping for a new doctor.  Give me another 10 years of life with low cholesterol and dealing with not being able to function normally, or 1 or 2 good years feeling ""normal"" - I'll take the 1 or 2 good years thank you very much.

"Statins damaged my lungs (healthy lungs Nov 1994; fibrosis all four lobes and an area which looked like possible cancer - which it wasn't -on Xray ten months later). Quit statins shortly afterward; don't know why. Was off statins for many years because I traced my peripheral neuropathy to the same time period as the lung damage. No change in lung condition for years. Put on Simvastatin May 2009; May 2010, lungs much worse than before after being unchanged for a long time. Now permanently off statins.  Have researched what the cell biologists say about statins and it isn't favorable. Should have been taking at least 400 mg of CoQ10 while on Simvastatin, but that would only have helped me avoid the heart damage and additional lung damage the Simvastatin caused; the stirring up of a gene called Atrogin-1 is responsible for the leg muscle cramps I had while on the Simvastatin and the muscle weakness I still have. Wild horses wouldn't induce me to recommend statins to anybody - especially not a lipophilic statin like Simvastatin! Dangerous. By the way, interesting that the blog lines for people damaged by statins are many and long, over 400 documented deaths from statins 1997-2004 have been recorded - and yet every piece of statin research (mostly paid for by drug companies) says Simvastatin and other statins  are ""safe"" or ""mostly safe"": doesn't this strike you as quite interesting? Also, research by cell biologists is now coming out saying that cholesterol isn't even the problem - but of course the drug companies can't put the Mediterranean diet in a capsule and sell it for a high price, or exercise, or a serene outlook on life, while they can put statins in a pill and sell them for plenty - and easy to scare people into thinking they need to take them. However, don't drop your statin on a moment's notice: you have to come off it gradually or risk serious harm to yourself. It takes 6 months for your body to adjust to no statin anyhow, so take your time coming off. ",5,1,5

"I have been taking this medicine for 6 mths now. While on this medication, I felt pain in my arms and in my legs, and occasional pain in my chest.I also felt more tired than normal. I chalked it up to possible anxiety, however, I wasn't aware of anything that would cause anxiety. I ran out of this medicine two months ago, and the doctors office couldn't get me in for over a month. I just started taking this medicine again this evening, and noticed pain in my chest as well as my arms. I haven't had this pain in awhile. I didn't realize that this medication was causing these symptoms. I will be calling the doctors office Monday morning for sure. It is not worth the muscle pain and feeling exhausted all the time.",5,1,2

After two months of 10mg due to cost of Lipitor and no need to improve HDl level this was prescribed. After one month liver function was checked as OK. Now it is being realised that greatly increased rate of memory loss is occuring with short term being seriously affected.  This did not occur with Lipitor. Also there is an increased level of diarhea and some muscle weakness. Time to change back to Lipitor!!,3,2,4
"I was previously on Vitorin and leg weakness was so severe sometimes I couldn't walk.  Doctor started me on Simvastatin.  Been taking it for a couple of years.  Muscle weakness is still present but not as bad.  Complaints to my PCP have been ignored.  Questions about this drug not answered.  I will be looking for a natural way to lower my cholesterol.  Ironic that exercise is recommended along with this drug but muscle pain and weakness keeps me from climbing stairs, walking, pretty much any form of exercise.",5,3,3

I do follow Doctor's advise - No salty and fatty foods, and  work 30-minutes daily, I feel obsolutely healty. I cheat sometimes by carrying about 10 pounds of groceries, my wife hated me for cheating like this so I stopped cheating when I mentioned that I felt pain on my back below the shoulders, sometimes felt sour on my chest left side. She reminded me I should NOT carry weights during my 30-Minutes walk. They seems lite, but for a 1-mile walk, that is very dangerous, it could create problems for the Stents. Agreed",5,5,5
"This medication did work to lower both my bad cholesterol and my triglycerides and it was easy to take. I took this medication for almost 2 years and had chest pains that would wake me up at night, also leg cramps so severe it was difficult to walk. Ask my doctor if this could be from the medication he advised that it wasn't and ordered venograms and arteriograms of both legs and all the while told me to continue taking the medication. Venograms and ateriograms all came back normal. Was told to continue to take medication. Finally, when the day came that I could barely walk do to the muscle cramping in both calves, stopped taking simvastatin. Within 3 days starting feeling better, stopped having cramps in my legs and no longer had chest pains. Switched doctors also. If your doctor will not listen to your symptoms, stop taking the medication and find a new doctor.",5,1,5

But it didnt go away. I got to the point I could barly get out of a chair or walk. I looked this medecine up on this web site..thank God! I have been off it for 3 days and am starting to feel alittle better. My chloresteral was only 100 anyway..I will not take another drug for this. I fear almost all drugs now.

Even when I would get up during the nite to use the restroom my heart would start racing.  I couldn't believe it.  I truly thought of calling my dr. last week and asking for an EKG I felt like i was going to have a heart attack.  I did  not take this med. last night before going to bed and today i have had NO rapid heart beats at all!!  i plan to call my dr. tomorrow and let him know the side effect i had.

Overall painless,5,4,4
terrible side effects,1,1,1
I was prescribed this drug for Hig Cholesterol.  I took it for about 4 weeks with no side affects whatsoever. Then all of a sudden I had a body rash that was unbearable.  I wasn't expecting this and looked up possible side affects and there it was.  Now taking Crestor.  I've only been on for a week but concerned.  We will see.,5,1,1
My numbers were up in 2008 was put on Vytorin 3 months later numbers way down. Made changes in diet  and exercise. I slowly weaned myself off but started again lately and couldn't understand why I had unexplained weight gain. My knees and feet and then my hips began aching. I figured it was stress of extra weight but then I started the generic simvastatin and was having terrible cramps in my legs especially the insides of my thighs. I also have achy feeling between my shoulders. Decided to look it up and saw all these people with the same problems. I will wean myself off again and go back to omega 3 and try cholest off. Hopefully my workouts will improve also. (kickboxing and Zumba. Probably more benefits and less side effects. This other stuff is scary.,4,3,5
I had a heart attack in May 2010 This was one of the new drugs I was put on to avoid another heart attack. I have had almost every symptom listed as side affects. This drug is very bad. I have stopped taking it after 9 mos on it and many trips to emergency room. I just pray things get better now.,5,1,4
"I could not tolerate Lipitor or Crestor so started Simvastatin (10 moving to 20mg over time.I had improved cholesterol scores but not tryglercides. Muscles hurt too but did not attribute that to medicen. Then I had a pancreatitis attack. Since there is a small chance that was caused in part by Simvastatin, I am now off the drug. Never will go on it again.",5,2,3
"I was started on simvastatin in the hospital after a complete blockage of my right coronary artery which was relieved by angioplasty and a stent. In the beginning I didn't notice any side effects from the 40 mg. dose. It lowered my total cholesterol level from 301 to 147 which was great!. After 10 months it went back up to 201 which was probably due to my bad diet. So the doctors (both family doctor and cardiologist) recommended upping the dosage to the maximum of 80 mg. Immediately I started having muscle spasisms in my back that were so bad I was leaning sideways when I stood up to relieve the pain. Then I noticed pain in my left knee where I had never had any in my life. I had been experiencing this pain on and off for several months but attributed it to switching to a lower-riding vehicle and the manner in which I put weight on that knee when I got out of it. Finally, right after I started the higher dosage of Simvastatin I started experiencing shooting pain in my right upper arm when I reached for things behind me. Then I noticed that the range of movement of my right arm which I had never had any problems with before was about 60% of what it was previously. After an MRI scan was done I was diagnosed with a ""frozen shoulder"". I have been doing some exercises to try to fix my back,knee and shoulder pain by strengthening surrounding muscles and stretching the tendons in my right shoulder which have helped quite a bit, especially my lower back and left knee pain. However, now I limit what I do considerably to avoid causing any more pain or muscle spasisms which has diminished my quality of life tremendously. I am going to try the CoQ10 to see if that helps and, if not, then I am going off Simvastatin and just try to improve my diet by limiting my intake of sugar and saturated fat.",4,1,4

"I wanted to try a generic to cut costs on my cholesterol med.

"Took 20mg for a few days, forgot pill one night and took the next morning.  Felt pain and tightness around my heart.  Called Dr. wanted me into ER for tests.  All tests were good.

"Luckily I have a doctor's appointment in 2 days. The first night I started taking 40 mg my legs would not stop tingling. They tingle all day. I even got a charley horse the other night and now my knee hurts. All this is just from being on this medicine for 3 weeks. If I cut the pill in half, the problems are greatly reduced. My younger sister is on Lovastatin and has no side effects, but the reviews from others on that drug are just as ugly as Simvastatin. Statins are awful drugs.",4,1,4

I take it at night and every night my whole body ached. I could not get comfortable no matter how I laid. When I got up in the morning I was so stiff I could hardly walk and lately my back hurt so bad. I had trouble breathing without pain. I stopped a couple of days ago and it has all eased up.

"I have been taking this medication for over 6 months.  My hair starting breaking off on the ends and coming out really bad.  I didn't think about the medicine could be causing this until recently.

I do have numbness and tingling in my hands sometimes when I wake up.  I didn't attribute any of this to this medication until reading all of the reviews and looking at the side effects on the web site.  My dosage is 20mg daily.  I go to the doctor for my checkup next week and I plan to address this subject at that visit.  My cholesterol numbers have dropped considerably (way below 200), I could never get my numbers below 240 something before I started taking this medicine.

"I have used Simvastatin for 17 years. It has effectively reduced my high cholesterol. In addition, I was also taking taking Gemfifrozil to lower my tryglicerides which were over 1400 when I started. The combination allowed me to lower LDL to below 70 and triglicerides to below 40. I quit Gemfib after a few years (slowly!) and have restarted it just to tweak my triglicerides.

"My father started taking this drug after a minor heart attack at the end of July. He has also a chronic disease of the heart called congestive heart failure (chf). About 15 days after been released from the hospital he started complaining about muscle pain, shortness of breath, weakness, and nervousness. We thought it was because of his heart failure, but then when he went to see his Doctor again the muscle pain had grown severe, he was hospitalized again to get the effects of the Simvastatin out of his system. The problem now is that to do that they put fluids in his body to clean the medicine out and because of his CHF his heart and lungs are full with fluids that do not let him breath well and he has not been able to sleep for almost 5 days even after taking a sleeping pill at night. He was following a very strict diet before and during the time that he was taking the Simvstatin, but at the end I think the side effects were not worth the pill.",2,1,2

Thanks goodness I did some research and also found this Web, MD page and read so many of the comments. It was looking at myself in the mirror. I finally stopped taking it about a week and half ago and am starting to feel a little better. My doctor agreed that I should stop taking it also.

"I am writting this to let others know it is possible to take simvastatin for a long period of time and out of the blue start experiencing problems. I've taken this med for close to two years. My cholesterol went from 289 to 145 within weeks, other numbers looked great too. No side effects at all. Thought I was home free. But no such luck. The past two months one thing after another, stomach problems, back aches, pain in my upper thigh, now my arms hurt just to blow dry my hair. Speaking of which, emailed my Dr. last month asking why my hair would be falling out. Her response was normal aging. I could go on and on. Finally it dawned on me, maybe the statin drug could have something to do with all these crazy things. Went to this web site and sure got my answer. Way too many others have same problems to be coincidental. After another email my Dr. tells me to immediately stop taking it and come in for lab work. So the onset of side effects don't always happen right away. I was so happy with the way it worked but guess I will have to resort to the old fashioned method (diet and excercise). Can't deal with the pain.",5,2,5
"This medication lowered my cholesterol BUT within 6 months felt like my body had no support.  Now, I've begun to understand why. Muscle's support your skeleton. Muscle & joint severe pain.  Tired,  most of the time, feel groggy. My doctor is thrilled BUT I hate this medicine.  The side effects do not justify the lower LDL levels.  ",4,1,3
"My husband has been on this drug since he went into sudden cardiac arrest in Feb.  Although his cholesterol was within the high normal range (below 200) his doctor prescribed it to prevent heart attacks.  Since that time, he has experienced ringing in his ears, headaches and fatigue. After 60 days, his cholesterol was exactly the same.",5,1,1

"Started on 10mg Simvastatin 5 yrs ago prior to successful prostate ca surgery. My MD upped the dosage to 20 mg in January. I also have been taking 2000mg Flax oil, 2000mg Salmon oil, 800mg VitE, and a multivit. No side effects, and I'm active , go sailing, go to the gym, cardio and weights, eat soy products primarily ( not a vegan, though). So I noticed some patches of light skin (I'm cauc, but tan well) on my neck and a small area on my chin- looks like mild vitiligo---thought it was razor burn, but I wonder if it had anything to do with the increase in the statin, which is the only med changed in 5 yrs, I'm 64, male and in good health.Anybody experience anything similar with this drug and /or interactions with Omegas 3 supplements?   ",5,4,5

"I had been on this drug for about six months, and really didn't notice anything. I got contacts, started coloring the gray, and decided to start walking three to five miles a day.  I got debilitating ""charleyhorses"", severe leg cramps in my calves. I would literally have to roll out of bed, and put my feet on the floor to get rid of the cramps.  I ran out of simvastatin, and the cramps stopped before I could get another refill.  I have gained 20 pounds, because I haven't exercised in about three weeks and haven't taken my pills.  I go to my doctor's tomorrow.  A friend suggested WebMD. Thanks, I didn't know a lot of other people who were taking this drug also were getting calf cramps.",5,2,5
"I started taking this drug about 6-7 months ago. Since that time, I developed a horrible pain in my left shoulder and ended up with frozen shoulder and many hours of physical therapy. I even had a manipulation done in the hospital to release my shoulder. I read user reviews on another website and many of the people also had frozen shoulder that were taking this drug. I stopped taking this pill 2 days ago and my shoulder hurts a lot less already! This drug needs to be removed from the market or doctors need to know that frozen shoulder is a SERIOUS side effect of this medication!",5,1,2
"My cholesterol went down 90 points.  It works but I had terrible shooting pains.  Like others, I thought it was from yoga or another exercise.  When it got worse rather than better I realized it was from the pills.  My MD wasn't the least bit surprised that I quit taking them.",5,1,5

"I have taken Lipitor for years with no side effects.  Insurance changed and does not cover Lipitor, thus my MD started me on Simvastatin.  I have taken it for 2 weeks and am experiencing horrible joint pain, muscle cramps in thighs, calfs, upper arms, lower back and neck.  I have headaches every afternoon and in the mornings the last 3 days.  The joint pain and muscle cramps have made sleep difficult and pain severe when I change positions from lying down or sitting to standing and trying to walk.  Walking is painful and stairs are almost impossible.  I feel like I've aged 50 years in 2 weeks.  Additionally, my blood pressure has increased dramatically in the past 2 weeks.  I have taken BP meds for the past 8 years and recently was taken off by my MD as my pressure was doing so well.  I have arthritis that I used to take Motrin for twice a day, but with a new nutritional supplement that includes Omega 3s and fish oil, I have not required any Motrin for over a month.  Since I started Simvastatin, all of the gains with BP and arthritis have been negated and I feel horrible.  I've called my doctor and will see him tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I will not be taking this medication again!!",1,1,1
"Took 1 pill before bed - within an hour I developed a terrible itching - didn't sleep at all (not like me).  Got up early with stomach pains, weakness all over, headache, tingling - couldn't pick up my morning pill due fingers being numb.  Vision was blurry - it felt like an asthma attack.  My skin was on fire and hands trembled.  Needless to say I'm taking another pill and have left a message for the nurse.  Other statins gave me severe chest pains, but this is terrible.  Yes my cholesterol is high (LDL 206, HDL 65) but I'd rather take my chances than live with these horrible side effects.",5,1,1

After starting this drug I started to have cramps in my calf's and feet.  I also have Crohn's Disease and on med's for it.  I am having problems with the Crohn's and it won't go into remission.  My Doctor advised me to go off of the simvistatin as it could be causing me problems.  I did so and it helped alot.  It is not the answer to my problems with Crohns but definately helped me.  I was changed over to Niacin for the high cholesterol but having the bad flush and rash and it lasting for a couple of hours.  Not sure what to do next!,5,1,5

within 3 weeks i have severe pain from my hips down to my calfs. had i known this could be a side effect i would have stopped sooner. i can't imagine a patient not being able to express themselves having to continue this medication. i had no idea this was not from the exercize i was doing. what are we doing to our old people who can't express what they are feeling??????,5,1,1
"By the third day on 10 mg I itched all over and had neck/shoulder pain, foot/ankle pain and low back pain.  Gave it up when I fell while out trying to walk it off.  I stopped taking for a week and started again on 1/2 tab.  That one dose was worse than the previous three doses.  This time with shaking chills, a brain-busting headache, and stomach cramps with diarrhea within 2 hours. All of this having been on CoQ10 for the 4 months before starting.  My numbers were all within normal ranges, but the doc said over 60 everybody needs a statin.  The study says statins improve survival rates.  If I had to survive even one extra day feeling like that I'd do myself in today.  This one is off my shelf!!!  Nobody 'survives' this life anyhow and I chose to survive my time feeling good.",2,1,1
"I stopped taking simvastatin due to very severe pain and weakness in my legs, back pain and aching all over my body, I felt like I aged so much I could hardly walk, I also had a feeling in my heart like it was vibrating and would wake up at night from it. I went off simvastatin in Dec and noticed no improvement, after 3 months my legs were still so bad I was afraid they would never get better, after reading some reviews here I decided to try taking Co Q 10 , Ive been taking 300 mg a day, the cosco kirkland brand and I cant believe the difference I have had imediate improvement and I feel like myself for the first time in along time, I would encourage anyone suffering the effects of this nasty drug to give it a try, it worked wonders for me hope it will for you.",1,5,4

Have been taking for just over a year now.  I had researched statins before I started on them and take 200 mg of Co Q10 daily to prevent side effects.  Haven't had any side effects and my cholestral is 169.  I am dissapointed that I had to find out about side effects prevention on my own; doctors didn't offer any ideas on how to prevent side effects (about taking Co Q10).,5,5,5
"This drug lowered my cholesterol, but I have experienced a severe side effect to simvastatin. I had a physical shortly before retiring. I started taking this drug at that time. During the physical, the optomitrist told me I had a small cataract in my left eye and a spot in my right that was probably the start of a cataract. He went on to say that it would be years before I really had to worry about it.  18 months later, I had hazy vision and went in to have my eyeglass prescription changed. Turns out that the prescription had not changed, but I now have full blown cataracts in both eyes and they have progressed to the point that I need surgery. I read the side effects of statens and the main severe effect is rapid cataract growth. I was 57 years old when I started taking the drug.",3,1,3
"49 Year male, this drug really knocked my bad numbers down and my Dr. was really happy. Had incredible lower back pain that was crippling, when I woke up. Thought old age was catching up, non OTC pain releivers would touch the pain. It took me 4 weeks to finally attribute taking this med at night and the morning pain. Stopped takning and the pain is slowly getting better. ",4,2,4
"I've been on simvastatin for a few years.  Yes, it has lowered my cholestrol, HOWEVER, I have suffered from muscle ache and pain the whole time.  I made no connection tothe drug and attributed it to ""getting old"".  (I'm a very active, in good shape, 61 year  old female) This past week I have been suffering with severe, crushing pain in my legs, hips and lower back.  I thought it was the flu, however, after seven days of terrible pain that would not subside with  any over the counter pain killers I went to my Dr. knowing something was terribly wrong!  After full examination and many questions, he determined that this crushing muscle pain I was experiencing was a reaction to the simvastatin.  I have been off the drug for three days, and still I am in pain. Although it is beginning to subside I continue to have trouble getting up from a sitting position, and feel pain and weakness in my legs while walking, especially up stairs.  Sitting or laying down for more than thirty minutes is extremely painful, relieved somewhat by moving and slowly walking around the house.  I am not a whinner and have always prided myself in the level of activity I enjoy, but I must say that this pain was so severe that it has stopped my dead in my tracks!  I am hoping that I'll be back to normal again within a few days and no permanent damage has been done.  What I do know is that I am going to attempt to control my high cholestrol  with diet and exercise.  THIS Simvastatin is SCARY, SCARY STUFF and I am sooo done with drugs!  ",3,1,3

It lowered my cholesterol significantly. My doctor told me to take co Q 10 supplements along with my dosage.  I have never had any pain or problems reported by others and I have been on it for over a year. I believe that the CoQ 10 supplement has prevented the side effects of pain and stiffness.  ,5,5,5
"When I first start using it(40 mg about a year), it was effective - however, now I have low grade pain/discomfort in mt neck which interfers with my sleep.  This coupled with BP meds (lisinpril 10 mg) has made me fatigued and tired all the time.",3,3,3
"I have been on this medication for about 2 years - my insurance won't pay for any name brand remedies. Have been experiencing severe leg and knee pain on my left side, night sweats and extreme burning on the bottoms of my feet and numbness in my toes. I am also extremely tired all the time. Just went on a trip with 3 of my girlfriends to NYC to see a broadway show, could barely walk the several blocks necessary to get to the various things we wanted to do - we are all about the same age, and I was the only one having difficulties (totally embarassing and painful!). Came to this site to get some honest evaluations from other people using the drug - and I had an ""aha"" moment. Will be discontinuing use immediately and making a DR appt. Need to figure out a better way to deal with this cholesterol! ",4,1,4
Ok so I was on Crestor and that helped my cholesterol but my triglycerides stayed high so Dr put me on simvastatin. After a week I also got muscle weakness and pain felt old tired. I stopped taking it and felt well again in about a week. This stuff is just not worth it!,3,1,2
This medicine worked great to lower my cholesterol but I felt like I was 100 YEARS OLD!!!! I couldn't climb tne stairs to go to bed let alone just stand up from sitting in a chair. I stopped taking it three weeks ago and feel like a new person!!!! I'm still experiencing some muscle pain in my legs at times and my left arm still isn't working quite right but hopefuly soon I will be back to normal. I will never take this medicine again!!!,5,1,5
"I have been taking 40mg Simvastatin for about 3 weeks--after getting off Lipitor due to severe muscle and joint pain.  For the past week and a half I have been experiencing a strange fulness/lightheaded feeling in my head, a shaky feeling in my muscles, dull ache in my kidney area, and very vivid dreams.  I contacted my cardio doctor who suggested I either cut the mg down to 20mg. or to stop the meds completely.  I have decided to stop for 10 - 15 days and see what happens.",5,1,3
"I HATE hearing that generics are the ""same"" as brand name.  They are not.  I was prescribed Simvastaten, instead of Lipator.  Between the high insurance premiums, and prescription co-pays that we pay, I would love to take a generic.  I'm not prone to experiencing side effects from meds, but this one gave me severe muscle pain, and unpredictable weakness in my right arm/shoulder.  I could not lift my right are without a lot of pain.  Sometimes I would go to pick up something that I usually had no trouble picking up, and would drop it from sudden weakness.  My arthritis was also greatly aggravated.  I thought it was the natural progression of the disease, but now, seeing the difference, I'm quite sure the Simvistaten was making the pain much worse.  It took me a year to figure it out.  Talking to friends, and finding that 2 of them had to quit taking this (the only drug that we had taken in common) for the same reason.  What are the odds of 3 out of 3 of us experiencing the same side effect, that they list as ""rare"".  I wonder how many other patients out there are having debilitating pain, and weakness that they can't explain?  It's so simple to fix....just stop taking this drug!  I've been on Lipitor for 3 weeks now, and although there is still some pain, and restricted range of movement, there is definite improvement.  I am afraid that the Simvistaten may have caused some permanent damage, as I never had pain, weakness, or limited flexability before.  The Liptor website offers coupons for one free month co-pay to new patients, and a $10 card towards your monthly co pay after that.  Hope this helps someone out there",4,1,3
"This drug is the most horrible drug that I have ever taken. I had panic attacks, heart palpitations, hair loss, memory loss, severe back and leg pain. No energy. Loss of breath, chest pain , itchy rash,hot flashes. My knees would buckle for no reason and without pain. I thought I was at deaths door until I found out what was causing all these problems. The doctors had me on so many pills to correct the problems that they didn't find the real problem. I found it on WebMd. and I quit immediately taking this drug. I was better in 3 or 4 days. I can live without the side effects of this drug. I have also reported this drug to the FDA. I still have reoccuring symptoms from time to time, but I have been off this drug since Feb. of this year. In other words about a month. I will never take this drug again. ",3,1,2
"I was in so much pain that I could hardly climb the stairs to go to bed.  Felt much better after skipping just one dose however it's been about a year and I still have burning pain in my right thigh which I'm thinking is permanent damage.

Pain lets up some if all I do is lay around for weeks at a time to rest it.  Unable to do any of the fun things that I used to because of the pain.  Has affected my marriage, too.",5,1,3
"Not until my dosage was increased from 10mg to 20mg did I realize the itching might be caused by this medication.

My cholesterol has jumped 80 points since April 2009 and triglycerides ~50 points, while diet and exercise remains essentially the same?  Did I get a placebo instead of the real medication?",4,1,1

My doctor had prescripted 3 per day to be taken at night, I have now been informed that my insurance company will only pay for 1 to be taken a day.

i do not think it has helped me i went from 200 with liptor to 300 with simvast,1,1,1
"Horible experience with this medication.  Burning pain in my thighs, pain in my legs so bad I could barely walk, pain in my back and neck and being woke up at night out of sound sleep with a feeling that my heart was vibrating or buzzing HORRIBLE!!!! I saw 4 different doctors 2 cardiologist and none of them figured it out, stopped taking simvastatin 2 months ago and my numbers went up but my heart feels normal again and body aches are getting better, I would NEVER take this stuff again!",5,1,4
This drug is nasty and should be taken off the market.  I took this drug for 2 months until I was having a hard time walking and had a severe back ache.  I felt like I was 110 years old.  Nothing would alleviate the pain until one day a light bulb went off-its the simvastin.  I quit taking it and 24 hours late the pain was going away.  I would rather live with high cholesterol than not be able to walk or function period.,3,1,2
"I've been taking 10 mg dose for over a year. My cholesterol dropped over 60pts within the first month... even had blood analysis done with Berkley Heart Lab, which showed how my triglycerides, HDL and LDL rates had improved. Was very pleased and satisfied with that. But side effects are painful: the leg pain. Both legs, particularly the calves and feet. Have talked to my DR. She checked for PAD and ruled it out. She has no other explanation except possibly weight. I started working out in a gym to lose weight, leg pain persisted. Quit going to gym. I bought an elliptical machine. Use it daily, leg pain is subsiding only somewhat. Will give it another two months to see if the leg pain goes away. Feels like cramps, or the pain you feel after having a leg cramp. Hard to get up from sitting down position. Walking hurts when I first stand up. Stairs are very difficult for me. I'm only 56 and I'm a school teacher. I think I must look like at 75 year old when I walk down the hall. Have bought arch inserts for my shoes. That helps a little. I'm going to show my doctor this website so she can read the experiences of others on this med.",5,2,4

Was brushed off by Dr. and until finding this site in 2009 thought I was the only one with all these symptoms.I stopped the Simvastatin the very next day and switched to Cholestoff. Took nearly a month for the muscle pain and burning to stop.My last blood test was 190, but I'd eaten a double cheese pizza the night before the test. I'm now making better food choices and I'm pretty sure my results will be even lower this time. I feel better than I have in years.

"I was switched to Simvastatin from Lipitor because Medi-Cal wouldn't pay for Lipitor anymore.  I had been taking it faithfully until I learned that a lady went out of her mind temporarily while on it.  When she was taken off of it, she got a lot better.  I don't know if this is due to the fact that she is in her 90s, or if she can't take statins.  I need to talk to my doctor about this, because it's been a couple months since I took it.  Now that I read other reviews, I think back on the fact that I got a LOT of leg cramps while on this.  I never made the connection with that.",2,2,3

I just started this med (40 mg) last night and all day today I experienced weakness, jitters, muscle aches, joints hurt...could barely take my normal walk.(And I'm in good condition).  Definitely could not do the treadmill.  Called doctor who had me cease taking it.  I guess I don't understand how this could be on the market if so many people (and such an apparent high percentage) have these side effects.  Doctor is giving me some Crestor samples. So now that I have 89 more simvastatin for the trash..I'll have to pay a high price for Crestor (if it works).  Ah, modern medicine.   ",5,1,1

My Dr. downplayed the joint pain as a side effect.  But thanks to many evaluators, this seems to be a common problem.  I am taking myself off this drug and see what happens.",4,1,4

Now I am starting to feel really tired, dizzinest, blurred vsion at times and some pain in wrist. I could not for the life of me figure out why, then I realized it might be the new meds. Decided to check WebMd, sure enough saw others were having some of the same problems. Talked to my doctor and he is asking that I give it a few more weeks to see if the side effects clear and wait for blood work. I will see how it goes, but if it gets worse I am going to stop.",4,3,3

I started noticing that I was sweating excessively and my hair would be soaking wet within 2 minutes. I didn't put two and two together until I started looking into side effects of all my medications and started reading  about Simvastatin. Reading about sweating, nausea, extremely hot flashes, extreme fatigue, increased muscle pain, and hip pain...among other symptoms. I have all of these and thought I was just getting more health issues. I am going to quit this medication starting today! And I hope to God that most, if not all of these horrible symptoms go away!

My doctor put me on 20mg about a year ago to replace a name brand and I started to have stomach pains that just continued to get worse so I stopped taking Simvastatin on my own and the pain stopped. I never told my doctor unitl a later visit and he said that this drug wouldn't cause that so he put me back on it. Within a week the same stomach pain which would keep me up nights and keep me from functioning normally during the day so I dropped it again and I will not go back on it ever. I haven't told my doctor yet but he insist that this can't happen but funny after being off of it for a few days the pain goes away.,2,1,2

"Started taking this medication over three years ago and have experienced severe fatigue, muscle cramps in arms, legs, hips, and neck.  I have also experienced hot flashes and severe insomnia.  In July of 2008, I stopped taking this medication.  In August of 2008, My cholesterol level was 288.  Extremely high!  Knowing the side effects of this medication, and knowing I needed to reduce my cholesterol, I started taking Cholest-Off by Nature Made.  This product contains all natural ingredients including plant sterols to help reduce cholesterol.  The difference with taking Cholest-Off was that I had to take 4 tablets daily with a meal.  I took two with breakfast and two with dinner.  In February of 2009, I went back to my doctor for lipid panel/cholesterol blood tests. When I got the results three days later, I was blown away! My cholesterol level had gone from 288 down to 181.  The Cholest-Off worked beautifully with no side effects!  During this process I changed my diet and started going to the gym at least three times a week.  I still take Cholest-Off and will be tested again in early September of 2009.  My doctor was very happy with the results even though I never told her I stopped taking the Simvastatin.  Had she checked my medical records, she would have seen that I had not refilled my Simvastatin presciption for over six months!  I would advise anyone on cholesterol medication to try Cholest-Off as an alternative to Simvastatin.",5,1,2

Saw a opthamologist last week---that's okay.  Am going to see an orthopedic and liver specialist within the next weeks.  My Alkaline Phosphotase level is still elevated even though I quit taking Simvastatin 2 months ago.  Why did my dr. and the pharmacy not see Lopid as a contra- indication as everything I read lists that? At this point I'm not only angry but also scared.  My new pharmacist said that since this happened I should never again take another statin. (prior to this I had been taking Lipitor with success, but alas I could no longer afford it).  ",1,1,1

It's very disheartening but helpful to read some very similiar comments and now I am convinced that it's the medication. I couldn't pin-point what the problem was and recently shared all my concerns with my Dr. and was taken off the med for a month with her confirming that ALL Cholestrol meds have these side effects. What I cant understand is after being off the med for a few weeks, i'm still experiencing some of the side effects!

I have been taking this med for about 7 months.  One month ago I developed severe hip pain that I really could not pin point an episode of trauma to cause it.  My doc diagnosed it as piriformis syndrome.  The pain is incredible and nothing seems to mitigate the degree of pain.  This web site makes me suspicious of the statin.

"One and half yrs ago I was chg from Zocor to Simvastatin by my insurance co. Zocor worked fine had no problems with it. Recently since I started Simvastatin I have became sleppy all the time, always tired, pain in lower back, legs & hips, walking is painful due pain in my legs and hips.

After taking my 20mg dose at night, I wake up feeling full in my upper stomach I am bloated, sometimes I have diarear, sometimes constapation. Went for tests for stomach yesterday have not got results yet. I have always beleived it was the Simvastatin doings this to me. It is hard for me to do anything around the house my motavation is gone, I don't seem to want to do anything anymore, I guess it is depression too.

"Started Simvastatin 4 months ago. Within 2 months I started having constant muscle pain in my upper arm, but didn't relate it to the medicine. Thought it was muscle strain due to relocating my computer & mouse-- so moved it again & was waiting to see if the pain went away. A month went by with no change so thought maybe I was sleeping wrong on my shoulder & arm-- made a conscious effort to change that.  Still no improvement.  Went into Dr. this week for standard lab work & follow up for high blood pressure, cholesterol & triglycerides. Initial lab work showed a great improvement in both choleserol & triglycerides.  But then I mentioned the muscle pain-- the Dr. examined the arm and told me to stop the Simvastatin immediately and sent me for CPK labwork (awaiting call for those results now).   In the meantime, switched me over to Crestor, and in 3 days I've developed a bad sore throat. I was just thinking allergies until I read the Crestor info today, and now I wonder about that.   Seems like the cure is worse than the disease on many of these meds. :-(",4,1,4
Simvastatin has been very effective for me. My cholesterol was high and this medication has brought it down significantly in the last month I've been taking it. The only side effect it has on me is the loss of hair. For the past (almost) 2 months I've been taking this medication I've lost a lot of hair. It might not be mentioned on this page as a side effect but it is mentioned on my prescription information slip that comes with my medication. So for those who are taking this medication please watch out for loss of hair and contact your physician. ,4,3,4
"I have been on this drug for about 6 years after having blockage in my heart and a stent.  It has kept my cholesterol and triglycerides extremely down.  Works great for what it was prescribed for.  I take every night before bed but after reading other's comments I too have experienced memory loss, sleep problems, aching and itching in my feet and calves at night and itching balls plus reduced sex desire and perfomance.  Also, I found that I have sinus problems and hoarse throat and have been coughing a lot.  I have seen all of the above mentioned by those taking simvastatin.  I may ask my doctor to try something different.",5,4,5
"Started in Jan., 09, didn't know that it was aggravating my bad back, perhaps why none of the treatments for my back worked. In April, Dr. want to double my dosage. Within two weeks, I could barely walk. My knees were killing me, unble to walk without severe pain.  My back was getting worse. My feet and legs were swelling. Everything hurt. My doctor said to cut the dose in half. I refuse. Does this illnes caused by statins ever go away. I do know that it leads to a disease Rhabdomyolysis can even damage you kidneys.

"Sorry to hear so many people are having muscle cramps and memory loss. I just ordered 400mg CoQ-10 to supplement while I try out this statin. I just started using it or any statin for that matter last night. I was prescribed 40mg but I cut them in two to make #60 20mg pills. My lipids have always been off the chart: low HDL, high LDL, high triglycerides, etc. I am a 33 yr old male, 6ft, 190lbs. My problem is not with high cholesterol because it runs in the family with no history of heart disease. I am trying it because I do have fatigue, headaches and possible bronchiectasis (lung scarring caused from possible IgG deficiency leading to mutiple lung infections), and most importantly I might be the person that gets heart disease in the family. I giving the medicine 3 stars to begin with and will take away or add more in 4 weeks. There is a lot of misinformation out there about statins. One thing is true, cholesterol is part of the problem with plaque build up in the arteries. Don't forget that. ",3,3,3

"Where to start. I had been on simvastatin for years, also lisin/hctz. for blood pressure. Never had any problems and they both did their jobs. Then this year I started to exercise every day, and eat better, and I lost 40 pounds.  I mentioned to my dr that I would like to get off of meds as I was healthier now, but he wanted to wait and see, make sure the next few blood tests were good. The end of march, i started having severe constipation, laxatives were hardly helping at all, or they would give some results but not much and seemed like nothing on my own, only with laxatives. I was thinking I had a blockage or something. three weeks into this problem, start getting sharp pains in shoulder blade, right side. Then burning pains in stomach. doctor sent me to have a colonscopy and ultra sound and injection test to have gall bladder checked. both came out fine. this took weeks and I could not exercise like I was, turning down extra hours at work, all kinds of co pays to specialists and tests. My last visit doc said it could be pancreitis, brought on by medicine. sent me for blood, but I stopped medicine that very day. one week goes by, burning stomach stops, end of three weeks, shoulder pain is much less often. I was supposed to go back last week, but I postponed apt to give me more time to see if things were still getting better before paying for more tests. will update in a few weeks.",5,1,4

"I started using Simvastatin because Lipitor was getting too expensive.  I did have muscle pain with Lipitor, reported it to my Doctor, told it was a minor side effect for what it does.  When I started Simvastatin I felt really good.  Then things started:  swelling and painful hands and feet, very tired, painful leg muscles and hips, stomach pain.  I thought it might be the Simvastatin because of all the side effects.  Last week I stopped taking it for five days and I felt great on day four and five;  I started using Simvastatin again on Monday evening - so I've taken two doses (40mg each day) and all my pain and swelling are starting to come back.

I immediately noticed a severe reaction to sun and heat. I have Rosacea and therefore take great care protecting my skin when outdoors, but nothing I do since beginning Simvastatin inhibits my burning when out doors or reddening up inside when the heat is on. I also have begun to perspire even when I am sitting. Any type of activity begins an onset of heavy persperation and facial reddening. I also am not sleeping as well as I did before and plan to ask my physician to switch my back to Lipitor. ",5,1,1

"I tried this drug once and became extremely sick, throwing up for a couple hours and also having diarrhea. I also couldn't sleep after the ordeal. The only other time I became this nauseous and sick was when I had food poisoning several years ago. I took this drug about 3 hours after I ate, not directly with food, which possibly could have been an issue. However, the lable on the drug didn't say to take with food, nor did my phamasist say it was necessary. I also became extremely nauseous when I took Vytorin, with food, but did not get sick, and also became sick when I used another statin, but don't remember which one. This was my third try with a cholesterol drug; all statins or part statin. I read about 50 reviews, and no one seemed to have my experience, but I felt first timers should know this could happen.  I might just have stomach reactions to stations, so if anyone has other medicenes to look into, please let me know. I'll also be speaking to my physician soon.   ",1,1,1

However, I have experienced many of the same bothersome side effects as many of the commenters, eg lower back pain, pain and weakness in my hips, trapezius pain, etc.  I thought it was just me, but many people are complaining of the same issues.

"I've been on several different statins over the past twenty years.  Eventually, my hip and finger joints become intolerably painful.  The doctor has always changed me to a different med or combination drug.  The last was a combination with lisinopril/naicin and I couldn't tolerate the flushing.  I went off, on my own, as my hands had gotten so much more painful.  I did find a time-release naicin in the same dosage as the above med contained and I could tolerate that just fine.  Told the doctor of my action, so she put me on simvastatin.  Within days my finger joints were getting more and more painful.  And just the past few weeks, my hips have become painful whenever I try changing positions in bed.  It should be noted that I am quite fit, working out with a trainer twice a week and treadmilling/walking the other days of the week.  This hip pain disturbs my sleep and my peace of mind.  Anyone else had these problems?",5,1,3
"I started taking this medication when I found out about my high cholesterol.  I'm already taking Tricor but my doctor said I needed this medication too.  OK, I took just one pill; later that same day, I started having diarrhea and I became terribly nauseated.  Wanting to give it a second chance, I took it for the next 2 days; each day the sickness got worse.  I finally quit taking this medication and I will never take it anymore!  I'm calling my doctor because ""WebMD"" said ""if you experience diarrhea and/or get nauseated then notify your doctor immediately and and quit taking these pills.",1,1,1

"I took Simvastatin for 14 days. Before srarting my total cholesterol was over 230. Throughout all of this I was never got a breakdown between teh LDL and HDL. It has been high for over a year and was hard for me to keep it under control. My 2 brothers and my dad have been eating meds. for high cholesterol for years a decided to give it a shot. After 2 weeks of taking one 40 mg tablet at bedtime my cholesterol dropped to 161. Knowing that it dropped over 70 points in two weeks I immediately stopped eating the drug. Hopefully now I can keep my cholesterol in the 160's now by maintaining a proper diet, exercizing properly blah-blah-blah so that I don't have to be prescribed this stuff for a long time. There were some side effects that I read about and was aware of what could happen. What happened with me was muscle aches more than anything almost like I was a bit dehydrated all of the time. Also my liver area felt like it was swollen and my urine got really dark. The only other thing that it hit me with were headaches. Once I stopped the drug the side effects went away pretty quickly. Like I said, I just hope that I have enough will-power to keep living right so that the cholesterol level will remain in the 160's and not get jacked up again.",5,4,5

He developed so much pain (including spasming) in his feet that he could hardly walk and it would keep him awake at night.  (But he did not associate it with the drug).   I had been on a 20 mg dose for a very short time and discontinued it because I had developed numbness in my hands, fatigue, hair loss, significant edema in my lower legs, and increased appetite.   I kept telling him about the things that I had been reading about this drug and he just wasn't willing to discontinue the medication, until he couldn't stand the pain anymore.  Finally, he gave in and stopped taking it.  The pain and spasms have resolved (within 3 days) and have not returned and it has been over 3 weeks since he did it.

"After many months of using this medication and having my doctor increase the dosage, we finally achieved the cholesterol numbers we were targeting.  Unfortunately, about a year after I began using it, I was experiencing significant muscular pain and weakness in my lower back (pain in muscles around my hip too).  I was in significant pain when I sat for more than a few minutes and the pain even affected my ability to sleep and exercise.  This pain came on slowly and steadily got worse over time.  Any physical activity would make the pain even worse.  I had difficulty straightening my back and bending over. My quality of life was terrible and eventually I was moving like an 80+ year old.  It took some time to figure out what was causing the pain because I was working with a spinal specialist and physical therapist and I trusted their judgement.  They asked what medication I was on and were not able to identify this as the cause.  Finally I figured out the cause on my own.  I did not correlate the two for so long becasue I had been on the medication without pain for many months.  Within a day or two of stopping the medication, my back pain began to subside and my strength began to return.  Two week later I feel back to normal.  I will never use this drug again.",3,1,3

Knowing that during this period of time she she has been seeing her physician every 3 months, without a negative report, I attributed her dulling wits, increasing fatigue & loss of mobility to aging.  4 days ago my mother was displaying all of the symptoms of a stroke victim (incoherency, loss of mobility, etc). She had to be rushed to the hospital via ambulance. A cat scan and other test were run and the doctors determined that she did not have a stroke but instead was reacting to cholestorol medication. Until I heard the diagnosis, I was unaware that my mother had been taking Simvastitin for 2 years. Fortunately she rapidly responded to IV treatment & 3 days later she was placed in a skilled nursing facility where she will be undergoing both physical and i.v. therapy to regain muscle use, rehydrate & flush her kidneys.",1,1,1

The dose was 40mg generic Zocor because there was no generic for Lipitor I was taking of 20mg. The first time I took this med I attributed the reaction to perhaps something I ate. I was able to try again 30 days later following the same pattern resulting in the same reaction, only much more severe, only minutes away from 911. I am frightened of what might have been. This is my first experience with a drug reaction!",1,1,1
Whenadvised to increase dosaqge from 15 to 20mg I later developed weakness in my legs. It was very evident.I stopped taking any for a month or so and the weakness went away.

Most days I feel like I have a mild case of the flu. Today I looked up the side effects of Simvastatin on this website. I immediately left a message for my doctor & will NOT take my daily dose of Simvastatin tonight!,5,2,5
"I'm thankful I found this chat site.  My Dr. first put me on 20mg generic. I experienced hand pain.  We tried 40mg and the pain got so bad I told him I couldn't take it any more.  I love to golf and I had no strength to hold the clubs. He changed my prescription to Lipator but the paharmacist called me before I picked up and told me how much more the drug was going to cost me, about $110 more for a 60 day supply.  I called the doctor and told him if have to do something else.  I'm back to the simvastatin 20mg dose.  Still have hand joint pain but not as severe as the 40 mg dose.  I can't wait for the generic on Lipator to come out.  I've heard that the side efects are less severe. I'm calling my dr. after the first of the year and seeing if there is anything else I can try.",5,2,4
I have been on this drug about 6 wks. but was on Zocor [had no problems with it until it went generic] I have some coughing and looose bowels every 2 days.Also bad sinususI am on 20mg. going off today telling doctor on Monday also elevated my liver read outs.,5,1,1
"I have been on this drug for two months (10mg) I am 48 and exercise regularly. About a month after starting the drug I developed bad joint pain, then back pain with tingling and numbness going to my feet. If I sit for any length of time I am so achy I can hardly move. Kinda flu like symptoms. I keep a headache.  After reading these reviews I am going to stop taking to see if this is my problem.",4,1,1

After taking this drug I thought my knees were going bad. I got so bad with knee and leg pain that I could not hardly walk. Was going to see a knee surgeon and then I started reading these reviews. Stopped the medication yesterday. I will report if this helps.,1,1,3
"No noticable side effects with 40mg dosage,  Doctor just upped to 80mg. We'll see.",5,4,3
"Was experiencing leg pains with the brand name Zocor, Dr. switched me to Lipitor then when generic Zocor came out I tried it, no leg pains.   HOWEVER, my cardiologist upped the dosage from 40mg to 80mg because he said the generic was only half strength.   True?   If true, what about FDA saying generic is sAME?",5,3,3
"I have experienced head pain in the top and back of my head.  I have chronic pain in back of skull which causes head pain to worsen.  Lots of stomach problems, cramps, gas, frequent runs to the bathroom.",2,1,1
"I took simvastatin for 4 months. It worked great for lowering my cholesterol, but the side effects were too much. I'm a tough guy like most of you so the headaches, leg cramps and fatigue didn't stop me. Then I started to have a problem with ED. The last 2 weeks I took the drug I had zero sexual desire! The doctor told me that I was getting older ""51"" and may need something to help. He was very sure that ED was not a side effect of simvastatin. Liar! After stopping the drug for a couple of weeks things returned to normal.",4,1,5
"I have been on a 20 mg dose for 6 days, because my doctor thought that Simvastatin would be more effective than Zetia.  Zetia caused no difficulties for me and had lowered my cholesterol, just not enough to satisfy the physician.  I have already experienced edema in my lower legs, increased fatigue, significant hair loss (which is rarely mentioned as a side effect), increased appetite, and numbness in my hands.  I found this site when researching the side effects of this drug, and I am glad that I did.  My decision to contact the doctor regarding discontinuing Simvastatin had already been made, but after reading all of these reviews, it justifies it even more.  I am a nurse and realized that the probable cause of my symptoms had to be the medication, as that was something new that I had only recently started.  But, my heart goes out to those of you who have suffered with the side effects for so long, only to find out that it was the medication that had caused the problem.  It is important to remember, that when a drug has a list of significant side effects that is as long as this one, you need to monitor any changes very carefully and follow up before more serious complications develop.

"I have type 2 diabetes my Dr. noted my LDL was up 2 points my triglycerides were up few points He said great preventive for Heart Attack and Stroke, on it 90 days No side affects",5,5,5
"I went to the Dr. beecause my hands were going to sleep and/or tingling many times a day.  She thought it was carpal tunnel.  I did have a little improvement treating it as such.  Last week I went because my legs were so weak and painful I could hardly navigate.  She took me off Simvastatin.  My legs are better -- however I wonder if they will ever really be OK again -- and wonder of wonders, my hands are remarkably better.  It didn't dawn on me that both issues were from the same problem.  Also severe diarrhea, and gastric/ulcer type pain, that is gone in less than a week. Simvastatin did an amazing job of lowering my  high cholesterol and dangerously high tryglicerides, but I'll take my chances without it. This has been a totally miserable experience. Bravo to those who can use it without side effects. Good on ya'!!",1,1,4
I took this drug for over three months and in the last three weeks I noticed my legs were aching so bad it felt like a was dragging 50 pounds balls around my ankles. The nights were so bad I could sleep my legs were cramping so bad. Went off the meds and three days later all of the symptoms went away. Now the doc has me on parvastatin and we shall see since the reviews are even worse for this one.,2,1,3

"Wow! I am SO thankful I found this review section! I thought I was going crazy! I had been on this drug for about a year, and never really connected the dots.Knee pain, tingling in lower legs and feet -- then hands, later. Lower back pain, then pain in the kidney area that eventually started waking me up at night, to now, SEVERE kidney and back pain that also includes my neck and between the shoulders. My heart palpitates and races now, especially at night. I went to the Dr. yesterday, and she said none of these symptoms are associated with this drug and almost laughed when I told her what I had read on WebMD. I stopped taking the drug yesterday after 4 days of pain so bad I could barely BREATHE!Thanks for sharing your experiences, and maybe everyone who has written here should report their symptoms to the drug company so there would be a record to track.

"This drug was prescribed for me mid September. I took it for 4 weeks. During this time I started to feel like I had a sore throat coming on. Then I had trouble swallowing. Next, I started getting an acid taste in my mouth. I then developed headaches from hell and finally stopped taking this crap 2 weeks ago. Last week, my doctor told me I had serious LPR, acute acid reflux. Since I quit taking this medication the headaches have gone and reflux (which I had never had before taking this) is beginning to get better.  I would not take this med again. ",5,1,1

This morning i've got bad stomach cramps and heartburn.I also have GERD (reflux disease).I don't know if I'm going to be able to tell the difference between RA joint pain and additional joint pain from this med.

"I recently saw a piece on TV indicating that Simvastatin (which is apparently manufactured in India) is soon to be taken off the market. The reasoning behind this was not given but I suspect the manufacturers of Zocor (the non-generic form) managed to win a court case against Simvastatin because it was cutting into their profits. This has been happening with many, very extensive medications recently. It is very unfortunate because Simvastatin has worked so well for me that my cholesterol levels since I've been taking it have been at or near the bottom of the acceptable range.",5,5,5

I went to the dr.recently and asked to see my bloodwork results and was concerned when I saw my AST and ALT was extremely elevated. When ""I"" pointed this out to the Dr. he told me to stop taking the medication immediately.  Apparently this drug is very damaging to the liver. Please make sure you always ask for your bloodwork results and discuss with your doctor.",4,1,4

"This drug caused deep muscle and bone aches. I did not recognize the cause, so suffered for many months. When I stopped, I felt much better after just 48 hours.  I did a good job at lowering cholesterol, but I have to try something else. The dr. has now put me on a lower dose of pravastatin, so I will see what happens with that.  Another good side effect of simvastatin was that my fingernails got much stronger and hair was thicker. Too bad it caused such pain.",1,1,5

"I was prescribed Simvastatin 20mg following a heart attack and was on it for one year, it worked in lowering my cholesterol & tri levels but my hair started to fall out in handfuls, bald patches started to appear. Not a good look for a woman! Other women told me their hair had fallen out when they were on statins. My doctor said it couldn't be the statin as there's no record of statins causing hair loss (is that because no doctors report it?). My cardiologist changed me to a differant statin (crestor) but the hair loss became more worse & worse. After two & a half years I have stopped taking statins, I stopped two weeks ago & my hair stopped falling out after a couple of days. I am now trying a 'natural' cholesterol reducer & hope it works for me (blood test in two months). I also hope that my hair grows back!!!",5,1,5

I've been taking Simvastatin for about four months now - I have had no problems with it. I was put on it as a preventative medicine because I am a diabetic and diabetics tend to run with high cholesterol numbers. And it was also hoped to help regulate my irregular heartbeat. At the time I was prescribed simvastatin my cholesterol levels were good and they are even better now to where my doctor says I can take it every other day instead of every day. My heartbeat is still irregular so it has been ineffective on that - but so far no major problems except I really miss grapefruit.  ,5,4,4
Just started taking this medicine on Sunday.Yesterday I felt tired and sick to my stomach. Tonight my chest don;t fell right and my arm is tired feeling. Hard time breathing.

I was on simvistatin for about 6 months... I started having stomach problems i.e. had to be near a bathroom ASAP -- then cramping would disappear for a couple weeks...I figured i could live with that affect because it was lowering the LDL considerably ...then a friend described gall bladder disease and i wondered if these pills could have affected the way the gall bladder works (??) -- went to my internist but she said no..has anyone else experienced this problem... I have D/C'd the drug for 6 weeks and the stomach problems have subsided some but not totally.. ,5,2,5

I did and within a few days, all side effects were almost entirely gone, thank goodness. Why oh why do we have to suffer with these terrible side effects??  Doctors should be more aware of what they are prescribing. I actually had one doctor tell me that ...""physicians are way too busy to be reading about side effects of medication...we don't know about these things until a patient has a side effect."" Well, HELLO!!! Some of those side effects are deadly!!! So what they are saying is... if people die, they die...now we know a little more about what the problems are with a particular medication.  People need to educate themselves...Look on the internet...Look on WebMD...Look up everything before you put it in your mouth and digest into your body!! At least my cardiologist had the good sense to stop my Simvastatin immediately and didn't tell me I was imagining things as my PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN seemed to think!

I called doc again, the nurs told me to go to ER. Went there and the doc told me to stop taking it. I told him I only took it once. He said there was no way this reaction was from this drug because ""no one has problems with this drug"". Take again when symptoms go away. NO WAY will I take this again!

I don't get blood tested until August.  I was on Crestor with no problems at all.  My ins. company recommended this drug because of the cost.  I do like that it is cheaper since I will be retiring soon, but I don't want to keep feeling like this either.  Whatever is wrong with our ins. companies and the drug companies?  If Crestor works for me (and I have been on 3 different kinds)then why don't they let me have it for the same price?  Any why don't they want to listen to my cardiologist?

"I was on Simvastatin 10mg the past month. Within 3 days of taking it I developed severe rashy red blothy hive-like skin outbreaks covering front neck below chin, upper chest, forearms, top of hands and severe dry skin overall. I never had skin problems, even acne as a kid. Knew it was the Rx. Clinic refused to believe it's the Rx and told me to see a dermatologist for a possible biopsy re: raised welts under my chin (????) and drop using it for a cople weeks. Have been off it a week. Skin cleared up 100% -- it's the drug. Also, I too had severe foot cramps at night and lower legs hurt so bad with edema/feet feeling like they'd burst from pressure again due to this drug -- as I realized 2 days ago that I'm actually living without any bodily pain whatsoever today. I told the MD re: dropping Simvastatin - I didn't want to go back on ANY statin drug. She insisted I stay on track with them and try another one: CRESTOR which I picked up but refuse to take now - that Rx appears more lethal/fraught with issues than any and is extremely EXPENSIVE. Am insisting on natural means or non-statin rx. Geesh!",1,1,1

"I began taking Simvastatin over a year ago.  Dropped my 230 cholesterol to 180 in four months, but I began having problems I never had before. A severe yeast infection, other skin problems and psoriasis in my scalp.  My hair began gradually falling out over a year. I kept asking my dermatologist if Simvastatin could be the problem.  He incorrectly told my no.  I have lost so much hair over time, I have bald spots.  I revisited the side affects of this drug, and yes, there it was, hair loss.  It took me over a year to discover this.  I am reporting this so that overs will learn from my bad experience with Simvastatin.  ",4,1,3
"51 year old female. THANKS to all for your reviews.  I just associated this drug with my extreme fatigue.  I was taking 40 mg and Dr. upped it to 80 mg.

"I took this drug for 2 days and it made me so terribly sick to my stomach that I feel like I want to vomit and it is still feeling nauseating. I also experienced head ache and increased muscle cramps. I am not going to take it anymore and I am going to call dr. to see if I can take something natural or go back on Lipitor. I had to go off lipitor because my insurance changed, but I am going to see if I can get it again. I just may have to pay the price, since I had very good luck with Lipitor and no side effects whatsoever. It really lowered my cholesterol and triglycerides. I would not recommend this drug. Too many scary side effects. beware!!",1,1,1
"I started taking simvastatin 13 days ago. Two days ago I began to have blurred vision, left arm bruises, leg and muscle cramps and extreme nausea. I was taking 20mg. Cholesterol level was 279.

On January 10th, 2008 my numbers dropped from near 300 to 160.  I test again in June.  Taking them at night is easier.  Puting them in a pill organizor is easier.  I am also looking at taking other vitamins and suplements at the same time.  I am looking for some information that would identify any couteracting benefits of taking vitamins/suplements with Simvastatin.",5,5,5
"I am a 61 year old male. I started taking Simvastatin a week ago, per my Doctors orders. I have stopped taking it because of a side effect, extreme fatigue.

Not much to write as I have just started one (1) 40 mg tablet at bedtime. I'm hopefull that treatment program will provide benefit without side effects.  I'm 56 years old with a very active lifestyle involving cycling 5-6 days for and average of 2.5 to 4.5 houra a day.  My primary care physician started me on simvastatin due to my LDL's tracking higher the last 3 years.  from 128 to 134 to 145.  HDL's ranged 64 to 70 back down to 58 the last fasting blood check.  I can't yet rank the effectiveness of the drug because I just started taking it. Will find out in June.    ,5,4,3

When I stopped taken meds and called dr - he put me on another statin. After reading reviews on that one - decided to diet and exercise my way back. Also had hair loss, went to dermatologist who made the connection. Am being treated for that - another pill!!  But no side effects and hair is coming back. Hate getting older!!  ",4,1,1
"I have been taking this med for almost a year and until I read these reviews did not know it could cause so many problems.I have a lot of side effects mentioned i.e. severe constipation,bloating,gastritus,constant minor aches and pains in muscles,not able to sleep comfortably and other problems.My Dr.reduced my script from 40 mg to 20 and I still have the same problems.I'am going to ask her to take me off it at my next appointment even though it has reduced my cholesterol problems.",5,2,4

"I am 21 days into a 30 day script.  After reading many of the reviews posted here I am beginning to become concerned with my own possible side effects.  I have been complaining to my boyfriend about marks on my body which appeared to be ""body acne"".  They look similar to a spider bite and itched the same as well.  The marks on the inside of my thigh (where they rub when I walk) have large red rings of irritation about an inch in diameter.  I have also noticed a lack of energy and feel constantly tired.  Lastly, I feel as if I have been fighting a UTI for the past week; scared to drink cranberry juice.  My follow up testing is not until April, I hope I can hold out long enough to see the effects it has on my rather high cholesterol.  I know my comments are similar to those before me however no one has mentioned the red marks on the body.  ",5,2,1
"My doctor put me on 80mg.  Such extreme leg pain, cramping.  No sleeping at night.  Tested me for other problems, but when it came down to it, I stopped taking the med and started to improve.  Now will I ever get full mobility & strength of my leg muscles back???  Very angry with the docs",2,1,2

I have, however, experienced weakness and pain in my right hand from my sholder to my elbow.  I have also experienced muscle sorness in my back and also had direa.  I had no such experience with Crestor.  However, the insurance company does not want to pay for Crestor because it is more expensive than Simvas. My dr says she can make a case now that I have tried the cheaper drug and had adverse reactions to successfully swich me to Crestor.  Hope this helps. ",5,1,5

I was suffering from severe muscle cramps and knots in my calf area and soreness of knee joints that started working toward my hips. I went off this med and symptoms have subsided. Talked with my coworkers and they said that I was taking it wrong and to try taking it at bedtime with crackers or a piece of fruit or cheese.  Well - so far I'm on day 4 and the side effects have not come back. Why doesn't the Pharmacy's put ""TAKE AT BEDTIME with FOOD"" ON THE LABEL! Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!",5,1,3

I've been on Simvastatin for about 9 months and I noticed that my arthritis and muscle pain is progressively getting worse.  I take Trazadone at night to help me sleep.  I also get muscle cramping, especially in my calves.  After reading many of the other reviews on this site, I'm now wondering if the Simvastatin is playing a part in the exacerbation of my overall pain.  However, I've had excellent results on blood tests for cholesterol and it (along with other high blood pressure meds) has lowered my blood pressure immensely.  Plan to talk to my dr. at my next appt. next week. ",5,2,4

Rated first and third sections a one, not sure if it works or if I should be happy yet :)  I am currently taking medication for hypothroidism, high blood pressure, Gout and acid reflux along with this one.  Im sure the hypothroidism also contributes to the high triglyceride levels, my hdl is low, around 20, but total is 154.  Have lost 15 pouds in the last 2 months, changing my eating habits, no soda, have an alcoholic drink once a year maybe (wont do it on these meds), and have never smoked, I wonder if losing weight puts more fat into the bloodstream.

It is still only 25 and for women should be 40 or above.  Also I was hoping that it would significanly lower my C-Reactive Protein Level which has raised 3 points higher since beginning simvastatin.  I'm hoping with the higher dosage that I was put on 30 mg. per day instead of 10mg. my C.R.P. level will drop and my good cholesterol will raise.

"Love the Symlin medication. HATE THE PEN DELIVERY SYSTEM WE ARE FORCED TO UTILIZE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO USE SYMLIN. Bring back the Symlin vial.... PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE REVIEW. I am one of the original members of the DCCT(Diabetes Control and Complications Trial), as well as one of the original members of the on-going EDIC Study. I am one of the original test participants / patients to utilize Symlin as part of my diabetes management. Symlin was originally given by injection from a vial and my results were fantastic, great, dependable and predicable. I originally lost 45 pounds and enjoyed a fantastic increase in my blood sugar control as a result of using Symlin injected from a vial. I was very pleased. However, then came the Corporate decision to cease producing Symlin in vial form and go to a inject-able pen delivery system and change/modify the Symlin strength/dosage concentration. In my opinion, as well as other patients and doctors, it is the biggest mistake that could have been made. A decision that as far as we can tell was made with little or no input from doctors or patients involved in the daily use of Symlin as part of Diabetes management.

"I just ended a 1 week trial of Symlin.  I'm also taking Humalog and Lantus.  I was on Victoza before Symlin.   For the week I've been taking it, I've had a vice like headache and extreme fatigue.  My blood sugars at first were great but as the week went on, they increased and this morning I had a fasting sugar of 296.  This drug didn't work for me.",5,1,1
"I have taken 30 units for 4 months. I have lost 15 lbs and decreased insulin by 1/3. Before symlin, after meal BS would be 200-300. Now after meals, BS range is 130-170. Because of fatigue, I do not take if I am driving after a meal. Sometimes I feel nauseated, but the benefits are worth the occasional side effects.",4,4,5
"Symlin is OK. It has reduced the glucose fluctuations moderately in both pre and post prandial states. My question is this .. when you have a very low uptake of glucometer at around 3% in low income countries and at the max 50% noted in urban areas and then 'stick up' rate around half of those at the end of 1 year, how can we use symlin in these patients and how effective in these low monitoring patients. ",3,2,3
"I am 37 years old, have been type 1 for 13 years.  Have always ate well and exercised.  Symlin has helped with my post meal BS and I have also lost the last 10 lbs I wanted to lose.  Although, I am wondering if it has made me lose muscle??  I am afraid I will keep losing weight and do not want to lose more.  My bra size has gone down too far!!  Anyone else??",3,4,4
I am on my 5th pen and am starting to see weight loss.  I find that I have a little nausea if my meal is not balanced but overall the medication seems to be doing what it is supposed to.  I am not on insulin and have not experienced any lows.  ,5,4,4
"I started this med to help conquer my insulin resistance which I developed after 44 years. I am taking it in conjunction with a dietary and excercise program. However, the side effects-nausea,extreme fatigue and increased irritability are really bothering me. Has anyone else experienced the faigue and mood changes?",5,1,5
"I know if I follow a good exercise program and eat accordingly...Symlin works better than sliced bread. However, I am noticing growth of hair and fingernails and toenails. Symlin is the last medication that has been added. Has anyone experienced growth in hair and nails?",3,5,5
"Symlin has helped me lower my blood sugar, but I have had strange side effects that are very disruptive.  I get very nauseated and feel like I'm going to vomit, but I also get chills and it makes me nervous/shaky inside and I end up gritting my teeth.  This lasts for approx 3 hours.  I have lost weight, but the above symptoms have been quite disruptive to my productivity in general.",4,3,4
This drug immediately brought my blood sugars down.  But the cost!  My co-pay for 1 month is $150.00.  I do not know if I can afford to stay on this wonderful drug.  Is the vials cheaper?,5,4,5
I used this medication for 1 month and it does give a full feeling but a couple of hours later i seemed crae sweets and  Dr's couldn't tell if its related but 1 month after taking this drug 120 units each dose I had a seizure with bg of only 60. Now I'm taking 30 each meal and its working well.,5,2,3
"I am what is now being referred to as a Type 1.5 diabetic-insulin dependent adult onset. I am also ""brittle"". I am on 120 Symlin at this time plus Humalog and Lantis. This protocol has been the most effective in years. I also do not have extreme hunger pangs. I have not been able to reduce the Humalog significantly, but the blood sugars are in far better control. I had 2 extreme lows, but those were due to extraordinary circumstances.",4,5,4
"I have a problem feeling full.  This med, with some headaches, does help.",4,3,4
"After unsuccesful try of Byetta and Januvia, I found this not to work either pp bs are over 360. Plus it makes my gastroparesia so much worse, either cant go or go all day. Between the nuisance of extra shots, which you can never tell if the pendose went in, extra toilet issues and and no results, I cant reccomend this drug, plus on top of it all.",2,1,1
"Post meal numbers are much better with Symlin.   I can 1/2 the humalog dose and so far, I have not had any lows at all.   I take 10 U at Br. 10 U at lunch and 20 U at dinner.   Pre dinner numbers were higher than should be, next AM numbers  (fasting) higher than should be, since taking the 20 U of Symlin before dinner,  I have normal numbers after dinner and in the AM.   I am very happy with Symlin.  I recommend this med to anyone who is taking insulin and not having the success they want, to try Symlin.   It has helped me alot.",5,5,5
"I have not lost as much weight as expected and over time, drug effects wear off. Nausea initially was terrible, but stopped after 3 weeks or so. Low BS are terrible, but my A1C is down 2.6 points to a 6.6.",3,4,3
The side effects are harsh,3,4,4
It has not worked for me. It has increased my appetite. Blood sugars have actually gone up,4,1,2
"Yes, it is three more shots and is clearly seen as a chore I must do.  But what a wonder this drug has been.  My blood sugars have come into easy control almost immediately.  After a period of use (2-3 weeks) I found myself eating far less.  After 2 months, I wanted less.  I have lsot 20 pounds in two months with only modest increase in exercise.  Do take those warnings about over-eating seriously when you start.  Be prepared for some lows initially, too.  ",3,5,5
"did wonders for my blood sugars and I lost 20 lbs over 6 months.Side effects were not able to sleep, anxious, developed severe depression including suicide ideation. all of the above symptoms disappeared when the drup was stopped",5,1,5
 This medication has saved my life and has gotten my blood sugar under control.,5,5,5
After reaching my prescribed dosage I found the amount of food I injested decreased considerably and I felt full for a longer amount of time,4,4,4
"When starting the injections, My glucose levels improved immeadiatwly, SO I KNEW this drug along with novolog insulin was currently the best way for me to control my type 1 diabetes. I love it! I've lived with diabetes all my life, since the age of two, and it is more eaiser now tnan ever to control the disease. If anyone is looking for advice on weather or not to start using symlin, I would highly recommend giving it a try. I admit it was a little tough getting used to the side effects in the beginning,though in the end its worth it.         ",4,4,5
"It took quite a while to get used to, but once I got the hang of it, it was very helpful. Most of the side effects subsited (nausea, etc.). My only issue with it now is that it stings when I inject it. However, it is a small price to pay for the improvement in glucose.",3,5,4
"I just started to use a week ago and some of the time it makes me feel full, depends on the food and when i take it.",1,2,3
New doctor switched me from Farxiga to Synjardy. A1C went from 6.5 to 8.7. Not effective at all. ,5,1,1
I have been on Synjardy for a year and have had no side effects and my A1C has averaged 6.0 and started at 10.6,5,5,5
Dr. Prescribed. Got worried rt away. Blood sugar went way up. Even tried  higher dose. Not very effective. ,1,1,1
this medication gave me a yeast infection within days of starting.,4,1,1
After 2 doses had to stop- anaphylacic reaction.  Dr. called company and they thought it strange as others hadn't  had reactions like this.  No follow up at all from anyone.,4,1,1
I have been on this med for almost 1 year 30mg it brought my A1C from 10 to 8.7.  But I also started exercise spin I won't give all the credit to Tanzeum.  I have several side effect that won't go away.  Main One the pain on my left side.  My doctor increased me two months ago to 50mg.  I have severe ear congestion.   I have an appt tommorow I won't off the med.  Side affects should go away if not they are doing damage.,2,1,2
It took about one month before I noticed an appreciable difference in sugar levels but now (6th month) my readings usually only exceed 100 right after I eat and within 3-4 hours return to sub 100.  Just hope I don't get thyroid cancer.,3,5,5
I was taking Trulicity and was very happy with it. I had to switch to tanzeum because of my insurance company. The tanzeum works fine also but it is a hazzle to take. The mixing is a pain and I usually do it the night before. The trulicity had a button and it injected the needle into your skin itself. You have to stab yourself and no way am i doing that so once primed I pull off the needle and use one of my insulin needles for which I have a device that I just need to push a button for the needle to inject. Again the whole thing is a big inconvenience. i guess only rich people get to have medication that is easy to take. ,4,2,4
"Taking for three weeks have had horrible side effects.vomiting,headache,exhaustion,sweats,but have lost weight and much lower sugars.I am trying to make it through the negative effects due to positive results.also starts to give me panic attacks.hoping side effects go away",4,2,4
Does anyone know if nauseau gets better after using for a while?  I have been using for about two months and still very sick the first few days after the injection.  Can't tell it's helping my sugars either.,1,1,2
"My main complaint is the pain injection. Pen to large clumsy to use with onehand.  Also, out of the last 23 pens, 10 of them have had floating particles or just particles stuck to the inside of the tube, making them useless.  Called manufacturer and they have a 3 in your lifetime replacement policy.  The pharmacy would not replace them either.  So, I have quit using this medication since the manufacturer will not stand behind their product.  ",4,3,4
"while I lost 13lbs in UNDER 7 DAYS, this medication put me in the Cardiac Care Unit at my local hospital for 4 days! SEVRELY DEHYDRATED, my Ekgs were all abnormal. It took away all of my appetite and I was nauseous 24/7. The smell and even the thought of food made me literally sick, I couldnt even cook for my husband.  I had no energy and was unable to get out of bed the entire week. Severe diarrhea the day after the first injection and the day that I passed out and fell in my bathtub and ended up in the hospital. Im not going to lie, I LOVED the not wanting to eat and the weightloss..I DO NOT love what it did to me. My blood pressure bottomed out and was roller coastering for days. NEVER AGAIN! STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG!!! I dont know how it got approved by the FDA!!!!",1,1,5
I took Tanzeum 7 weeks. Around 4 weeks I was in constant pain ( back and groin area)and  developed a shadow over my eyes. Medication did cut appetie.  I wouldnt  reccommend this med to anybody.  I think its in the experimental stage. I stopped taking Tanzeum.  I originally asked my Doctor for Byetta she pushed the Tanzeum,2,1,2
"I have been taking Tanzeum for 1 1/2 years now and I have had no side effects what so ever.   Didn't lose any weight, but haven't felt sick or tired or had any of the side affects others have mentioned.   The reason I was put on because my numbers went from 6.2 to 7.2 but since I have been on it back to down to the low 6's.   Overall satisfied",5,4,4
"It was literally forced on me at the doctors office. He does lots of studies for the university and I feel like a lab rat. It was given to me about 24 hours ago and I don't feel well at all. Prior to getting it, I was feeling ok. Now I am having migraines, bladder pain, burning, frequency, nausea, back pain, muscular pain, and weakness.Overall fatigue. Who knows what is to come.",2,1,2
"Nausea, rash in the body  and weakness - 3   reasons why this  drug is  very dangerous. It also aggravates  thyroid making it worse. After start taking this drug I developed nodules in thyroid and lost my good health and grew sick like hell. One thing it did that it get my A1C under control but I am convinced this is a poison. Not sure why this is being is FDA approved? Stop using after one month completely. ",3,1,3
"Hi this drug caused me migraines immediately.  I really don't see any positive changes in BS as a result of this medicine.  Yes, appetite is supressed but the migraines are not worth me taking this medication.  Also caused some dryness in my eyes. ",3,3,3
"After starting using Tanzeum, I started having skin rashes on my chest during the first week. By the 2nd week I started having heart pain and feeling weak and dizziness. After taking my 3rd injection at the start of 3rd week, I felt as if I was slowly dying and felt like if I was either going to faint or get a heart attack. I called my doctor to let him know I was stopping the use of this medication. This drug is a poison and shouldn't be prescribed to anyone, unless you want to kill them.",2,1,2
"Have always had aches and pains with Diabetes, but seems like it is more frequent on this drug.  Back and side pain, severe dry skin, tired, and very light headed.  My sugars have been great...not sure if I will continue or not.",5,2,5
"I've been on it for 5 weeks. The first three shots we're painless....couldn't even feel them. The fourth one kind of hurt. By the fifth one, the shot, and medicine and injection site hurt VERY BADLY for over an hour! Ever since the fifth shot I've been extremely fetigue. Every since taking it, I've become NAUSHIOUS on a DAILY basis. I didn't put two and two together until I was reading side effects and reviews. Although, it curves my appetite a lot. Even though it runs me down, with all the side effects I'm determined to stick with it to see how much it helps with my weight loss. ",3,5,5
I took my first shot Sunday by tues night was sick sick sick. Major nausea taking zofran every 4 hours. Some diarrhea but mostly stomach cramps and my sides and back hurt. I feel like I did 3 weeks ago during a kidney infection. I'm not taking one more shot of this poison. After this and farxiga I am convinced my doctor is trying to kill me lol.,1,1,1
Why would the FDA approve this? I took one dose & had vomiting & liquid stools for 2 days straight. Went to ER for dehydration & anti-nausea treatment. Diarrhea has persisted a week now & is not subsiding despite Imodium.,1,1,1
Been getting sicker by the day on 50mg.  Severe back and side pain.  Feel like I have an upper respiratory infection.  Trouble breathing.  Legs started itching. Bad drug...stopping ASAP,4,1,1
"I just started this week. My blood sugars have improved, but I have developed a pain on the right side of my neck. I don't think I will take the injections again. I will talk to my endo. doctor and try to use diet and exercise alone to improve my blood sugar numbers.",3,3,3
"I have been taken for less than 6 months  and I feel terribly ill with injection site pain and rash.  I feel like what my father expressed when he was dying of cancer!  There has to be something better.  I feel like vomiting all the time.  My neck is sore on one side all the time now.  Seeing the doctors tomorrow, this ends. Done being a lab rat.  There is just to many diabetics and I feel that they are using us for this reason,they won't have to pay for people to sign up for this posion. ",1,1,1
"3rd week made me so sick felt like I wanted to die, but thought maybe something else so tried it again on Sunday , my shot day and again felt sick for 3 days, feltsuper bad again no more for me",2,1,2
I took Tanzeum for four months after the third month I started having a really bad reaction to it. My injection site would get so red welped up and itch. My doctor said that I should get off of it immediately. I wouldn't suggest tanzeum. ,3,1,1
I have been taking this medication since September of this year and now have a mass on my pancreas ,2,1,2
"I feel great. It suppresses appetite. Before when I ate meals I never experience the ""full"" feeling. Now when I eat I feel full after taking a few bite. No more over eating for me. I have experienced weight loss and an increase in energy. My glucose levels are never over 124. Very happy overall. My only concern is the cancer warning. ",4,4,5
"I have been on this for 7 months now for PCOS I had high hopes it would help me loose some weight and help me from becoming diabetic.  The good, my numbers are all In range, I have have had 3 periods in the last 6months and the hair on my face grows a lot slower.  The bad, I'm fatigued most of the time, stomach issues nausea, indigestion, weakness (unable to lift usual amount of weights while working out) and in the last 3weeks I believe I have lost half my hair, no kidding I have had friends ask me if I was alright due to the drastic reduction of my hair and weakness. Last week was the last time I will take this and I hope to regain my straight and hair.   ",5,2,3
"My overall experience has been favorable.  I do seem to have backaches, however, didn't begin to experience until approximately week 9 (I am on week 12) I do plan on discussing this with my endocrinologist.  If it persists, I will discontinue and try something else.  Any recommendations if Tanzeum does not work out? ",4,3,4
"I think this shot is the cause of part of my husband heart problems. I on the other had had bloating, in my back and burps and gas of rotten eggs. I went to the hospital with the pain twice. It was over powering. My husband also had rotten egg burps and gas. We had dark urine and diarrhea. Will not be taking this any more. ",5,1,1
"My blood sugar numbers have been MUCH better. BUT, I give myself the shot on Sunday eve, then on Monday I am bloated like a balloon.  My symptoms got better as the week went along, but each week was worse than the week previous.  I also had loss of energy and belching that was like rotten eggs.  I have been taking this for 4 weeks and am stopping now.  ",5,3,5
I took for 5 weeks went into kidney failure with a kidney function number of 14.3 when 1-2 is normal. Blood sugar went down to 44. kidney function is improving. Not taking anymore per Dr. ,3,1,1
"In just two months, I went from A1C of 10.0 to 7.9. I was also taking actos but stopped that due to the swelling so now my other drugs are metformin and glimipiride. My glucose readings so far have all been normal; 120's a few hours after meals and 80's to 90's after workouts.So nice not to see readings in the mid 200's. I have noticed that my strength training has been resulting in a younger looking physique similar to when I was 28. I haven't really noticed anything negative except I have no desire to take a scoop of chocolates from the candy bowl at work due to the strong appetite suppressant. Works much better than bydureon for me and it doesn't really hurt when I get it at the right angle. It also seemed to work within a few days of my first dose whereas many other drugs take about 4 weeks for it to kick in.",4,5,5
Been taking this drug for approximately 4 weeks. But have noticed that I have zero energy.,5,4,4
"Although I did experience a loss of appetite, I did not lose any weight. I took Tanzeum for 6 weeks and on or about week 3, I began to experience itching around my ankles and legs. The type of itching associated with an allergic reaction but with no rash or redness or other markings. I decided on my own to stop at week 6 because I was so uncomfortable with the itching and thanks to a commercial I saw on TV that mentioned the side effect of ""itching"" with this drug. That was it for me. I was able to make the connection between the drug and my symptoms. My doctor's office said I was the first to complain of this (hard to believe).  I just don't know how long before my body is rid of this horrible drug.  Going to take a Benadryl now......",3,1,2
"I was sneezing some with 30 mg upped to 50 mg and now nose, eyes and throat burning and sinitus.  Anyone else have this problem.",5,2,4
"I have lost a little weight,  But after 5 months of use I am experiencing burning mouth, and sinitus.  Not sure if its the medicine but I suspect it is.  I may go off for a few weeks and see. ",4,3,4
I have been taking Tanzeum for four weeks and now into my fifth week.  Along with my diabetic friendly meals I am now losing some weight which wasn't happening with Metformin alone.  I have not had any of the side effects that are listed by the maker but did have constipation to some degree one week.  We will see if that continues or not.  It's easy to use!,5,5,5
Been very I'll taking this drug.,4,1,2
The drug has been very effective for me. The only side effect I have had is sleep deprivation or insomnia. I took my first doses and I couldn't sleep for 6 hours. But I am happy with my blood sugar numbers. I will see what the doctor recommend for the sleep deprivation. Much easier to use than Bydureon.,5,5,5
Works great no side effects,5,5,5
seemed to help during first 3 months and not lowering my glucose now.having lot of congestion.i wouldn't start it again.,1,1,1
As my doctor has been increasing my dosage my diabetes has gone up.  I was doing well at 7.0 but doctor changed me from Actors to few alternative drugs in the name of improving. Now I am on Trajenta and he recently increased the dosage and it has now shot up to staying above 12.5 on an average.  I don't this this is helping me at all.  ,1,1,1
After a two week trial my blood sugar readings were very good so it was used instead of taking insulin before each meal.  Once a day Trajenta and one shot of long lasting insulin and things are fine.,5,5,5
"My numbers have only gone higher! I have been on Tradgenta for 6 weeks, now. ",5,1,1
I've been taking this medicine for 3 months.  My glucose test results have over 200 the entire time.  Even fasting in the AM.  My Doctor continues to insist I take it and I cant understand why.  I am changing Doctors,1,1,1
"I took this medicine for a month and a half. My heart started racing, shortness of breath lightheadedness and tightness in my throat I also was sweating like crazy. ",1,1,1
I've notied that my glucose have been higher since taking this.  I've also been starting to have abdominal pains. Not effective at all in my opinion.,5,1,1
"I was pleased when my pcp recently added this to my metformin and lantus (insulin). I'm almost surprised that I'm getting it as it's very expensive. However my glucose numbers have been way above normal lately. I guess that I wanted to believe that I could get away with being less strict with my diet. From what I can see this drug is not what I would call highly effective. You would be better off spending the money on a gym membership than this expensive ineffective medication, in my opinion. ",3,1,3
I have been taking this for a month. My levels have been in the lower 200's in the am and 197's in the afternoon after I eat. 150'S after I walk 2.5 miles a day. I am very active. I've lost 13lbs with diet and exercise. My levels do not seem to be going down. I have had some abdominal issues too. Concerned I am seeing my doctor this Friday for a follow up. Anyone else having the same problem? ,5,2,2
I took this drug for a week and a half before fulling my prescription due to the 'few' potential side effects. I rarely have any but was sure that this was enough time for me to have started showing symptoms. I was very wrong. I had not met my deductible so I paid nearly $400 for the prescription. By the next day I had abdominal pain and within three days pancreatitis. I never even opened that bottle of pills. My doctor is another issue but I will NEVER take this medicine again.,1,1,1
It never worked.  I am now sitting on a 9.8 A1C reading after a couple of years of use.  This is expensive medicine in which I have spent a fortune on with no results.  ,5,1,1
Had to stop taking metformin due to explosive stomach issues.  Doc put me on this med instead. After 1 1/2 months there are no side effects and my blood sugar has risen considerably.  Expensive medication that does nothing for me .   ,4,1,1
"My sugar levels in am 89-125. Been having lots of phlegm never thought it was because of tradjenta, until I was going thru the revues. Very expensive though.   ",4,3,4
"Have been taking for almost 3 weeks.  Experiencing GERD, Diarrhea, and nausea.  Almost too sick to function.  Have lost appetite.  It wasn't working yet anyway.",5,1,1
"I have had skin rash and face swelling plus neck swelling. Choke easily. Some of the places that covered my arms and face were like whelps then in a couple of days they oozed a clear liquid. Then they became sores. One of the sores has been on my arm for 5 months. I showed my diabetes doctor, reg doctor and went to dermatalogist.  Dr put me one prednisone three times.  it is like no one knew what causes this. I used cortisone creme and another one that is gem...something and none help. I have kept taking the trajenta with metformin like the Dr says. Numbers never went down and I gained weight. Face still swelled and still itch so bad I can't sleep.  I guess I should stop taking it awhile to see if that helps. Until I read on here I never dreamed it caused this. ",2,2,2
"it came on over 4 month or so i,m over weight by 50 pounds witch is still do able.i started testing and was seeing numbers in the hi 400,my doctor called me in and started me on metformin 1000 to 1500 a day.its been 2 weeks now and my numbers are almost normal 108/118 morning test.my other doctor put me on tradjenta daily 5mg,things are going well numbers are good range know spikes.i was reading noral numbers early in 2015,i was taking prodazone for a cold infection,and injections for a foot problem i guess 6 injections over 6 months. rare but can shoot your a1c up .so now i need to work with this to get to a good number every time i test.

"worked great getting blood sugar level down but developed terrible itching in my scalp as well as small bumps that when you pop them clear liquid oozes out, also found in the scalp.  The itching is the worst I have ever felt and today is day 5 I have been off this medication, as well as stopping Metformin until the itching ceases.  Doctor thinks it is not related to this medication, I believe it is as I have never had scalp itch this bad.",5,2,5
Rating in effectiveness is fake (must fill).Didn't give me a chance to make blood works to see if it was effective because on my 8th pill it developed a severe rash in my thighs. $17 a tablet super expensive though.,5,1,1
"I started taking this medication on July 1, 2014.  On July 4th a rash developed on my face and neck.

"I'VE BEEN ON TRADJENTA 5MG FOR SEVERAL MONTHS (6?) AND I CAN'T SEE ANY HELP USING THIS $854 DRUG (90 DAY SUPPLY). I'VE STOPPED TAKING IT TO SEE IF MY SUGAR LEVELS GO UP, DOWN OR STAY THE SAME.

"Very expensive co-pay, over $200.00",5,5,5

"I've been on Tradjenta two months and have seen a reduction in my blood sugars (15-20%).  I also take Metformin with this medication.  When I took it without food I developed a headache.  Every since taking it with food in my system, no problems.  ",5,5,4
I started taking this drug 6 months ago and it never controlled my sugar. My fasting was 157 on average with it. I started putting on weight shortly after starting it and it increased monthly. I just went to my Dr. and they found I have developed an irregular heart beat since starting the drug. I am now off the drug and back on Byetta which is the drug that worked the best for me from the start. I had wanted to get away from the injectable medication so I tried Tradjenta... BIG mistake! I hope my heart issues goes away soon.,5,1,1
Taking this medication has produced a reaction. Swollen tongue and hard to swallow. Feels like phlem in my throat and can't remove it. Throat sore also. Dr prescribed Prednisone for inflammation of the throat...not working.,3,1,1
Works for me. Sugar level has remained stable between 85 - 121,5,5,5
I just started taking Trajenta a month ago.  I have experienced fast heart rate and I have become very jittery.  It scares me sometimes.  I was on Metformin before but that did not agree with my stomach. I become very weak and nervous.  I am going to check with my doctor once again to see if there is another drug I can try.  I'm thinking since I was diagnosed with border line diabetes maybe these drugs are a little too strong for me.  I have had diabetes since 2010 and my reading is and has always been between 6.2 and 6.5. ,4,1,1
"My fasting blood sugar is between 110 and 129 since starting this drug.  Was always below 100 on Metformin.  Unfortunatley, my digestive system couldn't handle it.  That part is doing much better on Tradjenta, but now I'm experiencing swollen feet and ankles.  Am seeing the doctor to get his opinion, but I'm not happy the sugar isn't controlled better.  Probably need to find another.",5,2,2

"October 23, 2011 .After six days I got a reaction that was so bad I landed up in the hospital for five days. Total body rash, peeling and blisters, even in mouth. Doctors couldn't even believe it the reaction was so bad. I have never had a allergic reaction to anything before.",4,1,1
"was taken off of actos & put on tradjenta along with Amyrl and my levels are sky high 307. never been that high. no real side effects from the drug, it just does not work & is very expensive",4,1,1
This medication makes my feet burn and heals hurt. It's been difficult to walk.,5,1,2
"I used Tradjenta Oral ""without any improvement"" in my blood sugar readings whatsoever. My readings skyrocketed to the high 200's and 300's  There was ""NO"" improvement, even eating low carb foods at 60 or less grams per day.  ",4,1,1
When I first started this drug my glucose was in the high 300's the Dr.  prescribe 30 units. after 2 months my dosage had to be decreased to 25 units because my glucose reading were too low. now my glucose reading are in the 100's. when I first started this medicine I did have some side effects (dizziness upon standing was horrible and my nose felt tight)it was vey scary but I stuck with it now those side effects has subsided. I don't work anymore so it was easy for me to just stay at home and lay down in the bed. If I couldn't tolerate it I would have ask the dr. for something else I have been on this medication for four months. No one showed me how to use this medicine and some times it didn't go in and it rand ran down my stomach after re-reading the instructions I learned how to use the pen correctly Now I have to remember to eat a evening snack sometimes my glucose will drop low around 5 or 6 am and I have to get something right away. so I drink a cup of milk while I am fixing my breakfast. ,5,4,5
Start to take due to insurance problems and I love it the blood sugar is getting low and stable I would recommend to anyone,5,5,5
Caused extreme mood degradation for me which is indeed listed as a possible side effect.  mdg - Texas,5,1,1
"I've been Type 1 for 52 years and this is by far the best insulin I've ever used.  I've been on it for about three weeks with no lows - just excellent BG readings.  My insulin needs have also dropped by about a third.  And instead of split doses, my basal with Tresiba is now once a day in the AM. My doctor and I are both delighted with the results I have been having.  I'm using the U-100, and the newly designed pens are far above any others I've handled.  My biggest concern in the beginning was how would it be to work with a 42 hour insulin.  I would suggest reading Novo's full information on Tresiba before converting, because it does address this issue.  But switching over for me was actually very easy.  One important note in their info was that it takes 8 days for Tresiba to reach it's full potential, so  any increases have to be made slowly. I've only had to increase my initial dose by two units, one time, and at this point I believe I'm right on target.  My morning blood sugars are the kind I used to only dream about! :-) I hope more people are given the opportunity to try Tresiba.  As far as the rumors of sky high cost is concerned, the Humalog pens I buy are actually more expensive than the Tresiba!  So, don't believe every rumor you read.  Talk to Novo, and talk to folks that are using Tresiba if you want to know how what it's really all about.  My father had Type 1 diabetes most of his life, and his parents told him that in his life time there would probably a cure.  I've had Type 1 most of my life, and my parents told me that in my life time there would probably be a cure.  Well, I don't see 'the cure' happening any time soon, but until then for me Tresiba is about as close to 'a cure' as you can get. IMHO of course.",5,5,5
"I started the first week shot.  The pen was easy to inject.  The first day I had energy.  The third day I had immense nausea, headache,body pains, severe pain from below chest to abdomen.  I had chest pains with shortness of breath, and fatigue.  All of this started on day 3.  I will not be taking a 2nd week shot. Went back to Lantus insulin pens.",1,1,1
I have been taking Trulicity for nearly two months; I have had a few normal blood sugar readings but nothing miraculous -- but no terrible side effects either.  I will ask my doctor about increasing to dose to see if my numbers improve further.  ,3,2,3
"yes it has caused some diarrhea every time i take it an also it does kind of keeps my stomach feeling funny,i dont have as much of a appetite and have lost about 45 lbs after 4 months. my a1c was 7.5 before and at my last check it was 5.1 and  my blood checks were about 170 -200 before and now 125-145 i am totally happy with the results..",5,5,5

"Started off no side effects the first two weeks. Week 3 took the shot, 24 hours later every symptom hit except the constipation and low blood sugar, actually my sugar spiked to 247, the pain was so intense in my abdomen w vomiting diarrhea, and chest pain that radiated down my left arm. Age wise to young for heart attack, Dr assessed me , it caused a prolonged PR interval in my EKG. Now one week post reaction ,still taking zofran for side effects.good news no cardiac damage or kidney damage.",4,1,1
"I've completed 3 months use. My morning sugar is half of what it once was. I had side effects for the first month, stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, headache. I still have more flatulence than usual, but nothing else. I haven't lost weight, sadly. But I am very pleased with my blood count. If you are new to Trulicity, don't let the negative comments stop you from continuing unless you are utterly miserable for more than a month. People are more likely to write a review of something they dislike than they are if they are pleased. Human nature. ",5,5,5
I had a seizure when my glucose was below 20. So dr started me on T. I love it no ups and downs with my glucose.  I don’t ever have glucose reading over 140 but always had readings below 70 even after eating but T fixed that. Only thing is the shot hurts so dang bad. I put it in my arm. Any one else experience this? Does it hurt in the stomach? Or thigh?  I dread it!! But my hubby doesn’t want to wake to me seizing again and neither do I!!!!!,4,5,5
"My doctor put me on Trulicity in March, 2018 as an alternative to insulin.  I had seen this advertised and willing to try it especially to lose some weight.  The medicine worked great at lowering my levels and my A1c went from 10.5 to 8.5 in 3 months, so I appeared to be on the right track.  I lost about  5 lbs in 2 weeks, but I was so sick 3 days out of 7 that was not a great feat.  I complained to my doctor, who said this is a side affect and gave me pills to combat the nausea.  That worked for about 3 weeks and after that nothing happened.  The meds he gave me to combat nausea if what they prescribed to chemotherapy patients.  By the time, I stopped taking Trulicity, I was so sick I could barely function.  I took the shot on Wednesday morning and by Wednesday afternoon, I was sick until that following Monday.  Needless to say, my doctor took me off.  If he had not, I would have just stopped it myself.  He put me on Januvia and I have never felt better.  This medicine is dangerous.  I don't believe that any drug should make you feel this bad in order to feel better.",1,1,4
I love T.. I simply love it. last a1c was 5.8. since I started it in april I have dropped about 22 pounds. I don't have any sour stomach. my appetite is finally under control. I go out to eat and leavefull and leave most of the meal on the plate. I have more energy than I have had in years and over all. I give it five stars and I hope that I have many many years of good health on this medication. ,5,5,5
"So far I just started taking trulicity and havenâ??t had any side effects. I even question if the pen malfunctioned cuz I didnâ??t feel anything even tho I can see the plunger was down. After reading several websites on the reviews for this medicine I am getting worried cuz the negative reviews outlays the positive reviews. I didnâ??t know how to rate this medication since Iâ??ve only taken one dose with no side effects. But Iâ??ve seen reviews saying no side effects till after several doses, so who knows how this is going to work for me, since everyoneâ??s body reacts differently. Wish me luck. ",5,5,5
"Taking 2nd dose of .75 Trulicity today.  The first week was up and down.  Day 1 had some gastrointestinal upset, but it only lasted a couple of hours.  Each day of the week brought stomach upset and nausea at different times of day, not really at any specific time either.  No vomiting so far but on day 4 and 5 had so much gas coming up with belching and flatulence all day long!  The burps were sulfuric but not unbearable. I emailed my doctor and was told it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see lower BS results.  My A1C was 7.8 the last time I tested and my daily BS numbers are hovering between 180-250.  I take 2000 mg Metformin and 10 mg of Glipizide per day.  I am trying to stay on this drug for at least the full 8 weeks to give it a proper chance to work for me.  ",3,3,3
"Used more than three years.  No problems during that time and A1c always at 6 or lower.  Then I spent ten days in hospital ICU, had pancreatitis and sepsis and doctor told my wife he didnâ??t think I would make-it because of my age (87).  Well, I made it and feel terrific now.  I called Lilly and they were pretty insouciant.  Now Iâ??m on no DM meds and last A1c was 6.2.  No thanks to Trulicity.",5,1,5
I have been using Trulicty for several months now. In the begginig I had explosive diarrhea like some of the others. There were times I wanted to quit but then I remembered I had the same thing with Metphormin. I recently found giving myself in the leg is working better than my stomach. My A1C is in the normal range and I have lost about 12 pounds by doing nothing but using Trulicty. I should admit I am a Pepsi drinker. My advice is give it some time. It is working for me.  ,5,5,5
"Within the first 90 days of use, the drug worked perfectly.    To avoid the â??blahâ? feeling and the initial slight headache from the drug, I would do it on a Sunday Evening about an hour prior to going to bed and also take two aspirin.   I lost 10 -12 pounds initially, blood sugar levels dropped.    However, now all of a sudden I am experiencing bouts of explosive diarrhea with very short notice.    This has created problems for me when out for the evening or at work.     I have an upcoming doctor appointment and I am going to ask to try a different option, possibly metformin.    I will also mention that this drug is quite expensive, even with my health care plan where I work.   I have some serious concerns about the long term effects with Trulicity.",4,2,4
"Trulicity was easy to use and effective in lowering my blood glucose level, however, it gave me severe gastrointestinal problems, leading to a very costly hospitalization for eschemic colitis and unknown future repercussions.",1,1,1
The medication causes terrible pain during injection. This is from the medication not the needle.,3,3,4
"Trulicity has knocked my A1c to 6.1, steady. Also, since it's worked well for that, my MD decided that insulin is not required yet. It's easy to use. So that' the two five stars. The satisfaction rating is low, because the 24 hour after taking the shot, I'll be vomiting every hour or so for the day. I can put up with it, for the control, but it's not optimal.",5,2,5
"I have been taking for just over a month.  Used to take insulin 3-4 times daily, plue Levemir and metformin.  Now just a weekly Trulicty, Levemir shot daily and 1000mg of metformin.  BS's 100-130 through out the day.  Much smaller appetite.  Mild nausea 1 or 2 days after shot but last shot not at all.  I am so excited down from 120  shots a month to less than 40.  It has even been handling a small dessert every couple days.  I can't believe what a difference it has made for me. ",5,5,5
"I am amazed! I have had extremely high blood sugar for the past three years, despite diet and moderate exercise. My average was 350 with spikes up to 600. On my first week on Trulicity, four days in and my blood sugar is running in the mid 130's, with no addition insulin other than Lantius. Twice per day",5,5,5
"At first it worked well for me, lost weight A1C came down, then i started getting gastric symptoms which escalated and put me in the hospital, developed kidney stones. Energy and gastric issues slowly improving since stopping.  Came close to losing kidney due to severe diarrhea and resulting dehydration. NEVER AGAIN!!",1,1,1
This medication caused me to have bad stomach issues including severe indegestion and constant sour burping almost smelled like flatulence coming out my mouth horrible! Had diarrhea everyday. Despite side effects did reduce a1c and did lose weight but side effects outweighed the pros. ,1,1,1
"Bad This drug is harsh for the body. This is day four and my kidney hurt urine orange. I'm sleeping a lot.The first inject was bad. I was vomiting, stomach hurting and pooping. I moan all night. The only relief was sleeping. I'm glad when this is out of my system. If they had a rating for zero I would not give trulicity that. Please look at the other side effects. They should take this off the market. Reject!!!!!",1,2,1
The side effects are terrible. I won't take it again.  There's far less damaging options ,1,1,1
The drug seems to be okay this is my third we taking it in my second week taking it at a higher dosage my blood sugar is in one in Normal. My only issue is sometimes I get a little nausea but not a lot and I have lost like my appetite to eat so I lost 10 lbs already which is a great Plus I just want a little chocolate. But I can barely eat,5,4,4
"I was very sceptical about using this medication due to the side effects and using the pen however, the shot did not hurt and it was a relatively short process. I purchased some ginger tea and rice to coat my stomach before I took the shot and I took it two hours before bed. I purchased crackers to nibble on, but I haven't had any pain or sickness at all. I am sleepy though. My appetite and cravings for bad food have disappeared and I feel like I have more stored energy. Currently, I am pre-diabetic and I need to lower my A1C to be healthy again. I have changed my diet and I am exercising 4-5 times a week. ",4,5,4
"Why is there different information about Trulicity between European and US? Nothing is mentioned about not having to take daily blood monitoring in U.S. Plus the Elderly, there is a very limited therapeutic experiance. .75 mg is considered a starting dose. ",4,4,4
My sugars were running between 325 - 470 and I started Trulicity along with the Humalog and my sugar after a week and 1/2 was 145 this morning. I am very pleased. I have had no side effects to this point. I am even losing weight. Yay! ,5,5,5
I have been using this medicine for3 or 4 months now and has been great on keeping my numbers down with no side effects.,5,5,5
BE CAREFUL THIS DRUG COULD KILL YOU THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE HORRIBLE. IN BED FOR WEEKS AFTER USING THIS DRUG.  ,1,1,1
After approximately 14 months on Trulicity with great A1C 5.9 I started felling nauseated almost every day and vomiting for hours once or twice a week...The first 2 months on Trulicity lost 35# but 6 months later it all came back.  My doctor took me off it and since then my sugars have been terrible...I started on .75 but went up to the 1.5..This was only Diabetes med I have taken as had stomach problems from Metformin.  The doctor has currently ordered tests to rule out Pancreatitis and other possibilities.  I think its a great drug if you don't get these symptoms.  The endocrinologist I had seen for thyroid previously said he only puts people on Trulicity for no more than 6 months because not enough is known of the effects.,5,2,5
After one injection Friday I developed severe ketoacidosis and was hospitalized on Sunday vomiting up acid 4 times. Lilly refunded cost of unused medicine but not medical bills. ,1,1,1
Day 10 on Trulicity- I was expecting horrible side effects after reading reviews. I am really tired for the first two days after injection. I eat smaller healthier meals throughout the day and have no horrible side effects. I have no appetite. Mainly eating to keep numbers up. I have lost 10 lbs in 10 days. This has been a miracle drug for me!,5,5,5
"Januvia and metformin user with not so great numbers.  Severe stress jacked my fastings to 180-190. Doc put me on highest dose of T.

Have to force myself to eat a meal.  Day 5 tried to go Christmas shopping ended up sitting on floor in big box store eating fruit snacks, sweating so much wanted to disrobe- another bs drop. Loading my car was fun while trying to not vomit.  Lost 5 pounds. Pharmacist said should have started on lower dose and work up but my doc disagrees.  By the way my doc put me off for 2 weeks to let the medicine start working, I guess she knew what would happen.  Not sure if I will take another high dose-MIGHT be willing to try lower dose. ",4,3,4

Goal is to drop Januvia,and glipizide as the Blood glucose stays normal.5 pounds of weight loss is a pleasant side effect.Only side effect was a little nausea in the first 2 weeks.",5,5,5
No problems at all. Was nervous from reading reviews. Also take 2000mg of metformin,4,4,4
"No side effects at all.  It's like my stomach went to sleep - hunger pangs are gone.  Much easier to control my weight.  My insurance covers all the cost, so that it an advantage.  Also take 2000mg metformin.  May not be for everyone but I'm down 15 lbs after 2 months.",5,5,5
"To begin with, I took a smaller dose of Trulicity to bring down over all blood sugars. The dose was .75. Nausea, and indigestion was horrible for the first month I took it. I was put on promethesine for the nausea and stomach upset.Then, my Dr's PA decided to increase the dosage without warning. The nausea turned into projectile vomiting, severe stomach pain, bloating, etc. The entire side of my throat and glands was swollen and extremely painful. My doctor put me out of work for a week while I waited for the medicine to wear off. The whole time, nauseas, vomiting and worrying about thyroid cancer because of past history of it. I then had to go for a sonogram to make sure that the cancer has not returned. When they found 4 lymph nodes that showed up, that set the cancer watch on again. I have not yet had blood work to verify that it has not returned, that will happen in September. This has been Horrific and I would recommend this medication to NO ONE!!! CAVEAT EMPTOR!!! IT'S YOUR LIFE. Make an educated decision!!!",1,1,1
"Had no problems for the first fews weeks of taking Trulicity, but over the past 3 weeks, I have ongoing diarehha and have had vomiting eposides.  Lots of gas, burping all the time and bloated.  I ended up in the ER because the pains were so bad.  At the time, I didn't know it was Trulicity but I suspected it, only because it was the only thing/medication that had changed.  I loved the effectiveness of the drug, but it's not worth being sick all the time or my life.   I'm hoping to find something out there that will be more compatible with my system. ",5,1,5
"Exhaustion, vomiting, diarrhea, chills for 4 days after injection.  I thought that I was going to die.  Will never use again!",2,1,1
I have extreme nausea and pain after taking Truly city  I ended up going by ambulance to emergency where I spent several hours. I will never take it again.,2,1,2
"I've been a type 1 diabetic for 32 years and my doctor has recently put me on Trulicity (by that I mean I've taken 7 doses).  It has brought my numbers down, I've lost 9 lbs, I get the occasional bout of heartburn and egg burps, and I'm never hungry...like ever...I'm eating because I know I have to not because I'm hungry.  My only big complaint is with the delivery system. My first injection gave me a huge bruise so for my second dose I injected it into an unused syringe and then injected myself...seems to work and my doctor is ok with it so I'm going to keep doing it this way.",3,4,4
"I currently take Metformin, glimepride, jardiance and Trulicity.  I still have to eat an early perfect diet extremely low in carbs to have acceptable blood sugar numbers.  It's extremely frustrating and difficult to eat perfectly all the time.  I had an apple and peanut butter for a snack and my fasting sugar was 145.  I should be able to eat an apple!  I feel like this isn't working.",3,3,3
"My numbers are down since beginning Jan but started out with diarrhea and upper abdomen pain. Went away after 4 or 5 doses. Terrific weight loss but worried not getting enough greens. Then last week got flu but (had taken T in previous Wednesday) Diarrhea for about 12 hours... Then came the abdominal cramps. Bad cramps. Delayed next dose until Friday. Still flu like symptoms until today  have really bad abdominal cramps now. Tried the Pepto. No relief yet. I wonder if this is from combo of drugs... I take Farxiga also. Guess I will have    to wait out flu symptoms and go from there. I think T is incredibly easy to use, with no pain at injection site.  ",4,5,4
"I started trulicity 8 months back.HbA1c controlled to 6.0.Now every day I feel bloating and indigestion and burping with foul gas.I  consulted gastro.Dr informed me that this is due to gall bladder blockage or inflammation.I am now confused whether i should stop truclicity ,may be because of trulicity my gall bladder may not produce enough enzymes for digestion.Any one can help me ",5,5,5
"Now on week 5 and have experienced incredible dry mouth, which nothing seems to help.  Also experiencing acid reflux at night which sometimes keeps me up.  Eating a fraction of what I used to and not complaining about that.  ",4,4,4
None of the side effects others have had. Dropped my numbers by 50 points consistently. More energy and stamina. Trulicity is also curbing hunger as well as feeling full long after meals. Have to remember to stop eating full meals. I hope like most here it brings my numbers down to 6 or even 5 A1C levels. That has never happened in 13 years as diabetic.,4,5,4
I just started on this not sure if this the cause of the medication but I've been feeling extremely cold sometimes and usually I'm always hot and than hot. Also past few days my neck and body been aching a bit when sleeping I have to switch position all night I feel a bit light headed at times but other than that seems ok for now. ,3,3,3
"I had very bad abdominal issues, diarrhea alternating with constipation. Always tired. Gained 10 pounds.",4,1,1
I started 3 weeks ago with a little apprehension after reading the reviews but have been very happy with the results with little or no side effects.,5,5,5
"Been using for two months. No side effects for me so far. Have lost weight, simply from appetite being less. So far, very satisfied. ",5,5,5
"After day 5 with the nausea, diarrhea, sulfur burps, major stomach pain and vomiting.  I'm done. I'm wiped out tired. I also have Celiac Disease and continually bouts with Diverticulitis that I believe is exaserbating this process. I'm glad it works for others, but it's not for me.",1,1,1
"I started at .75 dosage and had mild nausea for a couple of months. Dosage has been increased to 1.5, and the nausea did not return. I have lost 16 pounds and my A1c went from 8.5 to 6.5.  Very happy! ",5,5,5
"Have used Trulicity 1.5 for nearly a year (10 months?).  Other than the horrible expense, this medicine is extremely easy to use, nearly painless 1x week injection.  Drug company does have a rebate program where I receive $150 back after submitting invoice, but still way out of range to what it should cost.  But I will keep using it.  Previously used Bydureon -- NEVER AGAIN!!  ",5,4,5
"Its been causing me severe constipation. It might cause more problems. Constipation doesn't let me sleep, concentrate on my work, severe pain in the stomach make me feel that it caused me more issues in my body. My sugar level is not affected that much. I was in normal routine of going to gym, but since I started taking Triplicity, my energy level is so low that I want to just relax all the time. Lost about 8 kilos in 3-4 months. U believe their study is incomplete. Doctors take a note.",1,1,1
"3 months in, and no side effects. Feel better after getting off metformin. Appreciate the pen, easy to use. Wish it was out sooner.",4,4,4
Have been on T for approx 9 months.Started with .75 and minimally nautious.First 4 mo. Experienced very minimal nausea. Dose was raised to 1.5 after approx 5 mo.due to A1C was still 6.5 and weight loss after 15 lbs had stopped.Now have lost 26 lbs (8 lbs from my goal)but the often nausea is still there.I get very loose stools at least once a weak.Would be the perfect drug without those side effects.I will live with them for now.,4,4,4
"Liked the drug and ease of use.  Side effects were unbearable..and they appeared to be cumulative.  Abdominal pain, GERD , constipation. Each week got worse so I had to stop..but I liked the appetite suppressant.",4,4,4
may cause thyroid issues hene dont take,1,1,1
"Started with two weeks of 75mg and then started on the 150mg for three weeks.  I constantly had an upset stomach, usually puke at least once a week, had signs and lab tests after indicated results similar with pancreatitis. I have not puke so much and felt so terrible ever.  Lost weight tho, 500 cal a day of crackers, yogurt, water will do it and still puke it up. When I felt good I felt real good but never for long.  I like the approach to it but may have increased dosage to soon",4,1,4
"I heard about this shot from my Dad who also struggled with T2 Diabetes (his A1C is now a 5!). I just took my 4th shot today (0.75 mg) and I feel the best I have felt in YEARS!! My blood sugar has dropped significantly and I have more energy. I have also lost 14 pounds since starting. When I first started, I did have some nausea and cramping but it has become less with every dose I take. My appetite has changed and I have noticed that the first few days after my shot, I have virtually no appetite. I simply remind myself to at least eat a small meal and I feel fine.  ",5,5,5
"Easily my most horrible medication experience.  Had expected appetite loss, constant bloated feeling and daily nausea. Day after 4th shot, my digestive system shut down completely.  I am praying for the last dose to wear off so I can defecate once again.  Eating only liquids for past 2 days & constipation treatments have produced no results.",4,1,4
"I must say that after reading reviews here, I was terrified to begin Trulicity. But once a week has been a liberating experience rather than twice-daily Byetta. I feel so free! I just started my third week, increasing now to the 1.5 dose. As far as I can tell, I've experienced none of the side effects mentioned. A.M. fasting BS numbers are definitely lower. I haven't noticed a change in appetite either way. I experience mild nausea on occasion, as well as minor diarrhea, but I've had that for some time so no change there. In fact, I have taken Pepto-Bismol as suggested by one of the reviewers, and that seems to have helped. I can't wait for next A1C. I expect good improvement. So far good results.",5,5,5
"This drug truly works for me, Easy to use, A1C down from 11 to 5.1 in 4 months",5,5,5
"My doctor asked me to try this medication and it was a game changer for me. I felt better than any other medication I've previously or since tried. My A1C went down, my daily checks were good, I started losing weight and I had energy unlike I'd had in years prior. I was highly impressed with it's effectiveness. I didn't experience a lot of issues mentioned here... I regularly deal with nausea so that wasn't new for me, but I can confirm that it is a possible side effect. The worst thing about Trulicity is that my insurance refuses to pay for it. My mother is now having the same problem with Medicare. The drug works, the insurance not so much.",5,5,5
"I love this drug! I had some nausea at first, but now in my 6th month of taking it I rarely get sick. Appetite has decreased significantly and have lost 28lbs so far. My MD decreased Metformin in half about 2 months ago and may need to decrease Lisinopril also. A1C went from 8.6 to 6.2. My only issue with the drug is the itching and redness at the sight of injection, but will keep taking it because nothing has ever worked for me like this drug!",5,4,5
"Trulicity has been a life changer for me.  I have been on it for about 10 months and have lost 42 pounds.  It has decreased my appetite dramatically.  I used to be hungry all the time.  Now, if I over eat, it is for psychological reasons only, never for hunger. I have had nausea all along but only very early in the morning, one or two days after my injection.  Then I'm fine.  Anti-nausea meds my doctor prescribed were very helpful but now I just go it on my own.  I've learned to alter some of my routines to help prevent it - like not taking all my meds right before bedtime. Constipation has been an issue at times, but it is helped dramatically by eating yogurt daily and stool softeners occasionally.  Before Trulicity my A1C was up to 14, now it is below 7.  This is the most effective treatment I have ever experienced and I am grateful for it.",5,5,5
This medication has been great. The first month was difficult but the results were really good for lower bs. Increased the dose and doing well. I have been on this for 6 months.,5,5,5
"3days after first dose of Trulicity I had projectile vomiting and sulpher burps, constant nausea and diarrhea for 3 days.  After next shot the same thing.  I didn't want to quit the medicine as my fasting blood sugar were 90-120 for the first time in years.  Then I discovered the answer, Pepto-Bismol.  It's like a miracle.  Stops the rotten egg burps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Now I just take a dose of it right after my shot and again the next morning if I feel queasy.  I'm a nurse and can't believe that good old Pepto works so great.  Just be aware that it might make you tongue and bowel movements black. ",5,3,5
I had been on Glucophage for years and it finally quit working. I was told to take this with the Glucophage 2 mths ago. It lowered the BS from 350  down to 190 so increased the dose per Dr. and now is even lower. The side effects are terrible and hope the nausea and tiredness ends. I feel like I will vomit almost constantly. Bloating also. Not sure I can continue on it due to feeling like crap all the time. I am hoping the side effects will end. As for weightloss I have had that but it is because I take a few bites of food and feel ready to throw up.,5,3,4
First dose went smoothly. Next day terrible headache and my joints began to hurt. Several weeks in now and I feel like I've been run over by a truck. My joints hurt terribly. I am so sleepy and tired all the time even though my routine has not changed. I have diarrhea daily and have actually gained weight. My numbers have not gone down and I've discussed coming off but my doctor wants me to keep trying. I think I need another opinion. ,2,1,2
"Only two days into this regimen,  and I am experiencing almost certainly what must be the side-effects:  constant flatulence,  loss of appetite-- no food sounds particularly good to me at present--   and a constant belching which brings up a nasty, stale taste in my mouth,  which actually reminds me of stale blood,  truth told.",5,3,4
"Doctor says it takes a week to start working. Day one, disoriented. Day two, headache and nausea. Day three, less headache and less nausea. Day four, no headache and intermittent nausea. Day five, intermittent nausea and constipation. Day six, intermittent nausea and constipation that concerns me. No effect on blood sugar yet. Will see what happens with second injection in two days.",1,1,1
"2nd week on Trulicity.  First week nausea, integestion, lack of appetite.  I'm planning on staying on this medication for a reasonable amount of time 4-6 weeks. Lowers my BS sufficently.",4,3,3
"I just started my 2nd week on Trulicity.  Because of some of the comments, I was very apprehensive about starting the drug.  During my first week I had bouts of nausea but no vomiting and I could work through them.  A Malox tab help.  The nausea lessened as I approached the second dose day.  On my second dose day (Sat.), I had one minor nausea but now, 3 days after dose 2, I have no nausea at all.  The only thing that I notice now is that my stomach gets a little cranky at meal time, before I eat and my appetite seams a bit suppressed which is good.  My A1C was 8 something.  I am anxious to see what it will be at the next test.  P.S. I just had a favorite aunt pass away because of diabetes complications at much too early an age.  I am paying now paying attention!",3,3,3
"I have been using this medication since mid February and haven't had problems until now I take my shot every Thursday. Sunday night the sulphur burps started I knew these from being on victoza. Then diarrhea all day today, I am disappointed that I am getting these side effects this medication has helped lower my A1c and lose weight. I will take it this Thursday but if I continue to get the side effects I will not continue. It was a nightmare on victoza.",5,4,5
 Been taking med foe 2.5 weeks.Blodd sugar levels went from 150-180 down to 80-110. Nausea and constipation are the main side effects I have experienced. Went from 4 bowel movements per day to 1 bowel movement every other day. Nausea is usually only at night time. I have gained 2 lbs so far.,4,4,5
"I've been on Trulicity now since 21st of march. We have a program in our town that helps you with getting expensive drugs i would normally never be able to afford.You might want to check where you live at your DHS. I had used Victoza as a 3 week free sample and recently Faxigia. I picked the once weekly injection Trulicity over Victoza's daily shot and Faxigia's once daily pill. I don't seem to have any side effects others complained about but did notice Victoza did curb my hunger better. Truicity seems to make me nauseous after about 15 minutes of eating a large meal? Victoza kinda made me feel nauseous and not want to eat. As i'm insulin resistant i'm all alot meds like 30mg Actos, 2000mg Metformin, 2mg Glimepiride daily.  The doctor has lowered my Novolin N morning injection from 120 units to 70 and evening injections from 80 units to 30 because of my lower glucose numbers. I've had several low glucose events both day and nightly and i go back the 26th of this month for a A1-C to see about adjusting my meds.",5,5,5
"After the 2nd weekly dose, I had a bad case of gout in my lfeft foot. Also, all my joints were hurting me 10 times worse than usual. I also noticed that I was having wierd thoughts. I stopped taking it after the third week. It has been two weeks now since I stopped taking it and I feel almost back to normal.",1,1,1
"Horrible nausea. Constipation. Had to stop using it.  It was moderately effecting at reducing blood glucose, but how much of that was because I was hardly eating anything.",2,2,3
Started having palpitations with this med. severe hoarseness and difficulty swallowing. Chest pains daily. Had to stop taking this med.,5,1,2
Love the results of this medication just wish there was some way to reduce the injection pain.,1,5,5
"Horrible gastric issues , heartburn, reflux and severe  bloating.",5,1,1
I've been on this now for about 3 months. My morning fasting blood sugars have been higher since I started with an average now of 183. I'll be taking another A1C this week and expect it will increase. Previously it was at 7.3 but I was on another weekly injection. Hopefully my doctor will change or modify my treatment.,5,1,1
"My sugar levels went from the 200's to normal. There have been some lows because I had to adjust my Novalog down with meals. I don't need half the novalog I use to. My only complaint is the 10 seconds of pain when injecting. Wow, it hurts. No weight loss, but at least sugar levels are almost cut in half, and no big highs since I started. It's been 5 weeks and no side effects. I think this is a great drug.",5,5,5
"HYPOGLYCEMIA is not an issue with me so the medication gets all 5-Stars from me.  My blood sugar has gone from the mid 200's to 150 every morning.  It works well with Jardiance and metformin.  I'm on the 1.5 dose and nausea is not an issue.  Weight loss is also much easier with these drugs, which helps lower the readings too.    Great drugs by Eli Lilly and the insurance company recommended them to me, as cost effective treatment.  They got that right and I am in.",5,5,5
from week one worked to get my blood sugar down first few days did not feel well at all stayed with it dr and insurance co wanted me to try it longer long story short blood pressure sky high had ekg showed inferior wall MI had Catherization lucky no damage don't use this crap insurance co made them out me back on Victoza yay or I was going to sue them ,1,1,1
"I am a person with Type 1 and started to use this drug 3 weeks ago to help with weight loss. The first week I had a very mild upset stomach, but nothign some ginger-ale couldn't fix.  I have so far had no other side effects.  I feel full, not bloated.  I find I have been eating more slowly, and feel full faster.  No bloat (not to be confused with feeling full). No pains, nothing else.  I have shed a few pounds but not sure if it's a result of the things I just wrote, or else.  But, I look forward to seeing what happens.",5,5,5
"This is the beginning of my 4th week. My blood sugar was almost impossible for me to get below 150 prior to starting Trulicity. exactly 1 week after starting my blood sugar was perfect! 30 day average of 138, 14 day average 128. I have been in touch with myself to find any kind of side effect. I have not been able to find one. I am so happy!",5,5,5
A1c from 770 to 620 over 6month period,5,5,5
Started with small dose injection. Blood sugar went from 170/180 to 250/275 almost immediately.Doctor changed dose to larger dose injection. Blood sugar climbed again. I also felt real bad and had issues with my legs and balance. Stopped the injections and went back to orals. Blood sugar now in the 135/155 range. I WILL NOT USE THIS MEDICATION AGAIN.,3,1,1
"I have been on this drug for 5 weeks.  It has worked really well at lowering my numbers from morning high of 130 to 80's.  I reduced my Lantus from 35mg X2/day to 10 once a day.  I do have the nausea and vomiting for the first couple days after the injection each week.  However, the biggest issue that I have had is sever constipation! I went from normal daily BM's to once a week!  I tried every trick in the book, Meralax, stool softeners 4/a day, drinking 90oz of water, more fiber, etc. you name it I tried it.  My doctor has stopped the drug for a month to see if I return to normal functions.   ",5,4,5
works wonderfully..sugar is in control with metformin,5,5,5
"This is my third week.  I took the low dose the first two weeks and the higher dose this week.  Reading the reviews definitely scared me.  I haven't had a single problem.  I get very slightly nauseous for about five minutes after the shot, then I'm fine.  My blood sugar is wonderful.  The lower dose didn't effect my appetite, but the higher dose does.  This is not a negative!  I did notice that the lower dose wore off the day before the next shot.  I'm curious to see if the higher dose does the same.  In all, I'm very surprised that it works so well.",5,5,5
"No energy, No appetite.  Did lower sugars, couldn't tolerate the side effects",5,1,5
"Started Trulicity October 2015. A1C was 12 and had finally gotten Lantus fro 50 to 10. In addition, also take metformin 2000mg per day. Along with diet and exercise (cardio, weight training, ect), my A1C is now at 6 and I am off the Lantus. I started on the .75 dose for 2 weeks before moving to 1.5. Nausea was initially fairly mild but persistent for first 3 weeks. After that, no problem. Definitely kills the appetite. I was practicing portion control and found I eat even less. Psychologically, it pains me to have to take medication, but this is what is needed for now and is working. I try to think of it as a tool. My goal is to be medication free.",5,4,5
"I took trulicity since June 2015 after spending a week in the hospital for an infections cysit and was on IV drugs. Blood sugars in the 350  range. Five injections of isulin (3 of Novalog,2 of Levimire). Were ineffective. Last ditch effort by my doctor was to try Trulicity.  Overnight blood sugars went to 116. Stayed low after each weeks injection. A1C went from 13 to 7. No real bad side effects,loss of appetite, major weight loss after 6 months (60  lbs.) Stopped taking on my own 50 days ago without doctors knowledge, Blood sugars leveled out to high 110s to 120s",5,5,5
"The drug from hell....severe nausea, mega headaches, vomiting.  I wii not take another injection",1,1,1
"Just started and on second dose, within days I becgn to gain weight a pound every day. I noticed my legs were swollen and they felt thick and heavy, I also felt hyper. Second shot 8th day swelling in hands and eyes now too, so I called doctor and now moving onto Tanzeum. If your not allergic, it did a wonderful job of stopping hunger. Good Luck!",3,1,3
"I have taken for 2 months. I am mostly satisfied. Less urination than invokana. I have mild lower back pain. Overall I feel pretty good. Sugars are down to low 100's in morning and low 140's after lunch. I take .75 mg weekly, with 2000 mg metformin daily. Jury is still out but no severe side effects and energy ok. I do have a weird metallic taste after eating? I lost weight on invokana but it sapped my energy. So far weight is stable on trulicity and a1c is 6.6.",4,4,4
"My first injection on Friday...sick stomach and diarrhea on Sunday. All of that lasted the entire week. Second injection on Friday, sick stomach and indigestion on Sunday. On Tuesday, I felt human again, everything back to normal. I'm eating half of a meal instead of the whole thing and I'm not craving anything. I have lost weight and am feeling so much better. For anyone skeptical about this, please at least give it a try...may take a couple of weeks to level out, but it's worth it!",5,5,5
"1st injection Wed, vomiting by Fri.. second injection following Thur (so as not to miss work again) sick Sun.. 3rd injection thur.. giving it one more chance.. fasting 160 down from 200.. no weight loss, terrible bloat.. retaining fluid in hands. Nausea worse if I eat..I try not to eat for couple days after shot don't understand why no weight loss.. I see new endo dr in Jan, hope I can continue with this med till then..",5,2,3
"On drugs.com the truth about this horrible medicine is there. 38 reviews about vomitimg, nausea, stomach pain, bloating, and the runs. These side affects put people in the hospital and I will no let my husband take it.",1,1,4
I'm not sure what is happening but my vision it's hard to focus since I've taken my second shot it's hard to drive because I cannot focus when I look down has anybody else had this kind of side effect with this medication I went to the eye doctor he gave me an eye exam my vision is 20 20 there is no explanation for the vision problems that I am having the only new medication I've been taking is trulicity.,5,2,2
"I have been on this drug for 2 months. It wipes out your appetite altogether. And I found it difficult to force myself to eat. I haven't felt any relief from diabetic foot/nerve pain. But my glucose levels have been low; below 100 in the mornings and no higher than 140 at night. I do take this weekly along with my nightly insulin. I was hesitant at first about why I needed to try this, but if you can deal with the no appetite and tiredness; it works.",5,4,5
"This medication dropped my sugar from 300-475 down to the low 100's -150 depending on the time of day. I've lost 24lbs in three months. I've had extreme fatigue but it's worth it. I don't have as much nerve pain as I did, and I can almost feel my fingertips again. Lack of appetite is amazing, I eat because I have to not because I want to. The pen is another huge plus. Needles give me anxiety, but this I can handle. ",5,5,5
Used for a month so far.  My fasting blood sugar level has went from way over 300 to under 100.  Have also lost weight.  I have not experienced the side effects some have.,5,5,5
"Wish I had been warned about the side effects. My readings have dropped from 235 - 255 to 170 on 1st day to now on 6th day to 140. However it has felt like a war going on in my body, fever, sick, tired etc. I have been in bed since day 2 and cannot see any end to this. Do I take my 2nd dose?",4,1,4
"Had all the side effects, not good, way too much pain!!!",4,1,4
the side effects make me miserable it keeps my numbers down I am not happy with the way I feel,5,1,5
"I love this. It has not only brought down my readings from 300 and 400 to 130 and lower, but my weight has dropped from 230 to 195. I do experience low readings due to lack of wanting food. But I have set alarms that remind me to eat. I have only one side effect and that is some burping sometimes. I can live with this. Love, Love, Love.  P.S. My A1C is way down too...9 down to 6.8. doing great, am due another A1C this month.",5,5,5
"I've been on Trulicity for a week now.  No nausea, no cravings, no bad side effects as of yet.  I'm not as hungry. While testing my sugar, it seems to be working awesomely.  I go back in 2 months for blood work.  I have also lost 6 lbs in the first week.  This is the only med for diabetics to help me.  ",5,5,5
the side effects are miserable but it does bring down my numbers.,5,1,5
This drug helped me to lose 5 lbs in one week. It controls my sweet tooth and evens out my sugars because I no longer feel the shakes when I don't eat on time but I still get headaches sometimes. I am happy with the outcome.,4,5,5
I have been using it for almost 6 months now. I have lost considerable amount of weight. Glucose levels are down very well. A1C down to 5.4 from 7.8. I use it with Metformin. I was on Bydureon previously it caused me a lot of bumps and skin reactions. Trulicity is a blessing and the ease of use is great!,5,5,5
Frist week on the pen. It seems great I am not having that craving for sweets. I don't feel as hungry. I believe it's going to be great. My blood sugars are down from 200 to 130's. Will get back in 3 months when I do the A1C.,5,5,5
"I had been on Victoza but couldn't continue because of the nausea.  I was also taking Lantus.  I started on Trulicity two weeks ago and had no nausea, have more energy and my blood sugars are in range.  I no longer take lentos either.",5,5,5
I loved Victoza. It helped with hungry control too. Unfortunately my insurance won’t cover it and I can’t pay over $600/month. ,5,5,5
"Was told to start at .6 for two weeks. Started at .3 to check for allergies.  That has made me so sick and nauseated I am going back to .1 and will try to work up to a decent size dose,but its going to take a while.  Injecting was way less painful than testing blood sugar ",2,1,4
It seems to have caused insomnia and can't get to sleep before 4am,5,3,5
"I have taking 1.2 dose of victoza for a year now, I was taking junuvia but it didn't do nothing for me and metforim gave me a severe diarrhea so my dr. switched me to lantus and victoza I'm very happy with the victoza I've had no side effects and I've lost 53 pounds in the last year",5,5,5
I was totally satisfied while taking Victoza. My A1c was staying around 6.1. It also kept my weight down.  Unfortunately after 2 years it had caused my Liver Function levels to elevate and go out of range and I had to come off of it.  It is very sad and stressful since now I have to try something new.,5,5,5
I have been taking this for 2 months at the 1.2 dose. I have not had any side effects at all. I have lost weight and my numbers are good. I can't wait to find out what my A1C is!,5,5,5

"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (POS) years ago. Last year, I was referred to a doctor that specializes in this disease; at the time I first met him, I weighed a whopping 387 pounds (I’m 5’10’’). Of course, the first thing he told me was that my POS would get better if I lost weight. I was totally discouraged! I told him that I was very active and had been on EVERY diet… nothing seemed to work. I was so frustrated and asked if there was anything he could do to jump start my weight loss from a medical stand point. This is when he told me about Victoza and about the study that demonstrated that individuals suffering from POS, not from Type 2 diabetes had lost weight on this medication but there were some serious side effects to consider. I was so desperate that after reading on the matter for a few days, I decided to try it out. The first months were pretty horrible because I had severe nausea and vomiting (in the morning upon waking I would throw up stomach acid – I know erk!) but I decided to continue. The reason I kept up with it is that, for the first time in my life, I could sense that I was full when I ate. For some reason, this message was not making its way up to my brain when I ate before… I thought it was awesome. The medication no only killed every craving I normally had but it stopped me from overeating. I have been on Victoza for one year now. The side effects are no longer there (they stopped after about 6 months after starting Victoza) and I now weigh 276 pounds… yes I lost over 100 pounds. I am continuing to lose weight and wish you all the best. ",5,5,5

"I started on 0.6 a week and worked my way up to 1.8 a week. I haven't had any bad side effects with this medication. No nausea, no sickness. I did have a slight headache the very first week I started. It hasn't help me lose any weight but it has kept my blood sugar under control.",5,5,4
"Was on 4 oral medications for my diabetes, and after several years of good control, my numbers started to increase. Started Victoza and even before moving up to 1.28 dose, my numbers immediately dropped about 30 pts,and I lost about 7 lbs in first week. Only side effects were some minor nausea, and a couple days of diarrhea,but both passed after a week or so. The sugar control remains good (averaging about 110) but unfortunately the weight loss stopped. The dosages for my oral medications have dropped, and some may be eliminated. My medicare advantage plan only provides partial coverage (tier II drug)but the drug is worth it. Of course, I hope I never develop the more serious long-term side effects, but the long-term side effects of uncontrolled diabetes are pretty bad also.  ",5,4,4
"I want to thank God for my Dr. Iam pre diabeta, been on Victoza for 9 days loss 9lbs. I could not lose any weight.The only side affect, I am never hungry.  ",5,5,5
"Hello. I heard some great things about victoza and some really bad things so I decided to try it out and hope for the best. Sad to say that I simply couldn't stand all the side effects that I encountered while on it. I felt like I was in a daze all the time and the nausea was really bad. I completely lost my appetite and after a week I started to throw up multiple times a day. I decided to stop because it simply made me sick to my stomach. I did some research on the internet to try and find something over the counter without side effects. I found this supplement called cinnalife which so far has been amazing for me. My A1C has significantly dropped which i'm sure is a large part due to the energy that this supplement gives me. I have been very active since I started taking them. Anyways, just wanted to share that there are always alternatives to these injectables with these horrible side effects. I have heard that there are some new injectables out in the market, but I'm simply too scared to try them =(",4,1,1
not sure if I have to eat before or after I give my injection. ,5,5,5
i have been taken victoza for a lil over 2 months now and i have lost 22lbs my a1 is where it needs to be and my sugar levels are in a good rage the only down side to me using this is i have sever joint pain from head to toe about once a week or once every 2 weeks im not sure if anyone has this same problem or not but i really do not like it at all i have to stay in bed all day and it hurts so bad if someone touches me or i have to move other than that it works great.,5,3,5
"For those who cannot afford Victoza, go to Victoza website and get coupon to never pay more than $25.  That's what I did'",5,5,5
"The Victoza did help decrease my blood sugar numbers nadmy A1C, but I had a massive amount of side effects that I didn't know was being increased by the Victoza because the Victoza was started around the same time that I was also having gallbladder issues, and had a gall stone. After my gallbladder removal I remained sick with the same symptoms I had prior to it of: heartburn, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, severe foul smelling belching, and gas. This continued for some time, and my doctor decided to remove me off my Victoza because my diabetes #'s, and A1C were getting to a level of satisfaction for her.   I remained off my Victoza for about a month, and my blood sugar numbers began to gradually creep up again, so my doctor decided to put me back on it.   I had finally became free of the side effects listed above, but still not relating them to the Victoza.  Then my wife, who is a RN said the she was getting ready to give me a Victoza injection, and wanted me to let her know if any of the symptoms that I'd had for so long returned.  Within 30 mins of receiving the Victoza injection I again started having foul smelling belching, gas, and began vomiting profusely.    Victoza is an awesome drug, and does what it's suppose to do.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is able to take it, but if you have anything weird start happening within your body once you start taking it, you can bet money that the Victoza Will be what's causing it.",1,1,4
"Don't even start taking this! I took Victoza for ten months. I feel like I have lost ten months of my life. It started with diarrhia, vomiting. I just felt yuck all day. then the hives started. I've gone to the hospital four times in ten months. That doesn't even include hives that didn't send me to the ER.  So everyday feeling not great, the last trip to the ER was in a ambulance because the reaction caused me to pass out. I lost a little weight, but when you are always nausea and diarrhea and vomiting, of course you will loose weight. I feel like I was a guinia pig with this drug. Just stay away from it, it was life changing. After not taking it for three weeks now, I feel so much better. Not even a stomach ache!!!",1,1,2
"Began with such hope, but turned to nausea day 1, tired & lack of energy. The next few days went to nausea, bloating, stomach cramps, etc. affected my ability to work for several days.

A1C dropped from 6.7 to about 6.1. Morning glucose readings run 105-120.  Seems to be working great, but concerned about long-term side effects.  Still, high sugar levels are known to do much damage long term, so plan to stay with what's now working.",5,4,4
"Side effects experieced is many sour stomachs with gas bloating,so tired, I'm on 2 months lots of nausia, not able to continue on this drug, just not for me.",4,2,3
Works great but giving me violent hiccups :( both at 0.6 and 1.2 dose.,5,4,5
"I was given Victoza by my diabetes specialist for my type 2 diabetes as he hoped it would help me lose weight. I am also taking insulin.  However, my nausea turned quickly to vomiting and dizziness.  I continued in the hope these symptoms would go away.  I was certainly losing weight but at great cost.  Finally, I was so weak I had to be rushed to the emergency room.  I was severely dehydrated and my blood pressure was so low the doctor there put me on intravenous fluids. AS soon as I stopped the Victoza I began to feel better and am now feeling pretty ok.  Dizziness, dehydration and extreme low blood pressure went away. Just as well, because right before all this, I had gone to the drug store to fill my prescription for Victoza (till then my doctor had given me samples) and I found out it was going to cost $600 to fill!  Needless to say, I can´t afford this.  I live on social security and a small pension. ",4,1,1
"Sugar dropped like a rock. Run 70-90. Lost about 15 lbs. Side effects- constipation, ""sour stomach"" belching. Feel like food sits in stomach for hours.  If low sugar occurs, eating or drinking doesn't help.  Just have to suspend insulin pump and hope for the best.  ",4,3,4
"Love this med!  Down 40 lbs. so far and was able to come off Metformin.  BG has stabilized even more since I'm off the Metformin!  Be sure to use the tiny ""nano"" needles, I don't even feel them. A1C was 5.6!",5,5,5
This has been like a wonder drug for me. Besides no appitite. Makes it difficult to eat when you know you have to but there is no desire.  Lost weight and A1C is impressive.Tried Byetta first and thought I was slowly dieing from the side effects this one has not done that to me. ,5,4,5
"I have been on this medication starting my 3rd week--I have lost 7 pounds and feel full when eating very little. Have had some minor headaches and nausea, when this happens I eat a couple of crackers and it goes away. They just increased my dosage to 1.8 will see what happen next. Sugars have been okay. But I like it so far.",5,5,4

I've been on Victoza for 2 months. My blood sugars are good and I've been able to eliminate glyburide and cut my insulin from 25 units twice a day to 10 twice a day. I've been able to follow a diet and eat less and have lost 24 lbs so far. ,5,5,5
"It lowered mu A1c considerably. I lost 10 lbs., then no more. The only thing I don't like is the high cost. After 3 mos. I'm in the donut hole already & have to pay over $600. for a 3 mo. supply.",5,4,4

"I have had type 2 diabetes for 15 years.  Have had no side effects in the 5 months I've been using Victoza.  Unfortunately, has not been effective at all; glucose readings remain the same.  Will be discussting w/my doctor tomorrow.  ",3,1,1
"I HATE needles, so this is alittle hard for me to do every morning ... but my glucose levels after eating takes less than 2 hrs to be in the normal range of 100 - 120. Very happy with that!",2,4,5
"I have been taking this since New Years Eve. My sugar was above 275 and the first dose dropped my down to 87. The morning sugar is between 87 and 100 now. The only side effect I have had is the constipation. I don't drink any sodas, not eating any sugars and stopped the pastas and starches, this was my choice to try and make myself healthier. I still take metformin twice a day. I have lost weight, I don't know how much but my clothes are getting very loose. I hope to get where I won't have to continue taking this or the meds. They say its possible",5,5,5
"I have been on this drug for two weeks now, the first week at .6 and now 1.2 for the next 2 months then I see my dr. again. But I can speak for the last two weeks and call them a big whopping success!! Yes, there is belching and nausea, it has faded. I have diarrhea, it has not faded. The  so worth it part: blood sugars are down from 405 to 157....in TWO weeks! I do not know about weight loss amounts..haven't weighed yet. Certainly feel thinner and my pants feel looser. Prior to this drug, I was on Januvia, novolog, and metformin. Kept only the metformin (1000mg 2x day) and added this Victoza. I know this isn't the perfect drug with the side effects, but it is an answer for me.   Major tip: eat small...and I mean small...meals throughout the day. Drink slowly in between the meals. The only time I have vomited was on the second day when I ate a bowl of soup and then drank three cups of tea right away....I won't do that again!!  And don't even attempt a six inch subway sub in one sitting. I won't do that again either. I swear this drug is like a lap-band you inject! :))))",5,5,5
"Doc switched me to Victoza from Byetta to bring down expense.  Nice not to have to take but once a day.  Taking 1000 Metformin twice a day as well.  Lost 10 pounds after starting Victoza, just as I did for Byetta (but lost 30 then).  Took Victoza for 13 months. Quit because my husband and friends said my mouth smelled like a sewer; I had thought it was just me tasting it, but they could smell it as well.  I was belching a lot, flatulence as well.  But that taste was what drove me back to Byetta.  Weight loss stops pretty fast; I think it is a side effect of the nausea making you not eat, not the drug doing something swell.  Lots of itching in the last 6 months of taking it.  Didn't change my morning blood sugar levels any better than Byetta or just Metformin, which were 120 and doc wanted below 100.  Turns out morning high due to predawn low while sleeping, causing the sugar to swing high.  This is a known phenomena; if it's just your morning sugars high, consider that. Victoza good for 3-4 months, then just like other meds.  Expensive.  Insurance company gave me hell continually about finding an alternative. Beware the sewer mouth. (I guess things were staying in the stomach so long, they were beginning to rot.)  Have your friends/spouse check your breath.",4,1,3
"Have been on 1.2 for 8 months.A1C went from 6.8 to last week of 4.4. Only taking Victoza. Since A1C was so low, Dr took me off all meds for diabetes. I did suffer constipation but that is from stomsch staying full. ",5,5,5

I have been taking this drug for a year now.  The first two weeks were horrible but I am use to it now.  Blood glucose  has gone down a little (using 1.8mg dose) and lost some weight.  Still having issues with throat feeling swollen and heartburn twice a week.  I do not like injecting myself in the stomach.....my doctor states that is the place he wants me to administer the drug.,2,3,3

Third week of Victoza. Stomach pain is really bad. Head ache for the first week but is now gone. But the stomach pain and wanting to vomit is horrible. I am also having hiccups ,5,1,2
I take this to control sugar levels after eating. The first use my sugar level dropped to the normal range. It has increased my general sense of well being and side effects are minimal. I tried this after failing miserably with byetta.  Bonus is the weight loss.,5,5,5

"Have been on Victoza for a little over 30 days. statrted with 0.6mg and went to 1.2 after using up 1st pen. have just started 3rd pen (1.2mg) and only side-effects are some vertigo and mild constipation. not certain if either are related to increased dosage, but suspect the vertigo may be as my sugar has dropped from an average of 170+ to 123 for the past 30 days. I am impressed with the quick return to more normal sugar and have labs coming up in 2 weeks so will be interested in seeing what A1C will be. also take 1mg of Glimmepride after 1st meal. I hope the vertigo will pass but will discuss with Doctor after labs. ",3,4,5

"Take this drug! Although the first two weeks were terrible. I was nauseated and wretched, I kept having to cry, and had insomnia. There is a light at the end of the 2week tunnel! It really does curb your appetite. It does this by slowing down your stomach so you feel full on a quarter of a NY bagel. I was finally able to eat just 3 small saucer sized meals. I had always tried to cut down portion size before, but couldn't because i would get hungry. Not now!  Drink plenty of water in little sips all day. I dropped to 1dose of lantus at night and totally cut out humolog fast acting insulin. Still take 2000 mgs metformin but was switched to the time released kind today. My numbers went from the 200's to 120 first thing in the morning and 135 2 hours after dinner. I've lost 15lbs now and i'm in my third week.

Will hang in there, but this is not fun.  Needles don't hurt, lancets are much worse.  Really expensive.",4,2,4
The victoza shot made me feel so much better. The shot was easy and painless. But the side effects were terrible. I had severe migrain headaches and stomach pain. I took victoza for some time and then just could not tolerate it anymore. Every person is different though. My husband takes this shot and has no problems at all. He feels better and glad that he started it. So try it and stick with it for a time and then decide if it is right for you. Each person reacts differently to medications. As Christians we thank God for Dr.s and medications. We also know that God heals miraculously when He chooses too. What is most important is that we receive salvation Romans 10:9-10. (www.intouch.org),5,1,5
I was put on insulin for glucose levels ranging between 250-400 but insulin only would raise my sugars 100 points on the average. I tried 3-5 different kinds and none worked. Finally my doctor prescribed Victoza and the first day they dropped from 250+ average to 175! i used .6 for a week and stayed at 200. I then went up to 1.2 dose and sugars are staying in 160 range after few days! My glucose numbers also used to jump all over the place but now are stabling out. I have had queasy stomach but after about 1/2 hr or so it settles down and seems to calm as my system adjusts. I have only been on it a couple weeks.,5,5,5
This medication is a good drug! it works for me! I've been taking it for 3 years,5,5,5

It was so bad that I went to the hospital thinking I had a heart attach. I'd like to know if this has been a problem with anyone else.

The problem - it's not appoved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes so my insurance won't pay for it!!!!  Once I use up the sample I got from my doc's office, I'm out of luck:(  ",5,5,5
"I just started taking this a week ago and struggling with the nausea, just bought sea bands to help, has anyone else tried this as well?",3,3,3
"when i first started using victoza, i noticed within the first day that my level came down, and remained under 94 - 130 while I continued the medication, It was  reading 188 - 294 before this time, then I stopped due to the cost of the medication  $88.00 for 2x amonth, 2 pens that was my copay. I couldnt continue it was to expensive with my other medications.  But my glucose level went back up again and I have started taking it again, the price is now $45.00 a month, half the price on my copay, and it is working with half the dose.  I'm happy with the results so far.  But thinking of having some type of weight loss surgery.  Lap Band? ? ? ?  Have to research it some more. ",5,5,5
Only on the meds a week and my numbers are going down - bothe FBS and weight! Thankful that I've had no side effects and that it's so easy to administer.  I take this in the AM and 2000ER Metformin at night.,5,5,5
"I started taking this for weight loss.I felt like I was very ill for the first 10 days ( started at .06-went to 1.8 by day 10 ). It helped me alot, lost the need to eat all the time. Lost the cravings for sugar most of the time. Yes, they're side effectts too this like most drugs out there. I figured I would give myself 30 days and all negative side effects are gone. This is definately worth it, just had to rough it out for the first 2 weeks. By the way, lost  20 lbs !( with diet and gym 5x a week ).",5,4,4
I took 3 injections of this medicine at the .6 dose. It decreased my appetite but I experienced horrible nausea and burning in my throat. I stopped it because I have to work. My doctor is going to be angry,5,1,4
I have been on this shot along with 2000mg of Metformin and 45mg of Actos... The Dr who prescribed this shot told me that it would lower my blood sugar levels and also help me loose weight... It's been a month and a half and I have gained 25 lbs.. Not real happy with this. I'm having problems moving around and also have no energy..My kidneys feel like they are shutting down. I feel 10 times worse now then I did 2 months ago....,4,2,2
nausea all the time. saw no difference in blood sugars,1,1,1
"I have been on Victoza for about 2+ weeks.  I gradually went from .6-1.8.  I had a really tough week or so with the dizziness, headache, heaviness on my chest and TERRIBLE ITCHING!  I'm soooo delighted that others talked about the itching.  The last few days I have noticed I'm having TERRIBLE abdominal and back pain under my ribs.  I had my gallbladder out in Nov 2011, so I think it's pancreatitis.  I see the doctore this afternoon.  I do like what Victoza is doing to my numbers, both AM fasting and during the day, much, much lower.  I have almost no appetite and I have lost 10 lbs. in such a short period of time.  I also take 2000 mg Metformin at dinner.  Not sure what the DR. will say today.  Sometimes you have to wonder if the doctors want the numbers going down at the expense of the patient.  ",5,3,5
"I was extremely allergic to this drug and had to stop taking it after only 2 doses.  I had major problems with itching, shortness of breath, heaviness in my chest, bloating - it was strange because I am not a sick person nor do I have extreme reactions to medications.  The fact that I did to this one - who knows - but I did and that has made me reluctant to take other meds that are injectible.  Try it on for yourself - if it works great! if not watch you symptoms!!",2,1,1
This medication has helped in controlling my blood sugar but it makes  it causes insomnia and makes me hyper. Anyone else with this problelm?,4,3,3
"My blood sugar meter readings now seem to match my low-carb diet.  I find myself having less feelings of hunger through out the day.  I did have some intestinal problems the first week, in the way of bowel movements, but never so severe it kept me from going to school and daily life.",5,5,5
My numbers were high and now in the 112 - 125 range. Glad I am taking this.,5,5,5
Only Rx that could and has brought my high numbers down to controlling area.,5,5,5
This medication is very good.  It is easy to administer to yourself and even if you don't like needles it is better that pricking your finger (less pain).  I have been having indigestion since I have been taking this medicine.  I not sure if the medicine is cause the problem. ,5,5,5
"Developed type two after a drunk driver hit my police car and I gained 35 pounds and began to eat poorly.  Tried all sorts of medications and this one has been the easiest and best so far.  Concerned about the thyroid cancer, but will be vigilant.  Did not like needles, but I do it on the side of my stomach and can not even feel it, unlike the finger testing.  I have also recently lost my gall bladder and have developed a candida yeast infection which has also messed up my stomach.  I was on massive amounts of anti biotics and am not sure if victoza played a role in that or not.  Trying to get my stomach balanced.  Have lost 25 pounds, but that was as much contributed to almost dying from the gall bladder and not being able to eat for two months.  Blood sugars and A1c have been GREAT since starting this.  I also take metformin (1000mg's) twice a day.  Have had to go on and off metformin due to some of the testing and the surgeries I have had, which seems to increase numbers.  Together, victoza and metformin seem to work very, very well even without major improvements in my diet.  Dont give up on the victoza/metformin.  Try tweaking things a bit until you feel better.  Good luck!",5,5,5
Was on glucophage 500BD and Diamicron 30 daily. Difficulty in maintaining sugars. HbA1c started to climb. Started on Victoza and ease at control of sugars. Off the Diamicron and sugars maintained with just 500 of glucophage a day. HbA1c down to 5 after 6 weeks from 7.2.,5,5,5
"I have a fear of needles and this is VERY easy to use and there is no pain. Poking your finger is more painful by far, this is EASY. I love the small needle and it's easy to use, does not require much to inject the medicine. For the first time since I've been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, my sugar levels have dropped to normal levels and I am losing weight finally.",5,5,5

"this medicine made me feel the sickest i have ever felt in my life ! the nausea warning should be changed to "" makes you feel like your guts are being turned inside out "" ! however, i am on day 7 and starting to feel a little better and my fasting sugars have already dropped into the normal range. still feel like i have a boulder in my stomach but am hoping that will eventually go away.",4,2,4
I have been on this med. for two weeks and I am loving it. My sugar has been under control for the first time sense becoming a diabetic in 2000. I have been on every kind of diabetic med. and nothing has helped.,5,4,5

"I have lost over 50 lbs in the last 6 months, my a1c has went from 8.5 to 5.9 over this period. My sugar stays in control which it never has before. I have gastro problems with eggy burbs and then usually throw up and then everything is fine for a while.  The dosage I am taking is .6 + 4 clicks. I have tryed to go to 1.2 but the above gastro gets worse.  If I don't over eat, I don't think I would have a problem but occasionally I do.  I have reduced my other diabetic meds too.  This is great, had to buy some new cloths though. ",5,4,5
Have been using for one week and already seeing average blood sugar drops by 60 mg/dl average.,4,4,4
"I've been on Victoza for a year now and have been very satisfied with my results.  My blood sugars are controlled for the first time in about 10 years!!  I did have quite a bit of nausea at first and definitely had ""eggy"" burps that I've read others have experienced as well.  The nausea got better once I changed my injection to the morning rather than night.  And I've noticed that if I'm disciplined about taking it at the same time each day, then the nausea doesn't seem to come.  I lost 50 lbs within the first 6 months and have stayed fairly steady since then (hoping for more :) ).  ",4,5,5
"I'm a married homemaker and mother to 3 active kids ages 15, 11, and 10. I'm constantly on-the-go, so I don't always have all the time I need for ""me"". This medicine made my life so much simpler.  As of the 29th of this month I will have been taking Victoza for 1 year. In that time, my A1C went from 10.8 to 6.6 and I've lost nearly 60 pounds. AMAZING! I had a little bit of Nausea for the first week or so, but then nothing since. Also, the nausea with Victoza was NOTHING like the nausea I experienced with Byetta. The Byetta was awful and I'd tried just about EVERY other type of medicine out there including Insulin without success.  I'm SO glad my Endocrinologist prescribed Victoza...it has completely changed my life. The once daily injection is a breeze and I've never experienced a ""low"" as my blood sugar is steady all day long. I LOVE this medication and I would highly recommend it to any Type 2 Diabetic. It worked miracles for me...and it will change your life too.  [email protected]",5,5,5
My doctor prescibed this medication because I was at a very high risk of developing diabetes. I have been on this medication for 1 month and I have lost 10 pounds.  It certainly has suppressed my appetite but I am extremely constipated.  ,5,4,5
This has been the best I have ever used I have lost weight my levels have been between 100 and 115 daily my A1C has also dropped sick to my stomach for about a week no problem since,5,5,5
since using this drug my blood sugar has been so mush better.  way down.,5,5,5
"This med has been very effective in lowering my BG levels and A1C numbers. The nausea was initially a problem. I only experienced vomiting once, but that was when I had eaten more than usual. This drug lowers blood sugar and initially supresses the appetite. ",4,5,5
I have been taking this drug for almost 2 years and saw a quickk drop in my daily sugar tests backed up by lowering a1c from 8 down to a steady test at 4.5 to 5. also saw a 12 % weight loss. simple to take after getting past the first shot.,5,5,5
"I've been using Victoza for about 5 weeks. Before that I was taking Byetta twice daily. With victoza I am no longer using insulin (lantus) and feeling WAY BETTER! My A1C test 3 months ago was at 8.6, and as of last week, I have an A1C of 6.5!!!  This medication has really helped to bring my blood glucose back under control and I am feeling so much better now.",5,5,5
I started Victoza 3 weeks ago. I have some nauesa but my morning fasting numbers went from 135 to 95. I'm feeling better every day and I've lost 11 pounds so far. It has helped to control my appetite.,5,5,5
"I have been on Victoza for about 6 weeks. I am currently on 1.2 dose with 1000 mg Metformin 2x per day. I had the nausea for about the 1st wk but that has subsided. I did have some constipation and diarrhea, but I am not sure if that is from the Metformin. I take my injection at night so if there is any nausea I would be asleep.  I would recommend taking at night if you are experiencing nausea.  I have lost over 12 pounds so far and my last A1C was 6.3. I also have been experiancing a decreased appitite.",5,5,5
Been on Victoza for 2 weeks. .6 dose seemed to be working. Doctor upped it to 1.2. After a couple days had horrible side effects. Felt like throwing up all day. Terrible diarrhea. Doctor moved me back to .6. Will see how it goes. Definitely an appetite suppressant.,5,3,4
"Is anybody but me worried about the side effects, most specificially thyroid cancer and or pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer or gall stones? I resisted because of the risk factors but relented. I have only been on it less than 10 days so I still have nausea. I hope that goes away!!!!!!",3,3,3
diarrhea with urgency about 3 hours after administration,5,4,4
"My A1c levels have been consistently under 7 in the 3 years or so, while taking this medication. Admittedly, I have difficulty eating properly in the sense that I usually eat but once a day. I also use Metformin 1000 x 2 a day and my daily blood sugar levels average around 130. It's difficult for me to say whether I have any side effects specifically stemming from Victoza as I have several medical conditions for which I am prescribed other meds. Overall, Victoza has by far been the better of the injectables I've used over the past several years. Levimear = weight gain. Byetta = low blood sugar and stomach problems. On the down side, Victoza is an expensive medication as a BCBS tier 3 $40 per month copay",5,4,4
"Has any one had trouble sleeping on this??? I was on Byetta for 5 years and started feeling really bad recently, so the Dr switched me to Victoza to see if it would help. I feel alot better but my numbers are not where I want them to be, but its only been 3 weeks. I hope this improves with time.",4,4,4
"Can't really say how this Med is doing, it is EXPENSIVE! Even with insurance.",5,4,3
"I started take in Victoza in Feb 2011. I've lost 10 lbs. I'm now at 130 lbs. I'm on the 1.2 dosage. My A1c taken in Aug 2011 was 5.3.  In May 2011 I noticed my hair was thinning. Hair loss is not one of the side effects. However, this drug does slow down the digestive system which can interfere vitamin and mineral abortion. I started taking a daily vitamin/mineral supplement.  I also started take additional zinc (with copper include). My hair is growing back. I have little short hairs growing back.  Hair loss also can happen when a person looses weith too quickly.",4,4,5
"After 6 months on Victoza, my morning sugar are down about 17%.  My P.M. sugars are well under 105.  Not like other users, I have not lost any significant weight. Started out with a bit of nausea, but it is all gone now.  I would highly recommend Victoza.",5,4,5
Nausa upset stomach but good weight loss still using lost 86 lbs,5,5,5
"I have been on Victoza for five weeks, lost 15 pounds, and have morning blood sugars that have dropped in half, from 190 down to 95.  Only using 0.6 per day, and the appetite suppresant alone would be worth it.  I guess I'm one of the fortunate ones who have no side affects, outside of a slight nausea the first day.  So far, so good.",4,5,5
"Have had great success with victoza. After initial nausea and weight loss, things settled down. I am still losing weight though not as fast. Diabetes under control",5,5,5
"Have been on Victoza for about 3 months. It took a few weeks to get to 1.8 due to nausea. My blood sugars have lowered drastically and am very happy with drug.  One of lucky ones whose insurance covers.  The only real side effect is ""rotten egg"" burps which are embarassing in public because of smell.  Any suggestions?",5,5,5
"Was prescribed Victoza for pre-diabetes. Has the usual side effects of nausea, headaches, which subsided after a few weeks.  Was not sure about how this med. affected my BG levels because docter did not advise me to do so and I was not familiar with diabetic practices.  I lost about 10 lbs.  I developed new side effects, however, after a few months of use.  I had increased pulse rate, severe fatigue, greatly increased hot flashes, and a surge in my apetite.  So I took myself off of this med. and will advise doctor at next appt.  I have since gained about 5 lbs back.  One note to consider; I am on a lot of other meds for fibromyalgia and depression which may have had a bad interaction with Victoza. ",3,1,3
The first two weeks were difficult with the nausea and being tired all the time.  I’ve lost about 7 lbs in two weeks.  My appetite is gone and I eat small normal size meals.  My morning blood sugars went from 200 to 90 within days.  I fell better that I have in years.  I did use the discount prescription card at Walgreens and they charged mw $35.00 when the program is $25.00????  ,4,5,5

I do watch my diet and am more able to exercise since I am not so big.  Initially I had nausea and headache on the medicine.  However my endocrinologist advised me to go back on my dose and increase my dose more gradually and my nausea subsided.  I do have an occasional headache.  I think it is an incredible medication if immense help to me!",5,5,5
"It does make you nauseated at first, in fact it really made me sick, but after about a week and a half I was feeling okay. It is helping my blood sugar it lowered my A1C by .9 the first 2 mths.",5,4,4

I have been vomiting often. It's quite frustrating.,5,3,3

"Diagnosed with DM 2 in mid 2010. Dr prescribed this medication and I did worry about an injection everyday.  My blood sugars dropped from 400+ at time of diagnosis to 90-110 fasting and after meals.   VERY expensive because the company still has the patent on the medication.  Skip a few months and my insurance changed- had to start using Byetta.  The Byetta caused all sorts of side effects and I stopped taking it until I could appeal my insurance co to cover the Victoza again.  Looking forward to lower blood sugars and decreased appetite again.   Very good medication in my opinion, just sad it is so cost prohibitive to people without insurance or poor coverage plans.",5,5,5

I started taking VICTOZA about 3 months ago. First weak I experienced nausea and constipation but and during the first month I lost 8 lb. The next month I lost another 6 lb and now so far I lost 20 lb. I hope this continues since the blood sugar is normal and I am feeling not hungry for longer periods of time.,3,4,4
"I've been on Victoza for over a year.   My blood sugar was nearly perfect and I lost 40 lbs in 4 months.  Then.....  All of the appetite suppression went away, and of course my weight started going up and up.   I have now gained back the 40 pounds plus 10 more!   I'm very disappointed.   My doctor doesn't have an explanation.  I did notice that one time when I accidently double dosed myself (several hours apart) that the appetite control came back, at least for a few hours.  I just don't see a lot of difference between taking two 1000mg of Glumetza, and taking the Glumetza plus the Victoza.  This is all based on my personal experience.   I think in August I'm going to go back on Byetta for a while. ",3,2,3
"I initially started taking Victoza about two months ago.  I would inject it every morning at 6:00 A.M. ant take my hypertension meds (by mouth with food) at the same time.  As I titrated the dose up to 1.8mg.'s my blood pressure began going up.  By time I reached the 1.8 mg. dose my BP had reached a really dangerous level (174/108 so I stopped taking it and my BP dropped back to it's normal(118/76) or reasonably there about.  Needless to say, my physician wasn't happy that I had discontinued the Victoza with out consulting him.  He went as far as to say ""the Victoza wouldn't do that""(time for a new Doc.) referring to the elevated BP.  Long story short..the doc. changed my BP meds and placed me back on the Victoza...Same problem with the BP again.  Not wanting to stop the Victoza because it was really controlling my blood sugar readings and food cravings, I did some more research decided to try taking the Victoza 3 hours after my BP meds....Bingo..BP has stayed within my normal range and the Victoza is working well.  My guess is that the Victoza works so well at slowing stomach emptying that the my BP meds were probably only trickling into my system if they were being absorbed at all.  Only other problem was some constipation...that seems to have passed (sorry for the bad pun).",3,3,4
"I have been taking this drug for six days. Nausea, diahrrea, no actual vomiting but have been crying for two days! I also take Prozac. Anyone out there on both of these meds? ",4,2,2

Sadly, the side effect of weight loss hasn't happened to me, either.  I talked to the doctor, wanting to go back to the fairly effective combo I was on before, but she just said to go up to 1.8.  That was 3 days ago and my fasting blood sugar is still over 200 every morning.",4,1,1

"I've been taking two diffeent types of insulin (fast acting and a 24 hr. type that levels me out for a 24 hour period) for at least 8-10 years.  I recently found that not only had I gained weight but my insulin use increased substantially (daily fast acting up to 70 units; evening insulin up at 62 units).  I began using Victoza about 1 month ago and the results have been startling.  There was a 2 1/2 day period that other than the Victoza shot, I took NO insulin whatsoever!  While using Victoza I soon learned that any corrective fast acting insulin must be reduced dramatically or there are severe ""going low"" consequences.  No problem now with adjustments I've made (I take no more than 7 units of fast acting insulin for a full  day and I reduced my evening type dose to 42 units.)  Now when I awake in the morning, my blood sugars are between 80-133 and are relatively normal throughout the day.  A huge change for me.  I have also lost 15 lbs. and have a suppressed appetite (something that goes along with the Victoza use).  The side effect for me is nausea.  This side effect began on day 1 and continued for almost 20 hours/day for a month.  Now my nausea has been significantly reduced but my appetite remains suppressed.  This is a miracle drug!  My doctor says this drug contains a certain hormone (nomally produced by the body) that directs the pancreas to produce more insulin (the stated purpose of Victoza). Apparently, I have not been making this hormone for some time.  Now, 1 Victoza shot of 1.2 units/day is all it takes and I'm close to normal. I hope this all continues.",5,5,5

"Tried Byetta - dropped by BS too much.  Started Victoza, within first 2 weeks stopped 2 other medications for diabetes.  Have had very few side effects.  Additionally have lost 30 lbs in 6 months because I feel full longer and I am not always craving food because of variance in BS.  I am glad this is working for me.",5,5,5
"I had been taking Byetta before starting Victoza so my side effects were minimal.  It has been working great for me, controlling my blood sugar and also my appetite.  My A1C's have been between 5.8 and 6.3.  I have had just a few occasions where my sugars dropped low.  So far this drug has worked great for me.",5,5,5

Back pain, abdominal pain, horrible diarrhea, reflux and ""rotten egg"" burps - feeling very sick for two days now.  It has definitely helped my numbers... actually 89 the other day! This is down from my norm of over 200!  The shots themselves are relatively painless, but the side effects at the higher dosage are pretty miserable.  I hope they will subside soon.",1,2,4
Been on this medication for about 4 months and it is fabulous. Blood sugars were normal within days at 1.2 dosage. Lost about 22 pounds though that has slowed down. My only issues are the cost which I currently have a 1 yr. discount card from Victoza for $25/mo. and the belching/constipation. Just uncomfortable but not horrible. I went off oral meds because of gastro issues (allergic to sulfa) and had been on Byetta (didn't work) and Symlin (unpredictable nausea) as well as lantus and novloog. Am now off novolog entirely and dosage on lantus is cut by about 1/3. ,5,5,5
"when i first started it,i lost weight.however the longer i was taking it i regained the weight.now i am maintaining the weight rather than gaining. i have been experiencing stomach and back pain which i thought was irritable bowel syndrome.now i have read the side effects i am not so sure about this. ",4,3,3
Makes me sick on my stomach,3,3,4
"I was on Byetta before but my body got used to it so I went on Victoz.  It worked great and my A1c dropped from 9.6 to 7.6 in 3 - 4 months.  However, now that I have Kaiser for insurance, they don't approve of this drug and are forcing me to take insulin.  The insulin isn't working and I'm furious that they won't put me back on Victoza unless I want to pay the full price... $700+ for 3 wks of medicine.  What can I do to get back on Victoza??? I'm despirate and my blood sugars keep running in the 320 + range.  Anyone have suggestions?  Email me at [email protected]",5,5,5
"I have been taking victoza for 2 months, along with metformin and Lantus. It took about a month to really ""kick in"" but when it did, I brought my BS down to the low 100's and I lost 20 lbs so far. I was able to lower my Lantus from 55 iu down to 30 iu. I have not experienced any adverse side effects!",5,5,4
I have had no side effects! It has lowered my blood sugars. I am eating less which good for me because I need to lose weight.,5,5,5
"over the years have used Byetta (no good for me) Levemir and Novolog (caused severe bloating) various Oral meds incl. metformin which disagrees with me, and finally now on Victoza. Been using Victoza for 4 months now also using amaryl 4mg per day and lost 34lbs, no more swelling or bloating. Started on .6 and went to 1.2 within 2 weeks and now on 1.8. Great appetite suppressor. currently trying Metformin again as well to help lower BG numbers, however only able to handle 125mg 2x per day without side affects. Only problem now is constant indigestion and burping, very little acid. I think it is the Metformin and higher 1.8 dose combined, so will hang in there and see how  the next 2 months go, adding an anti indigestion med to the mix. overall very happy with experience and on the way to losing another 15lbs this three months... AND lowering BG#... we'll see.",5,4,4
I've had hypoglycemia since my 30's..now in my 60's I vasillate between type 2 and hypo with sugars going high and/or dropping low.  This drug has helped me to balance out these highs and lows... I have been using it for 6 months.  lost 5 lbs at the beginning but no symptoms or problems with the drug... just a balanced sugar level.. ,5,5,5
"I have lost 11 pounds in just 9 days on this drug.  That's a plus but the benefit of having no appetite makes me have to force myself to eat. The nausea, at least for me, is minimal if at all.  I started out at 0.6 for 1 week and have been on the 1.2 for 3 days now.  I think it is a great drug that minimizes stomach upset.  Was on Metformin and had constant stomach/bowel issues.   The warning about the pancreatitis for those with high tryglicerides kind of spooked me but I talked with my doctor and he said it was a minimal risk.  I read the clinical trials as well.  I would recommend this to anyone who is pre-diabetic or type 2.",5,4,5
I have been on so many different medications and this is the first one that has truly worked for me.  I am so happy to finally have my diabetes under control.,5,5,5
lower my blood sugar level by 100 points ,5,4,4
"Have been on Victoza since 9/25/10. At the 1.8 dosage for about 3 mos. Doing great. A1C was 6.2. Dr very pleased. Have lost 34 lbs since starting. Still helps w/appetite control, but not like at first. Even so, am definitely making better decisions on my own.",5,5,5
"Was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2004, and while Metformin worked at first, it gradually became less effective.  Dr. added Glucotrol, and upped the Metformin dose, and I did my best with diet and exercise, but my numbers just went up and up.  Finally went to see an endocrinologist who put me on Victoza.  Have had no noticeable side effects, and my fasting blood glucose went from 276 to 92 in a month.  A1c is down 1.5 points in that same time period.  My BG numbers are now always well within the normal range and I'm losing weight.  Don't love the injections, but it's not hard or painful, and the result is totally worth it!",4,5,5
"I've been on BP meds, chol. meds for years, always been heavy. Had bariatric surgery 11 years ago and gained all 110 lbs back +. All joints ached. Miserable. Diagnosed w/ type II diabetes 2 years ago but did nothing about it until 3 months ago (other than Metformin). Started Victoza and it is like a lifeline for me! Minor nausea for first week but that's all. All readings have come way down, no more pain, no more swelling in legs/feet. But best news is 45 lb. weight loss. Increased from lowest to highest setting in 1 week. Not hungry, no more ""grazing"" which is my downfall normally, happy and hopeful for first time in LONG time. Only trouble is I can't afford the drug as my insurance won't cover it. Dr. has stopped giving me samples. I'm out of Victoza and now devastated. Talk about ""dangling the carrot!"" Make slightly too much for medical aid. Give me something that finally works then take it away due to outrageous costs. Victoza drug rep tried to help but my insurance wouldn't budge on it. Help!",5,5,5
"I am a type 2 diabetic and I was on Metformin. I was having some complications with it so I stopped taking it. Well, I found a new doctor and she placed me on this medicine. It has been wonderfull! I dont eat as much, I feel full faster, and my BS level is staying down. I am not a fan of shots, but this is so easy that I can do it myself. I am starting to have some trouble with my feet hurting though. Does anyone else have this problem?",5,5,5
"I have been taking Victoza for 6 months.  At first I had headaches, was nausas, heart burn,constipation...it took about 2 months of backing down and slowly increasing again on the dosage and taking it in the evening.... to level out. I also had flu like symptoms and was so tired all the time. I lost 13 lbs. initially in 2 weeks and put 3lbs. back on. My blood sugar levels are better than they have been in years. I am so happy with Victoza, it was worth the rough time I went thru at first. Now I have started weight Watchers to take more lbs. off. My enery level is up and I am working out or walking every day. LIFE IS GOOD! Thank you Victoza!!",2,4,5
"I have just started taking the 1.2mg injection. Three hour later, before lunch my BS reading was 265. Does anyone know how long it takes for Victoza to start lowering BS levels?",5,1,2
"I have been on Victoza for 2 weeks and I love it. My BS is actually normal now. I am still on oral meds and insulin. I have had some ill effects, like constipation, gas, bloating, nausea and headache but they seem to have disappeared now. I am now on the 1.8mg dose. I have lost a few pounds. My appetite has decreased which helps with weight and sugar control. I am keeping an eye out for serious complication(which can happen with ANY drug). I am very satisfied with Victoza",5,5,5
I like the med. but have a problem with nausea and vomitting.,5,5,5
I take 1.2 micrograms of Victoza along with 500mg metformin bid. This drug is pretty much amazing. I've been on it for about two weeks and my BG levels are way down. Was averaging about 250 fasting and am now down to low 100s fasting. I've also lost about 6lbs already. The needle is so small that you barely feel it. I prefer this drug to Byetta. I am so grateful for this medication.,4,5,5
it took my blood sugar from 190 to 75,5,5,5
Really brought my readings into normal range.  Had a severe breathing reaction after increase to 10mg.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  Went to the emerg. room.  told to stop taking victosa.  ,5,1,5
This shot has worked for me along with Advandia (I know the reports on this and I am not having any problems been on Advandia for years) ~ It's easy to take with no pain or side effects!!,5,5,5
drug interactions WITH pain medicines caused bad rashes,3,2,3
Have been on Victoza for 2 1/2 months with no side effects. I have lost so far 35lbs. but now at a standstill. So far my numbers are good. Am very pleased with the drug I take 1.8 each day,5,5,5
"I have been on this medication for 6 months without experiencing any serious side effects. Initially, I had some nausea, but once I regulated the dose, it's been fine. I take it along with one tablespoon of flaxseed oil which has significantly dropped my levels and my AC1. If you want to take a natural alternative along with med, get your doc's permission first. I just wish the med was less costly, but so far worth it.",5,5,5
"Started on Victoza a little over a week ago.  First day, I took my Vicodin for my joint pain and was sick as a dog.  Never been so sick in all my life.  Throwing up on average every 2 minutes for 2 1/2 hours straight.  Then, was fine till a week later when I took my Vicodin again.  Also sick.  I blamed it on the Victoza, but I think it's the combo.  My numbers are incredible.  Went from morning fasting of around 250 to about 140 on the .06 dose.  Am still taking metformin and glymiperide.  Am going to tritrate up to the 1.2 gently over the next week, but may have to cut the glimperide down.  Weight loss: 5 lbs. but could be due to vomiting and diarrhea.  Love this drug though.  ",5,5,5
"Have been on Victoza for two months. Started on 0.6 and moved up to 1.2 two weeks later. Initial nausea has subsided. My sugar levels are way down, I am losing weight and have stopped my nightly insulin injections. Still take 2000 mg of metformin daily. After all the other drugs I have been on, this is the only one that has worked and I am quite happy with it.",5,5,5
"I've been taking Victoza for just over a week.  No luck with oral medications.  Instant positive results with Victoza.  Initially, I had nausea, but that improved on a daily basis.  I'm not constantly hungry, so I can see weight loss in my future.  I will be increasing the dose to 1.2 mg within the next week, and remain optimistic that I can deal with any side effects that might accompany the increased dose.  Victoza has been an eye opener for me.  2 or 3 days of use showed me that being more and more restrictive in my diet was not going to help my oral meds lower my blood sugar.  I am just so happy with the results I've experienced so far with Victoza.  I feel like the hands of time have been turned back for my health!!!!",5,5,5
"Lost weight the first 2 months, am now at a plateau it seems. No side effects.",5,5,5
"In one month of taking Victoza, I have had four episodes of severe vomiting, diahhrea, severe stomach pains and indigestion.  I now have a serious infection of the pancreas and will need treatment. I think this drug is the worst!  It should not be on the market!!!  These are serious side effects!!!",3,1,1
very rugged side effects of the stomach and intestinal tract,5,1,5
Dropped my glucose to half and my insulin is cut way back. I have some stomach upset but not too bad. Almost gave up hope. great stuff!!!,5,5,5
I've been on victoza for about a month_sugars way down with no bad side effects-UNTIL NOW-I am having an allergic reaction at injection site.  Any suggestions? Topical creams? Tips?,5,4,5
i did not get hungery,4,4,4
When I first took it I was very sick at my stomach and felt horrible.  As I increased the dosage the nausea got better.  I am so glad that I waited it out and kept taking it.,3,5,4
I have been on Victoza for a week and am very pleased with the results so far.  I am up to the 1.2 dosage and have lost a few pounds plus it has cut my appetite tremendously.  My sugars were in the mid 300's before starting the drug and in the last 24 hours they are in the upper 100's.  I have had a little bit of nausea but taking the drug at night seems to help.  The worst side effect I have had is burping...alot.  No acid reflux (I'm on Nexium for that) but quite a bit of burping.  Wondering if anyone else has had this problem?,5,5,4
this treatment has work well for me,4,4,4
LOVE THIS DRUG...IVE LOST 25LBS IN 4 MONTHS AND BS WAY DOWN!!!,5,5,5
"I've only been on the drug for six days on the lowest dosage of .6.  I've lost 5 lbs. although I do experience hunger before meals. No major side effects except mild reflux.  Worked amazingly first 3 days, with blood sugars decreasing by about 100 points.  However, since the fourth day, numbers have been steadily rising.  Hoping the 1.2 does will stop the rise.  Has this happened to anyone else where the first few days were great but then the blood sugars began to rise?",5,5,3
I tried Byetta and experienced intense nausea and couldn't tolerate it. My MD switched me to Victoza and I have lost 20 lbs in 4 months. I still experience mild nausea and acid reflux but my A1C is better and my sugars are better controlled.,5,5,5
I just started using this drug. My doctor is positively optomistic about the coming results for me. Therefore the scores I gave above should come up in the next few months of use.,4,2,2
"PLEAS IF YOU ARE READING THIS, STOP TAKING THIS DRUG, MY MOTHER WAS TAKING IT ,AND SHE ALMOST DIED BECAUSE OF IT. SHE IS IN HOSPITAL AND IS IN SEVERE PAIN, SUFFERING FROM PANCREATITUS. THIS DRUG SHOULD BE BANNED..................",2,1,1
"I started taking Victoza on Nov 23rd. It's been six weeks and I lost 10lbs. I am so happy with the weight lost. I started out on lowest dose, I am on max dose now. I did have nausea mostly at night and some acid reflux. It seems to be getting alot better. My glucose readings are way down. The lowest it's been in 13 years.I can't wait to go back to dr at the end of month to see what my A1C is now. Last one was 7.3.... I take Janumet 50/1000mg 2xday. Amaryl 4mg-- 1and half tab daily.Victoza 1.8mg in morning. It definitely decreased my appetite, I no longer crave sweets like I used to, which is amazing in itself.....This is a wonder drug for me, I just hope I dont end up with the thyroid cancer. My pharmacist said it is safe, that the benefits outweigh the risk and that everything has potential for serious side effects. I dont know if losing the weight has anything to do with this but I noticed my blood pressure has been really low so I decreased my benicar to see if that's what I needed... I hopefully will loose some more weight at least 20lbs and I would be so happy...... I will post my blood results when I get them next.",5,5,5
"First week on new med, taking with glucophage 1000mg bid, love this med! Was on Byetta but Victoza is better.  Blood sugars are excellent, appetite suppressed. Hoping for great results nest week when I up my dose.",5,5,5
"I have been on Victoza for about 6 months with fantastic results.  I did experience nausea with initial dosing, however, Dr. prescribed Phenergan to take along with the shot until the nausea subsided.  The Dr. recommended taking the shot just before bedtime along with the anti-nausea meds.  Also, do not give the initial dosages in your stomach area, this will increase the nausea effects.  My A1c went from 7 to 5.1.  I have lost about 45 lbs. and will probably no longer have to take Metformin.  I was very hesitant about taking Victoza, but glad I stuck it out with the nausea and hope to continue to lose weight.  ",5,5,5
63 yr. old woman.  On a little over week @ 6.1.  Sometimes sligh nausea but huge appetite loss - a size down in 1 week!  Feel horrible like a zombie.  No joy.  Depression and tired beyond normal.  Not liking how this feels at all but the weight loss is fab and sugars are way down!  I'll give it until I do next dosage 1.2 for 2 weeks and going to dr. to talk about it.,5,2,5
Have been on Victoza for 4 months. HgA1C was 9 and dropped to 6. No side effects. No wt loss either but getting BS close to normal is great.,5,5,5
"Have been on Victoza for about 8 weeks now.  Started on .6 for 1 week and bumped dose up to 1.2 one week then up to 1.8 1 week.  Have had nausea from the start and was so bad at highest dose I dropped back to 1.2 1 week with no relief.  Spoke with Dr and she told me to drop to .6 which I have been on for 5 weeks.  Still having nausea despite watching dietary intake, drinking fluids, etc.  Fasting BS have been between 85-110 and after meals highest was 115.  However I can't stand the nausea and have experienced dizzyiness, weakness and constant leg and foot aches and pains (not sure what this is all about as I have done nothing to hurt my legs/feet).  Also been having itching scalp, legs , arms and body but thought it was just dry skin.  Didn't know it was a side effect until today.  I've tried giving injections with meals, without meals and at bedtime.  I wake up nauseated and experience nausea throughout the day even on lowest dose.  I don't think this drug is for me. I see my Dr monday the 20th and going to get her to stop the drug.  I am sick of being sick. ",4,2,3
well i really havent taken this drug very long only 1 week but it is esy to use and my sugar seems to be doing better,5,5,4
"Started Victoza six + months ago. Using  Actos pills, Lantus at 45 units daily and Humalog 10 – 15 units 3X daily. A1C was 6.5 and gaining one pound per month.  Initial goal was to lose weight. First attempt 0.6 for one week then 1.2. Stopped because of the vomiting and hiccups.  Second attempt 0.6 for one month then 1.2. At 1.2 suffered from heartburn, ED and hiccups. Third attempt 0.6 until sugar levels begin to rise (2 Months) then went to 1.2 for two weeks. At full dose for just over a week now. No longer taking Lantus or Humalog with morning readings between 100 and 106. Spikes are below 180 two hours after meals and 100 – 106 before meals.  Side effects are hiccups after meals and random hiccups between meals, constipation and ED. ED medications ineffective so far.  Giving it another month to see if the ED goes away. The key was staying at a lower dose until blood sugars rose to the point of increasing insulin. Eating several small meals daily and drinking lots of water with mild exercise is a plus. ",5,4,5
great a1c is very much controled.  55 pounds lost using this drug,5,5,5
A big improvement over Byetta in ease of use.  Started at 0.6 for first week and then directly to 1.2 dosage without any problems. Weight loss has been a plus.,5,4,4
"easy,slightly nausea, appetite decreased and loss weight which I wanted.",5,5,5
"I'm 56 yr old female.  Changed from Janumet to Januvia about 3 months ago.  Absolutely no side effects except went from constant metformin diarrhea to a little constipation, but that left when I bumped up the fiber.  No appetite unless I have physical hunger, which is good, and I'm down around 5 lbs.  Not as good BG control as I would like, but I spent about 5 of those weeks with a tooth infection and one on cortisone, which wreaked havoc with the BG.  I'm scared of the thyroid cancer possibility--to the one who's developed the cancer, what were the symptoms?  I feel for you....",5,5,4
"Easier than Byetta. One injection a day and not having to time it around a meal makes it much more appropriate for my lifestyle. So far I've had very little nausea. My appetite is significantly decreased, but not in an unpleasant way.",4,5,5
"I've been on Victoza for about a month now as the sole med to treat my Type 2 diabetes. Started off at 0.6 for 1 week... then increased by two CLICKs each day for 5 days until I reached the goal of 1.2mg. I found that the slow titration upward decreased the side effects. I must say I've had some nausea the first week... but haven't vomited until today. Vomited several times this morning... not sure why now?? Injections in my stomach and thigh often times causes a quarter size bruise. I don't like that at all. I have found a hip injection to work the best... no pain or bruising. I hope that site is ok. It seems to be working pretty well. BSs are down a good bit but my fasting bs is higher than I would like... about 115 each morning. I hope my A1C gets back below 7 and I don't have to increase my dose up to 1.8. Constipation is my biggest side effect. I have never had that issue before. I'm taking 3 Docusate Sod 100mg per day. Its better but still an issue. So far, I like the Victoza over Metformin as the Metformin made me violently sick with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. So overall I'm pleased... will know more later",4,4,4
To soon to tell only one month .,5,5,4
"Have been on Victoza since Sept 25, started 6 days at .6, then upped to 1.2.  A bit of nausea at first, long gone.  Lots of constipation, taking fiber.  It has drastically reduced my readings back to normal.  Between 5 and 6.5 in the morning and absolutely no highs anymore.  I am on an insulin pump and have had to reduce my total amount of insulin from approx 85u a day to 50u or so.  I have lost 14lbs and my appetite is greatly reduced.   My endocrinologist said we will wait another month and then increase to 1.8, it should help even more for the weigh lost. This drug is unbelievable, I only wish I had found it before. I cannot take Metformin as it makes me seriously sick. ",5,5,5
haven't tried it,1,1,1
Have had three episodes of vomiting during the past month.  I thought I had food poisoning the first time but soon realized what was causing it.  I am no longer taking Victoza.  Stomach feels a lot better.  It did lower my sugar readings but I could not tolerate the side effects.,3,1,1
"Have been on Victoza for about 2 weeks. Endless nausea, some vomiting and diarreah all the first week. Probably lost weight because I feel like Im going to be sick all the time. Blood sugars just as high as always, I feel like my Zoloft is no longer effective and am basically miserable on this. Will give it another week or two but if no improvements, forget it!",3,1,2
"After 7 weeks, I have lost 10 pounds and my morning BSL is down from around 200 to the 130s. Not as low as I would like but something is better than nothing. I also take Metformin 1000 twice a day and Glipizide 2x daily as well. I have found that if I have a piece of toast or something else small on my stomach when I first take the injection, there is no nausea and vomiting. I have definately lowered my intake of food which is the major goal, and my numbers lower as well. I have not had any of the other side effects mentioned here, so I count myself lucky. Hope this helps!!!",5,5,4
"I have been on this now for about 2 weeks, started at the lower dosage for the first 4 days with no nausea or vomiting.  Increased it after 4 days and on the 6th day I had a violent episode of vomiting and severe nausea however since then everything is good.  I have lost about 5 pds so I'm loving the appetite suppresant, levels are lower and I hoping they get better.  NO other side effects and I'm loving it!!!!!",5,5,4
"I have been using for 6 months or more, recently up dosage to 1.8mm.  I have had sinus stuffiness, doesn't go away.  Nausea was short lived no problems, does help some with appetite, but not tremendously.  So much easier to remember one shot a day, I take in the morning or early afternoon.  I do have constipation issues since starting, and severe dry skin since upping my dosage of this medication.  My morning blood sugars are definitely better, nothing else had helped morning sugar readings.  Overall, this medication has been a good thing for me.  ",4,3,4
"this drug has work great,about a week into taking I started getting a bad egg taste in my mouth,I stop taking the drug for one day and now i have been taking for the last two weeks and i don't have no more bad egg taste in my mouth.",3,4,4
"Started Victoza 9/25 & have lost 14 lbs. Feeling fabulous! Feelings of light to moderate nausea have gone away, but appetite still supressed most of the time. Inject at night before going to bed. Dr is really please, as am I! Blood sugars within normal range first time in a long, long time!",5,5,5

"I have been taking Victoza for 10 days now. I lost 6 lbs, and have reduced my insulin intake by 20 units a day. Little bit of almost nausea, no appetite, have to force myself to eat, except in the morning. So far, I am in love with this drug, hope it continues to help me reduce my insulin and lose weight.",5,5,5
"5th day on this and have had great results with my blood pressure.  Sugars are fine. Has taken all of the water off of my legs, which use to be so bad.  I can touch my shin bones now.  However I don't like the nausea but am hoping that it will subside.  I am taking the beginning dose of .6. Having slight headache but is manageable. Loss of appetite is great, but no one likes to eat to much when they are nauseated. First time with injections and is incredibly easy and painless with no bruising.  Am hoping that the weight starts to shed. I am so glad that my copay is only $20.  ",5,4,5
"Have been on Victoza over 3 mos. now.  I have nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarhea.  I thought that by changing the time I take my Victoza, 1.2, to the afternoon and my other dia., blood pressure, synthroid, etc. meds in the morning that the nausea might stop.  It hasn't.  I cannot stand the morning nausea feeling anymore. occasionally this is accompanied by vomiting/dry heaves of thick clear foamy liquid.  Victoza has decreased my appetite. I do not know how much if any weight loss yet.  It has lowered by morning sugars to the 90's.  I would like to continue to take it for its appetite depressant and lower blood sugars but I cannot stand the nausea ruining days out of my life.  I have changed the timing of the medication, which seemed to help for a while, but I am still getting the nausea.  I do crave sweets more though.  I would only hope that there is a solution to my problem because I do want to continue this medication for its sugar lowering and weight loss effects but will not be able to do so with this nausea.  I have also recently had an allergic reaction requiring the immediate use of benedryl.  Don't know for sure if reaction was to the VICTOZA.  I am going to contact my dr. to stop this med. unless there is some other way to get around the nausea.  ",4,3,5

Been using Victoza for several months now. Very good results. Unfortunatley I have been recently diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer. My doctor said there may be a link to Victoza usage. Not good.,4,2,5
"This has been a good experience for me.  I've used Victoza 2 months and lost over 15lbs, immediately.  I started at .6 then moved up to 1.2 on the Victoza Pen.  Walmart Pharmacy has a very good prescription program to help with the cost of the needles and Pen.  My readings are between 85 and 90 before and after eating. Was nauseated but never threw up.",4,4,4
"I have only been on this medicine for 3 days, but everything seems good so far.  I was leary about giving myself a shot, but Victoza is very easy to use and you can hardly feel the needle.  For those concerned about the cost, my Doctor said that there are certain pharmacies that have a pilot program with Victoza where your co-pay is covered for a year. I have noticed that I feel full much fast than before and am not hungry as much as before.  I have had acid reflux and a minor headache but nothing unmanageable.  ",5,4,4
"I am a morbidly obese patient, that has PCOS, insulin resistance, and I am not a diabetic.  However, the insulin resistance part of the PCOS is making it nearly impossible to loose weight, no matter how little I eat.  I am on Victoza for 3 full weeks now, along with a prescription of Metformin, and I have lost about 11 pounds the first 3 weeks.  I have not had ANY nausea or gas issues that people complain about, and I am at max dose 1.8 once a day.  My appetite is drastically less, my cravings are completely reduced, and it takes less food to feel full with.  So far, I could not be happier with this new medication.",5,5,5
"I been taking Victoza since the end of July 2010.  This is a miracle drug for me.  Typically my blood sugars have average 85 to 100 since taking it, and I've lost about 10 lbs so far.  The appetite has definitely change; I have to remember to eat and no longer crave sweets/carbs.  In the early weeks, the vomiting was hard to deal with, but that has eased some what.  I take it (1.2mg Victoza) along side 1000mg of Glucaphage daily, but have to ensure at least 4 hours between the Victoza and a Glucaphage dose or the vomiting returns. All in all, I'm very happy with this medication.  Yeah for 'V'...",5,5,5
I began using Victoza 4 months ago..I have experienced so side effects and my HA1C has gone down significantly (from 7.0 to 6.1). What I like best is the fact that you only use one shot a day so it is much easier to use.,5,5,5
"Overall goal is weight loss and reduce or eliminate insulin thru weight loss, exercise and diet.  Started this drug for third time with Actos. First time with Humalog (on a sliding scale before meals) and Lantus at bedtime, (dose cut in half as needed until zero is needed) at 1.2 does experienced violent hiccups and vomiting along with constipation. Lost 10 pounds and sugars were never over 120. Root cause was Meals to large and not drinking enough water. Second attempt experienced ED at 1.8. Third attempt, first week, 0.6; sugars no higher than 125, have not taken any Lantus or Humalog. Lost 4 pounds.  mild heart burn and occasional hiccups.  Will move up click by click until ED occurs then back off until ED goes away. Third time Pros; weigh loss, not hungry and lower sugars. Cons; not thirsty, can’t judge sugar low levels by feel, not thirsty at all, very small and more frequent meals or violent hiccups/nausea will result, generally feel different, mild heart burn, occasional hiccups when I consume near the food limit. Happy with drug if I can lose weigh without the major side effects.",5,4,4
"I have been on Victoza for 4 weeks now and my numbers haven't been above 116.  Sore at the injection site(leg), but overal tollerable.  Weight loss total so far is 8 lbs.  I don't feel as tired and I have to force myself to eat.  I haven't finished a complete meal, always leaving food on my plate. I wish I started this medicine a long time ago!!",4,4,5
"After 3 months - 34 lb weight loss, blood sugars have dropped about 30 points, A1C went from 6.1 to 5.9. Only side effect so far is manageable constipation. Hope this all keeps up (except the constipation). So far am very happy with Victoza - dose 1.2 ",3,5,5
I'm very pleased with the results.  I take Victoza and Metformin (2 times a day).  My numbers are better than the ever were with Byetta. I've been taking it for 3 weeks with no side effects so far.,4,4,4
"been on about 3 weeks, losing weight OK, indegistion more often, sugar levels seem higher without glucophage but going to give it a few more weeks, better than beyetta.",5,5,3
I am a 35 year old female and have been taking Victoza since August 22. I have lost 10 lbs so far. I am very tired but I feel better now than I did before the medication. I have no other side effects except bruising at the injection sites which is no big deal. Will continue to monitor progress.,4,5,5
Three weeks into starting Victoza and I'm still sick.  I haven't gotten to the full dosage yet.  I have to make myself eat.  I don't know how long I'll continue.  Lost 8 lbs.so far.,2,2,3
digestive problams,4,3,5
"I started Victoza around March 2010. I have lost around 10 pds, my blood sugars are always great now. I am still taking glucophage also.  This drug has been a miracle for me. I would recommend it. I have had no bad side effects that I read from others. Doc says A1C is great!",5,5,5
"So far so good. Have been on Victoza since March 2010. No significant weight loss. Some bruising at the injection site. I have experienced a slight nausea that I would attribute to Victoza. I inject in the abdomen, it's not fun. Drug needs to be oral.",3,4,4
"Victoza simply put my bowels in an uproar and I was tired all the time, after 6 weeks.  I am off of it now and feel better and bowels are in check.  But I like the no craving sweets and loss of weight, slowly.",5,1,5
"Replaced insulin with  Victoza, and in three weeks have ramped up from 0.6 to 1.8 mg/day.  Blood sugar is well controlled, usually between 90 and 110 in the morning, and during the day staying within 20 points of the morning reading--much better than with the once-a-day insulin.  Also in those three weeks I've lost 8 pounds.  Minor nausea (though no vomiting) has kept my appetite down.  Have been experimenting with much smaller meals, which has usually helped.  I am very tired, though--is this a side effect of the drug or the disease?  Very satisfied with the drug.  ",5,5,5
Extreme nausea and tiredness at the highest dose of 1.6.  Dropped back to 1.2 and symptoms much less.  Now an injection site reaction is happening.,3,3,4
"I been on it for 1 week., blood sugars are down.,blood sugars run around 200, this week 150 and today 114., But I can't stand the headaches",5,2,3
"Took Victoza over 4 months. Told my Dr. about the vomiting; she wanted me to stay on it. So I started over with using the lower, middle and higher doses on a weekly basis.  Still I could not tolerate the violent vomiting and rotten eggs burping tastem and 'losing' 2 days of my life every time I got sick. I lost only 10 pounds. My numbers did not come down, especially the fasting. My Dr. does not know I quit taking it; she will not be happy with me but that's a chance I have to take. Went back to Metformin and Glimepiride. #s are better if I watch the carbs; if I don't, they go through the roof. It would appear I'm on my way to insulin. ",5,2,2
"I am fortunate not to have experienced any of the negative side-effects that have been listed.I have been using it since March/April and my AC1 is finally below 7.I have lost about 30 lbs.and mytaken with generic version of amaryl my fasting readings are between 90-110 and an hour after meals, no more than 130. I am very satisfied with all of it except the outrageous cost.",5,3,4
I am a 53 year old female and I have been on this drug for a little over a month now and it seems to do wonders in lowering the blood sugars as well as keeping me from wanting food.  I find that the acid reflux is very annoying but I really need the weight loss.  I am lossing weight although I have not checked the scales.  My clothes are not as snug and people are noticing so I know it is working in that area.  I am still concerned about the stomach issues and may need to adjust the dose.  ,4,4,4
"I have been taking since May 22. I lost 2 lb on first week,and have stayed the same weight since,My blood sugars was good,until  Aug I had a lot of  heart burn and stop take Victoza, and blood sugars is hight and Dr chang my med Janumet 1000mg, hope is work for me, other thigs Victoza is too expensive. My ins not cover :( ",3,2,2

"45 yr. old male I have been on this medication for 1 month now.Side effects are  allready gone,MY Sugar level's are down as well as My A1c test.Weight loss around 2-4 Lbs. ",5,5,5
A1c dropped from 7.2 to 5.8 in three months. Started in May and have lost 37 pounds and still losing. Watching diet and walk 30 minitues 5 to 6 times a week. Think this combination is best for me. FEEL GREAT! Mild headache is nothing compared to how I feel overall. Love this drug!,5,5,5
Found Victoza easy to use and effective. Have had none of the documented side effects. Blood chemistries improved significantly over a two month period. Only issue is prohibitive cost. Initially tried Byetta which caused nausea which increased over time.   ,5,4,5
Getting much better sugars than with Byetta,5,5,5
"After 6 mos. weight loss of 33 pounds is great.  Morning glucose has not dropped at all, even after adding Actos.  Probably not the right med for me.",5,2,1
"Within a few days, blood sugars dropped 30-50 points pretty consistently.  Have had bad gas with the rotten egg burps and vomitted violently on day 4.",5,3,4
"Started 3 weeks ago at lowest dose.  Now at highest.  No major problems and good blood sugar levels (105 fasting, up to 150 at mealtimes). Appetite curbed and losing weight slowly (1-2 lbs. per week).",5,5,5
I developed a huge rash on my legs. I also broke out in Hives all over my body at one point when first taking this drug. I had a UTI and a yeast infection that developed on my leg and croch area that could not really be explained. I had a horrible experience with this drug. I recommend not using this unless you have no alternative.,5,2,3
"We are still experiementing with all my meds, but my sugars have dropped big time.  my morning number is still around 100-110, but after that, it RARELY goes over 150.  My biggest issue is that since I started 2 weeks ago, I have had 4 lows, and always feel sick.  My normal after meal number is usually around 110 (2 hours after meal).  if I check again in 1 more hour, it is usually in the low 80's.  Hoping a tweak of my lantus helps out.  ",5,3,5
"First: constipation. second: diarreha, nausea, vomiting. However: blood sugars are great.",3,3,3
"Easier to use than Byetta since it doesn't need to be taken twice a day and near mealtime, but does not seem curb appetite as well. Blood sugar is about the same. ",4,3,2
I have been taking this since May. I lost 12lbs and have stayed the same weight since. My blood sugars have been good. I had some heart burn last week but it is better this week. I had lost my appetite but I have noticed it is starting to come back and I am concerned. I hope this  drug doesn't only work for a short time.,5,3,4
"started drug 2 weeks ago at .6 with slight nausea and headache.  bumped up to 1.2 and have more nausea, constant mild headache and overall generally feeling tired.  Not much change in blood sugar reading yet.  ",5,4,3
"Within 2 days my numbers were down to 140 or below at all times. With insulin my morning numbers were higher than doctor wanted. I have lost 4 lbs, have slight constipation and some acid. I also have less appetite. However, ALL syptoms are more tolerable than the daytime lows I was experiencing with insulin! To me after a 3 weeks and at the .6 dosage it is a miracle drug! I hope the good news continues!!!!",4,5,5
"I do believe that the drug is helping me to shed someweight. That is great,however,I have been having pain in my abdomen like I'm very nervous. I don't know what else it could be.",5,2,2
"At first it worked. My readings went down, but nauseous and sick feeling.  No appetite, so I lost weight. Now,fourth month on the drug and my appetite is back, my numbers are back up,no more nausea, and weight is returning.  I think it loses its effect on the body.  I am on the maximum dose.  Symlin had the same history with me and I could not tolerate byetta at the maximum dose.  Unfortunately, I am still constipated.  The cost is excessive.  I doubt I will stay on it after the next Dr. visit. ",3,2,3
"Painless injections,great drop in blood sugar levels.  Cost may be a problem.",5,5,5
"I have been on this about a week. Already lost 5.5 pounds, morning sugars dropped about 50 points (were about 220 each morning).. Still at .6 dose getting ready to increase to 1.2. So far the only problem was nausea, second and third day were worse - much better now. Headache on the third day, but went away. This looks promising!",3,5,4
"I had some nausea and rotten egg burps, but it has dropped my morning blood sugar readings from 250 or higher. Now the readings are within range of 90 to 105. I am happy and my doctor is happy. Have lost 27 lbs since May 24, 2010.",5,3,3
So far its helped. Not feeling the craving I use to have.And I believe I have lost some weight . The only thing bad is the cost.Is there any help.,5,4,4
The medication is working for me but I have been having joint pain. Is this a side effect of the madication?,3,2,2
"Started Victoza 6/16/10.  Bgl remained high 300-400.  Dr added Lantus insulin on 6/23/10.  Numbers started dropping to 150-101 by 6/30/10.  On 7/6/10 became dizzy and nasus.  Stopped Victoza 7/7 continued Lantus, dr felt is was inner ear virus, went back to Victoza and Lantus and because very dizzy and ill again.  Stopped Victoza 7/11/10.  Will continue to take Metformin 1000gm am and pm and Lantus if bgl rise.  Current fasting bgl after fasting were 118 if they rise will take Lantus no more Victoza for now.  Not worth the illness that takes at lease 48 hrs to recover.  Will f/u with dr next week.",4,1,2
"on recommendation from MD, started on this med therapy 1x daily, warned about side effects most common (nausea, headaches), but they have lessened with time. I have lost weight (reasonable, not excessive 2-5lbs per wk).  Copay highest for insurance, as it is a new drug without generic alternatives.",5,3,4
i started it in june 2010 it has lowered my bgl fast but i do have some side effects ...im hoping these will ease soon . i can tell a big difference in appetite and im not hungry as often so i would recomend trying it if offered to you.,5,3,4
"started on april 9th have lost 25lbs, have some nausea and constipation. I eat a fiber bar or take benefiber and it has helped the constipation. A1C droped from 9.9 to 8.3.",5,5,5
"I have had rotten egg burps, headache and ucky feeling.  It is working for my appitite thought.  My a1c levels are pretty high. I got to go to dr to have it checked next month.  Hope it makes a difference.",5,4,5
"love this drug!!! try januvia and byetta then insulin, my fasting sugars were at the lowest 266 and highest in the 400s, started this drug 4 weeks ago and they are now 120's and even dinnertime readins of 110!! Im thrilled. Had headaches and nausea for first couple of weeks but persevered and they have gone and I ahve lost 15lbs!!",5,5,5
"took for 2 months, had headaches, nausea and diahrea/gas.  I never even got up to the highest dose either.Then developed bad pain in rt side of back area under ribs.  I stopped taking due to this as per warnings.my numbers were all over the place and crashed several times which I did not do on Januvia.  oh well.  ",4,2,4
Byetta had me doubled over in pain.  I am very comfortable on Victoza.  Hope it works.  It does decrease my appetite.  I do crave sugar a lot more for whatever reason.  ,5,5,3
"Started June 2, switched from Byetta 5 mg. Victoza has been wonderful, brought down my blood sugars to near normal, suppressed appetite, lost 10 pounds so far but no other side effects. Much easier to do 1 shot in morning not related to meals. Very hapy with it.",5,5,5
my blood sugar isnt as low as i would like it to be. i have lost no weight. have used it since feb 2010.,5,3,4
just started,5,3,2
I just started using the medication.Seems to be working for me. Lets see what happens.,4,4,4
unknown as of yet,1,1,1
This drug combined with 1000 mg of glumetza was the answer for me. I average between 82 and 111 every day.,5,5,5
loss of appetite weight loss aome slight nausea occasional pain in lower legs better than januvia or byetta,4,4,4
"Immediate constipation, nausea, heartburn that has not gone away after 3 months.   My numbers are great, but I feel sick all the time.     Dr appt at end of the month and I hope to switch doses or medicine.   ",4,1,4
"I started out great.  Sugar numberes came down, not hungry, insulin reduced.  After two months, my appetite is back, and my numbers are climbing.  I am getting back to where I was with three shots of insulin a day, but victoza is way more expensive.  I wonder if you can develop an immunity from this drug after a while?????",5,3,3
"Started this med less than a wk ago.. Bgl were bouncing all around in the 100s..139 in a.m. and up to 188 in p.m. Also have gastroparesis. Dr. rec'd to try this along with metformin. I like the steadier readings. Don't have nausea or diarrhea side effects from this but have it from the gastroparesis. HOWEVER, I have already developed acid reflux in the 5 days I have been injecting. Don't like this effect and hoping it will go away once I get used to this new drug. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with results.",5,5,5
"only been on it a week, better than Byetta. did get sick 2nd day but ok after that. it sure helps with not being hungry. ",5,3,3
"Stoped hunger,blood sugar went down,after  7 days had sevral real bad nose bleeds for two to three hours at a time.Had to stop the drug.",5,1,3
"Causing nausea in the afternoon, to the point I to stop work. Now also suffering fron acid reflux",4,4,4
"victoza has made a big difference in my am numbers from the 2oo,s to 140 and lower in the afternoon having a little nausea, but can tolerate it. have been taking for 6 weeks have been taking glipizide in pm. so far so good ",5,5,5
"i havent been on this med long ,but this is working better than januva as far as bgl they went from 220 to 120 in three days but headaches and nausa is bothersome hope it gets better with time,also maybe i can lose some weight because im never hungry.",5,3,5
"Third month on Victoza. Instant reduction in blood sugar readings at all times of day. Early am to 130 from 190. Afternoons from nearly 300 to below 140. Some nausea for 1st month or so. 8 - 10 pound weight loss. Full after eating about 1/2 amount prior to starting. Seem to be developing acid reflux in this 3rd month. Not sure if that will dissipate, but it is becoming bothersome.",4,4,5
It help me to loose weight i dont get hungry,5,5,5
"On medication 11 wks. Started at .06 dose and to increase to 1.2 dosage 2nd wk. By mid 3rd wk, I was having acid reflux and nausea so returned to lower dosage.  Lost 4 lbs. Saw MD end of 4 wks; instructed to stay on low dosage for 2wks and increase it to l.2 again.  Acid reflex returned minus nausea.  Appears I cant tolerate higher dosage.  I was taken off Januvia and placed on Victoza due to spikes in sugar level 4 hrs after meals eventhough 2hrs cks were within range.  May have to stay at low dosage or return to Januvia.  Appt at end of month.",5,3,3
"Started using 10 days ago, morning blood sugar dropped from 179 to 134, evening from 150 to 105...Some nausa in the late afternoon,",5,5,5
I have been using Victoza for a little while now. The only side effects that I have had are morning sickness and not being hungry at all.,5,5,5
"The first time I went from .06 to 1.2 I felt sick to my stomach. My doctor had be wait a little longer to change. Worked well and I've lost 30 pounds, very happy about that.  ",5,5,5
"This medicine made me very sick at 0.6 starting dose.  I started at 0.3 and moved up a little each week.  I have now been on 1.2 dose for 4 weeks.  Take the shot at 6:00 pm. I am usually too sick with nausea to do anything the rest of the evening. I have not lost any weight, nor seen any results of blood sugar owering.  It about the same. Medcine is SUPER EXPENSIVE. It covered by my insurance, but for $400  per month I would expect it to actually work ",1,1,1
Began 10 days ago with the lowest dose and side effects are dizziness and headache. Bumped it up to 1.2 now I have diarrhea and couldn't even go to work today. How long does this side effect last and can I take Imodium to control the diarrhea? ,4,1,4
This med does cause nausea but the weight loss helps a lot with your blood sugar..,5,5,5
"I was taking this but the side effects were horrible. The heartburn, nausea, great scott. I will say however that it did bring my blood sugar down very fast and kept it at 100. Needle was very small. This drug was not for me because of the side effects however if your Dr. has prescribed it to you then dont hesitate to try it. Like I said it does work and it works well.",5,1,5
"Used for 2 months, when got to full dose had continuous heartburn, diarrhea, continuous nausea & massive headache. It lowered sugars really well & added benefit of significant weight loss.  Too bad I was sick all the time. I am trying something else.",4,1,2
"Insurance forced me from Byetta to Victoza due to the cost.  I am using 1.8 once a day and getting poor am readings in the 200-250 range with Victoza so I am researching alternatives.  With Byetta I was always 140-160.  I tried Bydereon, once a week exenatide, but the needle was enormous and worse it left a lump at the injection site.  But it also contained my am reading to 140-160.  I will give Victoza another course and hope for improvement.",2,3,2
"Let me first say that I just started this medication and am still on the starter dose of 0.6, but already I can feel my cravings and desire to eat subsiding.  I have had some intermittent nausea but it's mild and tolerable. Only other side offect was a mild headache and my fasting blood sugar was 77 this morning.  77!  I am also on Invokana and Glipizide and without the Victoza my sugars were in the 180s-200s fasting.  Also, for those dreading the needle, it is tiny.  I felt only one of the three needle sticks so far and the one I did feel was much less painful than sticking my finger to check my blood sugar, which I do multiple times a day.  Don't let fear of an injection keep you from considering this medication as an option.  I will update once I have been on Victoza for a longer time.",5,5,5
"After two years of taking Victoza, my blood sugar came down from 7.0 to 5.7 A1C, and I've lost 30 pounds.  I'm thrilled!  Also, using Reli-On 4 MM/32Gauge pen needles from Walmart. Much more comfortable than the BD needles.  All I'm not too happy with is the cost of Victoza.",5,5,5
My levels are excellent and for the first time in years my weight is going down!!!  Taking this has been the best decision in a long time.,5,5,5
I would highly recommend this product to others.  I had an upset stomach when first prescribed but that only lasted a couple of weeks.  In 5 months I have lowered my A1C from 7.0 to 5.8.  I have lost 16 lbs.  I have more energy and feel great.  I take with 2x/day Metformin. I exercise daily and eat a reasonably healthy diet.,5,5,5
"WOW, tremendous reduction in daily sugar readings. Was at 300+ everyday. I took the wrong dose for 4 weeks taking 3 times per day even during the ramp up. Was told to go to once per day and the med will last longer without refills. My numbers are now 85 to 97 fasted and jump to 127 after meals. I have also lost some weight due to less appetite. It will be interesting to see if the proper dose 1.8 once a day will still keep my numbers in check.",5,5,5
very effective in controlling blood sugar,5,5,4
lowered my numbers,5,5,5
Within a week of taking it my numbers went from 190 to between 97 and 124 routinely.  My fasting numbers in the morning were slightly higher 140-154 but leveled out throughout the day.  I am taking a 2x daily dose of Metformin with Victoza. After a month I have seen weight loss of 10 pounds. If it continues I am on target to lose 60 pounds in 5 more months !!!  Slight diahrrea at the beginning of dosage. ,5,5,5
"I was fine taking .6 and 1.2 dosage, when I increased to 1.8 I had injection site hives (very large 3-4 inches) that appeared 24-48 hours after injection. I have reduced back down to 102 and the reaction has continued.",4,2,3
When i first started taking victoza it made me feel like I had a stomach virus because if the vomiting and diharrea. I stopped taking it for a week and restarted taking it. In the beginning my fasting numbers were 250+ after 3 months of taking it my numbers are 120 and less.,5,5,5
I have had good results with victoza,5,4,4
"So far, I can't write much of a comment, at this point; I have only used it for 3 days.  Also, I am taking a different oral medication at the same time (3 days).",3,2,2
"Have been taking this for 6 months with a gradual increase in dosage to 1.8 per day.  My A1C went from 9.6 to 8.1.  I expected it to be lower as I have also lost over 50 lbs.  The worst side effects I have are bloating, if I eat more than a small amount and a sour stomach of the worst kind.  Even went as far has having a bunch of Gastro tests but all were negative.  ",5,3,4
"On this medication for more than 2 years... lost 20lbs. Controls my glucose levels and A1C down from 8.1 to 6.4. No side effects, but a little constipation.  Great drug!",5,5,5
"After being nauseous for a week, the drug was fine.  The third week I started getting heartburn which continued into the 4th week.  I'm waiting to see the doctor to see if this is a typical side effect and how long it lasts.  I would hate to give it up as it has  lowered my after meal blood sugar by at least 30.  Has anyone else had this problem?",5,3,4
"Started taking this in July 2013. Nausea & diahrea was the biggest side affect. The nausea went away in a few weeks. I took the shot in the evening so wasn't nauseous all day, just in the morning. Needles are so small they hardly hurt at all. It decreased my appetite & I was able to lose 20 lbs. Still plagued with the diareha, but don't know if that is the victoza or the gallbladder surgery I had in July. My A1C went from 8.6 to 6.5. Was happy with this med. But now insurance won't cover it in 2014, so I have to try something new.",4,4,4

"I've been using Victoza for over a 18 months.  I've had no side effects.  It helped to lowere my A1C from 9.4 to 6.6.  I've lost 50 pounds and I feel better than I have in over 30 years.  For me, this drug has been a miracle.  My Endo. is saying that he will soon start cutting the dosage of the other medication I take for diabetes (metformin and glyburide and actos).",5,5,5

"Victoza has been great for me.I have lost weight and my sugar levels have gone done.My  only conplaint has been constipation,which I  use a laxative for.",5,4,5
i feel  better,5,5,5
I like the effectiveness of this medication.  In trying to get used to this medication I am alot more hungry.  I e had to adjust accordingl.,5,4,4
diabetes no problem,5,5,5
"Have been on it for a week, not sure I am going to continue.  I am hoping the nausea stops soon.  But it is lowering my sugar levels",5,3,4
"It was very easy and convenient to use this medication.  However, the nausea, inability to eat and diarrhea were so severe that I could not tolerate this medication longer than 3 days.  I could not give this medication enough time to prove it was helpful in lowering my blood sugar or not due to side effects.",5,1,2
it has helped me lose wt,5,4,4
This medication helped by blood glucose level come down from 185 in the morning before breakfast to 110 within a week. I also take metformin 500 mg 3 times a day. The down side is the nausea. Three weeks in the stomach ache and nausea were constant and after a day of barely functioning at work I stopped taking it.Plan to see my physician to see what else might help. ,4,1,4
this medication has worked very well in keeping my blood sugars in the ideal range,4,4,5
The Victoza works really well keeping my blood sugar levels down but I can't eat more than a few bites of food at a time.  The lowest dose isn't strong enough to keep my blood sugar where my doctor and I would like it to be and still causes be to feel bloated and nauseated.  (And that's before I've eaten.)  If I take the mid-range dose then I really feel terrible and can't eat at all and I get nauseous to the point of vomiting.  I really don't like this medication and I have an appointment next week to see what else we can try.,5,2,4
"I have been on this for 18 days and have a great experience.  Loss of appetite, cannot eat as much as I used to.  Lower Blood reading levels.  Very little stomach discomfort (not pain) I am an emotional eater and do not have the urges to eat as I used to.",4,5,5
have only been on Victoza for a week its been fine so far,5,3,3
"Have had issues with constipation while using Victoza, but nothing else has worked this well to control my blood sugar levels.  Amazing medication!  Very easy to use.  I have not experienced any other side effects other than a mile nausea occassionally.",5,4,5
"My doctor started me on Victoza when I started to experience high overnight blood sugar numbers.  After starting Victoza my numbers were great, but because of the cost my insurance company required me to change to Byetta.  My numbers when back up immediately.  So with an appeal the insurance company allowed the Victoza.  My blood sugar number are back to a normal range... 120 and lower. I have experienced no side effects with Victoza and it is easy to use.",5,5,5
I was very sick with this med . Very sick stomach nervous tried for 14 day couldn't do it anymore.,5,1,1
"ON metformin and glipizide my BS was high at 170 or more in the mornings,now after 2 weeks on Victoza my morning BS ranges from 70 to 100. works great for me and no side affects.",5,5,5
"I have only been on Victoza for 2+ weeks. The first week was at 0.6 and after that 1.2. The first day, I experienced slight nausea and a little back pain but it quickly subsided after a day. When I made the Jump to 1.2, no nausea but a slight bit of back pain again. After a day at 1.2, all was fine. Very quickly, my BG wne from 205 down to 150, and now at 135 and still going down, I also take the generic Actos as well as a Metformin. The Actos is in the AM and at the smallest dose. Three 500mg Metformin (1 in the morning-2 at bedtime) complete the regiment. Victoza, for me has been simple and painless. It's been effective and time will tell if there are adverse effects. I can only recommend that you see a really good endocrinologist. Get ALL your blood levels, A1C checked, and follow a better diet. I'm really bad about this but, I'm trying hard to be better. Also, stay away from all sodas, and drink V8 juice in moderation. Use Tabasco to give it some zing. Love yourself and life too! ",5,5,5
"This medicine dropped my fasting blood sugar from the 200s to 150-190 during the six weeks I was on it and I saw readings as low as 73 during the day.  However, from the first dose I had trouble sleeping more than 4 hours a night and my personality underwent a major change.  Belching was a major problem as well so after a month the doctor switched me to the 1.2 dose which helped with the gas but still not sleeping well. Before Victoza I was eating healthy and exercising 30-60 minutes a day, two weeks in I had to quit exercising because I didn't have the energy and my diet became 75% junk food.  Doctor is finally taking me off of it and going on insulin, will see if it does the trick.",3,1,3
"I have been on this drug for approximately 3 months, it has really reduced by blood sugar.  This medication has really put a halt to my old eating habits.  I have to remind myself to eat, the smell of food can fill me up.  I've learned to add more protein to my diet.",5,5,5
"Been using Victoza for over 2 years. Weight loss was minimal, but blood sugar and A1C are normal and looking great. I have a fear of needles, but after the first few days, no problems. Two plus years later, injections are a non-issue.",5,5,5
After  taking for 3 months I started feeling nauseous..started loosing weight.. by the 6 month I wound up in the hospital I wound up with pancreatitis in the hospital for a week ,1,1,1
"Took Victoza and it brought my levels down to a more normal level right away.  As time went on, I just couldn't eat, and had stomach pains.  By the end of the first month I was in the hospital for an intestinal blockage.  5 days with a plastic tube up my nose and I was released from the hospital.  Very dangerous side effects they forget to mention",4,1,4
"Victoza worked very effectively at reducing my A1C but it destroyed my taste buds making most foods, except sweets, taste terrible. I quit taking it because I wanted to enjoy the taste of food again.  Since quitting it, food again tastes OK.  I suspected that people lost weight because they experienced the same thing. I may try to go back on it intermittently because it does lower my A1C. ",5,2,5
"Was introduced to this miracle drug and while on samples from my docs, I wanted to step up and give it a real try.   Beyond belief!   Instant B.S. drop from mid to high 400's to LOW 200's within the first week. In six weeks have 18 pound weight loss but severly increased edema.   All with NO insulin!   Sad ending------- Stopped due to unreal copay{ to the tune of $286}.  Would LOVE to be back on it as it was THE ONLY med, ever, to affect my blood sugar at all.  So it is back the the 4-500's and upcoming weight gain thanks to big pharma.  ONLY in America!",5,5,5
"Started using Victoza to control blood sugar which it had done.  I have been able to back off of my novel in N by over 1/2.  I have also lost 24 pounds in 3 months on Victoza.  I kind of turns off the hungar switch, abnd it is much easier to diet and say "" I don't really want that "". We're pleased that I am using it.  If you are on Medicare, watch your cost.  I was on WellCare part D abnd Victoza was $770.00 a month.  Switched to Atena this year and it is $35.00 per month.  I just don't get these drug companies, but you can get it for a reasonable price on Medicare.",5,5,5
I took Victoza for almost as year and went to my dr. because I was having breathing problems.  He couldn't find a reason.  Then I got extreme diarrhea a couple of months later. I stopped the Victoza for a week to see if that was the problem.  It was and I also noticed my breathing got better.  I went back on Victoza and both the diarrhea and breathing problems came back so I can no longer take it.  I would become out of breath just walking from the parking lot into a store.  I was also tired a lot as I was not getting enough oxygen.  Now my energy level has also gotten better.  I was really disappointed as my A1c was lowered while I was takeing Victoza.,4,1,4
"This medication was great it lowered my A1C 2 points on the starter dose of 0.6. I felt really good on this, did not effect my energy level. The only bad issue I had was that it increased my pulse rate too high so I had to stop using it. Wish I could have kept using it best medication I have been put on that actually worked for me without side multiple side effects.",5,2,5
Works very good for me when other med failed.,5,5,5
"Its a small dose daily, but has help me lower my A1C.  Plus, seems to 'slim' my waist and 'reduce' the Fat in my Belly, gone form a Beach Ball, to a 'two pack' when tightening my belly muscles!  Did not realize I had any Stomach Muscles left!!",5,5,4
Has helped me get control of my sugar and eliminated the use of another drug with serious side effects. Don't know if it effects my sleep but since I have begun taking it I am having difficulty falling asleep (take injection after dinner.) Am going to switch to morning shots and see if any change. Have lost about 4 pounds in the month and sugar is down from mid 200's to under 200.,5,4,4
"Without using Victoza as a supplement to my insulin, my blood sugar would spike to the high 500's after eating a bowl of grain type breakfast cereal (Containing less than 8g of sugar) With the Victoza my readings are well within normal levels, high 90's an hour after eating the same thing. I only use it once in the morning and it has brought my A1C from the mid 8 range to the mid 6 range. ",5,5,5
"I started taking Victoza in February, 2013.  Since that time, my A1C has gone from in the 9s to 5.9!  I've lost approximately 40 pounds and BG stays in the 90-110 range.  I am SO upset because my insurance provider (BCBS/Express Scripts) will no longer cover this medication after 1/1/14.  How can a person's health take second fiddle to a ""business decision?""  Disgusting.",5,5,5
This drug did help me control my blood glucose readings BUT I did develop acute kidney disease & hyperkalemia after taking the medication for about 2 months. My creatnine levels spiked to 1.77 and my potassium levels were very high. The creatnine and potassium levels came back to normal after not taking this medication for 2 weeks.,5,1,3
have been on it for 1 month now. After the first week most of the side effects have deminished and have now lost almost 20lb. My blood surgers are more under control.,5,5,5
It has lowered my A1C from 7.4 to 6.2 in 3 months.  It was a rough couple months getting use to this medicine.  It made me very sick to my stomach and I belched like a sailor and the heartburn was bad.  Zantac helped with that.  I had to increase my does VERY slowly.  It took me 3 months to be able to handle the full does.  I have lost 10lbs.  through the process. My appetite is definitely smaller than it was and hope to lose more weight.,5,5,5
My a1c dropped from 7.8 to 6.2 in six months along with using levemir. Curbed my appetite. Don't eat like I used to.  I do experience more low blood sugars. Continue to lose weight.,5,5,5
Have taken for only three days for chronic diarrhea. Has caused me to lose control of my bowel movements at night and wake up to unfavorable results. Will not take anymore. ,4,1,1
"The pills are huge, hard to take and expensive, but I can't tolerate a statin and this drug has reduced my cholesterol.  Only side effect is occasional dyspepsia at night.",2,4,4
"Drug works well, but so expensive.  Mfg. sure has us over a barrel about price, and no generic in sight.  I can't take statins, so this is my only alternative.  Even with m/c part D, co pay is now up to close to $500 for 90 days.  Where is the extra help when seniors need it?  But, drug does do what is stated it will do. ",4,3,4
I take this due to high cholestrol. Very expensive however Optum RX sent a letter saying a generic may be available in the next 6 months. Makes me very tired and have been having back and side pains.  No blood test sine taking it but hoping for the best.,3,3,3
My triglyceride got to 1905 after taking this medicine for 2 month. Before I tart taking Whelchol triglyceride were 410.,1,1,1
"My cardiologist recommended Welchol because I have fibromyalgia and statins made my muscles hurt even more. The drug has lowered my cholesterol but to my surprise, it has solved my digestion problems. I no longer get heartburn or GERD, and food gets digested much more quickly. The only problem I have with it is the expense. I don't take 6 a day because it's just too expensive, I take two. I'm sure that my cholesterol numbers would go lower if I took more per day. ",4,4,4
very hard to swallow and it takes my appetite,2,3,5
"I am using the powder form and after almost giving up on being able to swallow it mixed with a variety of juices, water, etc. I found that mixing it in the blender work -- at least I'm able to swallow it.  I use apple juice and, for me, the diet or ""lite"" versions of juices don't mix well.  Not sure why.",2,2,3
"Been battling high cholesterol for years.  Statins give me severe body aches.  I have multiple sclerosis so don't need any more discomfort.  I've been on Welchol over a year and after 3 months my numbers were great.  I use it in conjunction with ZETIA.  Didn't work without the ZETIA, but on Zetia alone, didn't bring my numbers into normal range.  Dislike taking six giant pills a day, but little problem for the good it does me.",3,5,5
My insurance company will no longer let me take Vytorin or Crestor so I have been taking this drug for over a year and my cholesterol is still in the 200 range. Thanks UHC!! ,4,1,1
I have been taking Welchol for almost 2 months and my Dr hasn't check me for results,3,3,3
The drug has been effective in lowering my chol numbers.  It is a bit of a pain to take with everything else I take but I work around it by taking this 4 hours before and 4 hours after I take the other stuff.  One thing that keeps happening to me though is I keep getting bladder infections.  I read last night that could be a rare side effect.  I wanted to hear if anyone else out there is having this issue.,3,3,5
"headache, muscle weakness, sick to my stomach, just an overall not with it feeling. Do not like this medication. ",2,1,1
"Can not take Statins because of the side effects it caused. On Welchol for 2 months now, Have not had a second blood test yet.Been having headaches with eye problems and been very tired.Take the powder in orange juice and using a whisk works well to mix.Will continue to take until I see what my numbers look like.",3,3,2
"I'm taking this for relief of symptoms associated with liver disease.  I was an itchy, nauseated mess before WelChol, and I couldn't possibly appreciate the relief this drug has been any more.  Now, despite this, there are a few things to note: 1) It made me incredibly constipated. If you're gonna take Welchol, start taking Metamucil or Benefiber or whatever fiber supplement you want right away or you will be VERY uncomfortable.  2) It made my stools look different - sort of fatty looking, which can be a bit unnerving.  Other than that, it's been a huge relief to me and I'll continue to use it for as long as necessary.",5,5,5
"I took one pill,then skipped a day,then took another pill, per doctor's orders. The next day I developed severe lower abdominal pain that doubled me over: nearly fainted,got cold sweat,then chills.I took to the bed, excruciating pain continued for five hours. Pain has diminished somewhat, and I can stand up straight.However, I am still ill. Eating toast and tea. I will never take Welchol again. It poisoned me.",3,1,1
"I have been taking Welchol for about six months. My glucose, triglycerides, thyroid, AIC, daily glucose check, are all significantly higher since starting this drug. I am also coughing persistently. I am going cold turkey.  I don't think this is a good drug at all.",1,1,1
"Had severe back and head pain, as well as extreme fatigue.  Suffered thru two months, with good results - cholesterol wise.  Just couldn't take the side effects.  I'd like to know how long before they subside.",3,2,4
"I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in August with A1C at 6.8. My doctor prescribed Welchol (and we tested to make sure the insurance covered the cost at a reasonable price, which it did at $45/month). The doctor prescribed this particular med because I have a serious family history of coronary disease. I've been taking the 3 huge pills twice a day since and my most recent tests (late November) came back with an A1C of 5.4 (my lowest ever), with LDL of 52, triglycerides of of 80 (the first time this number was under 100)! I've also been following a simple eating program of 1/4 carbs, 1/4 protein, and 1/2 veggies....I do not count calories and I have not been exercising at the level I should. I've dropped 15 pounds (from 197 lbs.) Needless to say, I've been most satisfied with this product...the holistic approach has provided excellent results. ",5,5,5
"It works well, but the cost is way to high. It cost me $600 a month with insurance. I  can not take the other dugs because of my liver and pains in my joints ",1,1,4
"I have read hundreds of reviews of this medication and I have decided to make this a research project for me (and maybe others in the same boat as me). I am a 61 yr. old female. I have Hypothyroidism, Fibromyalgia, Osteoarthritis, IBS, and have 2 stents (so I need my Cholesterol to be real low. Well it is not, and I can't take statins of any kind because of severe muscle weakness and pain. But I really want this medication to work and would love it to lower my weight also. I will be submitting a progress report on this medication every month. Hopefully it will be my great big success story. Because I have so many obstacles in my life--I will start with 2 pills once a day for a week, then I will do 3 pills once a day for a week, until I get up to the full dosage of 6 a day.. Wish me luck..Praying that this works.Wish me luck. Ruthann B.",5,3,3
"I was told to take this drug because I was not able to take statins. Well let me first tell you.. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOU HAVE A THYROID CONDITION. IBS. ANXIETY OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.   I had the worst side effects ever.. The pill is 625mgs and you have to take 6 per day.. Well I took 1/2 of 625 and I almost wound up in the ER.. Nausea, Cramps in my stomach, heart palpitations, sweating with burning skin and then to top it off my blood pressure went up lie a rocket.  I had to take a tranquilizer to calm down the palpitations.. If your not good with taking medications, the doctors are not always right.. If I would have taken what they said. I would not be alive today.. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG..",1,1,1
"Was prescribed this medicine for acid reflux after gall bladder surgery.Quit taking it after severe abdominal pain,gas,and bloating.",2,1,1
At first I tried the power. It was horrible. Now I take the tablets. This has only been for about a month and it seems to be OK. I have taken every statin on the market and have had severe joint pain. Welchol seems to be OK. ,4,4,4
"I take this medicine for IBS. It has been a wonderful med for me,no problems what so ever!",3,5,4
"Caused me to be constipation, in sever stomach pain. Went to clinic. they would not give me anything for pain send me home thought i was going to die. Went back to doctor. Told him thought it was welchol was causing pain. I told him i thought 625mg 3 times a day was to much. He told me i was not suspose to take but 1 or 2 a day. When i told him that was what was on my bottle he might as well called me a liar. I heard him call pharmacy. When he came back never mention it . Said if it does not get better may have to do surgery for blocked bowels. Do doctores care any more? And if your passed 75 they can blame it on patient, they  are demented.",1,1,1
"My total cholesterol levels have historically been in the 180 to 200 range. However, LDL levels were borderline high and HDL levels would not increase. Was reluctant to get involved with statins, so MD suggested Welchol. Have been taking (6 tab/day) for slightly over one year with no noticeable undesirable side effects. Testing on 2 occasions since commencing drug show total now LT 150 and LDL in the low 80's. Triglyceride levels have also lowered (now 122). I have no other health issues. Only other med is 1 aspirin per day and 1 Ocuvite per day. At this point, I am very satisfied with the results.",4,4,5
"This drug is expensive.  It seems to be one of the only drugs I can take, I am intolerant to statins, so I take it but am trying to find an alternative that is less expensive.",3,1,3

Extreme muscle pain and weakness. Muscles not healing after exercise. Triglicerides elevated from 150 to 500 after 3 months. Cholesterol same as before starting medication.,3,1,2
"My blood sugar went way up until I quit taking Welchol.  My blood pressure went way up and is still up weeks after coming off the drug.  I took the drug for only 1 week, but blood sugar and blood pressure was adversely affected almost immediately.    I have diabetes, but am not on insulin or do I take statins.  Further research reveals to me the maker of this drug must realize some people will be adversely affected, and they recommend people take either statins or insulin if they take this drug.  It was not meant to be taken alone as was prescribed for me. ",3,1,1
"I am finding that it is helping me lower my cholesterol.  In addition, it has lowered my A1c 10 points within 2 wks of starting it.  Pills are large but do-able.  Powder is awful!",5,5,5
I have stage 3 liver disease so this is one of the few medications I can take (safely) to manage  my cholesterol. I have had excellent results and no problems with tolerance. There are no generics available for Welchol yet so its expensive. I changed jobs and my new insurance (U_H_C) refuses to pay for Welchol & demand that I switch to cholestyramine (Questran). I hope it does not worsen my liver disease. I have very little left... We'll see. I hate that insurance companies can dictate medical care. ACA is going to make things a lot worse.,5,5,5
I have been experiencing a lot of pain in my joints and legs...similar to what I experienced on statins,3,2,2
It was terrible. Made me hurt terrible around my chest and ribs. Would not take it again.,1,1,1
"makes me feel full and  not hungry, have gas problem  no pain",4,4,4
I had terrible stomadh pain,5,5,5
I'm a 66 yr old F. I take 3 pills I the AM and 3 in the PM. Other than gas I find no problems with them. I had severe pain on statins. The co pay with my Medicare and supplemental insurance is $40 and that is hard to pay. Statins co-pay was just $4 but the pain was unbearable. My income is small so it hurts in a different way. My numbers are improving. Anther prescription before this one  the copay was $180. I didn't get those and called my Dr. The Welchol is a trial to see if I can take it but except for the money it seems to be working out ok.,3,3,3
"Same muscle pain with this that I had with Statins - very disappointing, since this was an attempt to find something I could take.  I didn't make the connection immediately, just as it took months for me to figure out that the Statins were causing the stabbing pain at rest that I was having in chest, shoulders and arms.  It's back, and I will take the risk of having high Cholesterol any day over that pain.",2,1,3
I took my first dose (free trial)of the powder today. Nasty stuff. Called pharmacy to find out the price. They told me $134.50 WITH my Medicare. I sure can't afford that!!!! Just called the doc to get something else.,1,1,1

"Have lost 40 lbs...in 6 months.  Been on over a year.  Doctor says level still high try another 3months and retest..She doubled my thryoid med about 6 months.  Other meds had back pain and  kidney cysts .  Having trouble with prolapse uterus and bladder 6 months after starting.  Doc says coincidental??? Started taking 60 now 61. Cost of meds...make buying food expensive..so maybe stress and $$ reason for wt. loss...Taking BP, thryoid meds too so not much left over for food especially lately the cost this year has tripled in this area.... for food.

"I'm a 46 y/o male. Five months ago, my total cholesterol was 281 and my LDL was 199. I can't tolerate statins so my doctor suggested Welchol. Since my cholesterol was so high, I also switched to a plant-based diet (no meat or dairy) and cut back on sugar. I also started going for walks in the morning before work. Yesterday my latest blood test results showed that my total cholesterol is now 193 and my LDL is 125. It's the first time in 15 years that my cholesterol has been below 200. The diet and exercise certainly helped and I'm sure Welchol helped push my numbers even lower. I take the powdered form that mixes with water. The slimy texture took some getting used to, but it's a small price to pay compared to the benefits it provides. ",4,5,5
"I used the pill form of Welchol Oral and could not tolerate, then try the powder form.First three doses my throat came very itchy (that should have been a clue), the fourth dose my throat just swelled shut after the first swallow. I actually could not breath, thought I was dying. Actually I was. Then all of a sudden the swelling subsided and I could breath little small breaths. Still not over that experience.What a wake up call.",1,1,1
"After a quadruple bypass and 9 stents, I have to be extremely careful with my cholesterol levels.  Crestor and the like busted my liver.

I have stopped taking this med!!   ",1,1,1
Been prescribed this med for diarrhea and IBS that Ive had for years. Has helped with diarrhea but now I have terrible heartburn/stomach distress!Will consult with GI doc.,3,2,3
I stopped taking statins after 10+ years due to memory issues.  I tried to eat better and increase exercise but levels crept above 200. My doctor suggested Welchol and I have been on it for about 30 days.  I am e peri ending severe hip and leg pain that forced me to ER to see if I somehow had a fracture. X-rays were negative.  Taking Percocet or Valium to get through the work day and stopping Welchol as of now.,2,1,3
"I have gained 10 pounds. I know it is the medication as that is the only variable, diet, exercise, other medications have remained the same. I meet with my MD in a few days and he may order blood tests to see if it has lowed my cholesterol. I have also experienced the gas and muscle pains that others have, but I am most concerned with the weight gain. I'm not especially satisfied with the medication, and honestly could not suggest that others speak with their MD's about starting it.",3,1,3
I have been having migraines and itching. Wondering if these could be a side effect of the Welchol.,4,3,4

On for 2 weeks and not seeing any reduction in blood sugar.  How long does it take for blood sugar reduction to take place?,4,2,1
"Put on this medication for chronic diarrhea. I take 6 pills a day and so far it has helped. I also have high cholesterol and am type 2 diabetic. I also take Crestor and 2 shots plus metformin for my diabetes. My glucose levels have improved greatly, but am having low levels. My doctor didn't really tell me when or how to take the pills and after reading some of the reviews, I know when to take them. I still have chronic diarrhea so I need to get with my doctor about this drug, but it could be because of not knowing when to take it.

"My Cholesterol numbers are great. This medicine brought my numbers from 245 to 195. I have been taking Welchol for 18 months. The first year I have had no side effects. About 6 mos. ago I began to have severe pain in my lower back, left hips and down the left leg. I began Chiropractic treatment with no relief. Then 3 mos ago I decided to have a hystorectomy because of fibroid ( thinking this was the source of my pain) But the pain has continuosly increased and going to work everyday has become difficult. Finally I thought I would stop taking my Welchol and see if it helps, so 30 days ago I stopped taking it. Today I am pain free. Since I can't take statins, I will have to use alternatives for lowering my cholesterol. I have done some research and mostly woman have issues with welchol.",3,1,5
"10 "" of my large intestine removed because of large polyp.  Now I have diarrhea.  My Gastro guy prescribed Welchol. He said my food is moving thru my system to fast.  I now have upper stomach distress (Pain)and diarrhea.  ",1,1,1
"I'm 44 have high triglycerides. I've been taking this drug for two months. It actually cured my diarrhea issues. I was excited to find a cure for this problem, but I've noticed every time I take the pills I feel like they get stuck in my esophagus. I feel like I'm choking for several hours after taking it. I plan on calling my doctor tomorrow to see if I'm allergic to the welcol.  I've tried serveral meds for this triglyceride issue an have had serious side effects. I hope this one works and the side effects can be controlled somehow. ",2,2,2
This medicine has caused severe leg & muscle pain.,3,2,3
The medication is easy to use. But as a retiree I find it cost prohibative.,5,5,5
"I took the prescribed dose of 6 tablets (625mg each) 3 after lunch and 3 after dinner for 5 days. Diarrhea developed on 3rd day and got progressively worse, severe back pains developed on 4th day. Called Dr. and he said to stop the WelChol. Have been off WelChol for 4 days and diarrhea is worse. I guess it is the medication working its way out of my system. This is my own personal experience with this medication.",2,1,1
"Caused severe gastro intestinal issues, i.e., severe gas and bloating, irregular bowel activity even with drinking plenty of water, aggravated hemorroids, and caused a general drop in energy level due to these issues. ",1,1,1

"Unable to take statins because of side effects.  Doctor prescribed Welchlor powder.  Took for one month and stopped because of side effects including muscle pains, shortness of breath, chest, stomach and back pain.  Been off for two weeks and muscle pains have gone away, but still have stomach, chest, back pain and just not feeling good.  Doctor says to give it another week or so and see if I feel better.  If not he wants me to do a cardiac work up.  Felt fine before I started this drug.",1,1,1
"I have been using WelChol since Aug 2007 and have had no problems. I currently take 3 tablets per day. I am prescribed to take them twice a day, but usually forget at night since this is the only Rx I would take at night. My total cholesterol was 256 and this brings it down to an average of 200. I really have not changed my diet as I should. Also, if I was consistent with the twice a day plan, I would expect the numbers to drop below 200.  I scored this lower for the Ease of Use category due to the 6 pills a day Rx. The pills are no bigger than 600mg Motrin.  I unfortunatley have to change due to my insurance copay for Name Brand has doubled and I need to try a generic alternative which does not enter my blood.",3,5,5
"I started taking WelChol in Nov for High Cholesterol.  3 months later was down at a normal level.  The only side effects I have had is being really gassy.  I do find it hard to remember to take the 3 pills with lunch and 3 pills with dinner everyday- since a big problem I have is skipping meals and eating a lot at 1 time.  But, taking these pills is making me work on it.  The pills are on the big side - but, easy to swallow with water - no real taste to them.  I do have to say I am glad I have Insurance since I have been on this medication.  3 months worth for over $100 with insurance.  ",3,4,5
"I can't take statins.  I take Welchol and Zetia and it keeps my cholesterol below 200.  Even with good insurance, taking these two drugs is over $100 per month out of pocket, but then again I am saving big money on toilet paper since I no longer poop.  I can't take Welchol within about 4 hours of my Coumadin or it renders the Coumadin ineffective, so I rated it low on the ease of use scale.",2,4,5

"Was put on this medication for high cholesterol and blood sugar control. Have been on it for 1 month so I have not had blood work done yet. will report later. Taking 3(675mg)pills, twice a day. Was concerned about 6 pill a day dosage so I called pharmacist and was told that was a normal dosage. She mentioned the powder option if I had trouble taking pills.  So far the only side effects were a couple of days of stomach upset but that soon went away. So much better than Statins that I was on that gave me bad pain in hip joints and migraines. No problems with constipation at all. Started diet and exercise program at same time as starting this drug. Blood sugar came down so fast that I wondered if my blood testing meter was broken! Sugar hasn't been this low in several years. Curious to see what blood work will show in 2 months.",5,5,5
"I've been taking the 6 pills (3 with lunch, 3 with dinner) for 1 month now.  I gave 3 stars for effectiveness because I don't know how well it's working -- will get tested in a couple of months.  What I *can* report is that I have had ZERO constipation.  I think taking it with meals, and getting sufficient fluid intake throughout the day, is very important while on this med.  If anything, I am *more* regular now, than before.  Also, I seem to be sleeping better (not waking up as often, nor for more than a few seconds).  ",5,5,3
I have found taking the packet with juice and/or water extremely unpleasant. I am waiting to complete the course of treatment and to have my lipid levels tested. I plan to ask my doctor for another cholesterol med.,1,1,2

"I cannot take statins due to severe heartburn from the first dose. Zetia did not do enough so my doctor started me on Welchol almost a month ago. Started with the powder that is mixed in liquid. It was absolutely the worst medicine I have ever had to take. It gave me a sore throat every time I took it, I felt sick to my stomach and I had a daily headache from the aspartame. Last week I asked for the tablet form and have taken 2 doses of the tablets so far....6 at a time. They go down easy for me even though they are large pills. No sore throat, no headache and I find them to be so much easier to tolerate. Time will tell if I can tolerate the med for the long term, but for now I find the tablets to be the way to go for me. Hopefully this med will make a difference. ",5,3,3
"Been taking for 18 months. It has a disgusting taste but minimal unpleasant side effects. Shake powder well in 1/2 bottle of water for best mixture.

"This drug caused me to have severe Pancreatitis.I was admitted to the ER. and then to the ICU, for 4 days. I was in severe pain,and underwent many tests before a procedure(E.R.C.T.) to remove several small stones and sludge from my common bile duct.As a result of the seriousness of this,I was very debilitated. I was hospitalized for 16 days and had to spend 20 days in a rehab. facility. I have been at home now for 6 weeks, and am still home-bound, receiving physical therapy.",4,1,1

"This is a miracle drug for me. I had horrible side effects after having my gall bladder out over 6 years ago.

It truly is four magic pills a day and I cannot thank my doctor enough.",5,5,5
"I took this medication, twice of the dosage of 625mg. Caused sever constipation, it took over 8 days to relieve the constipation, it had the consitancy of cememt. I drink large amounts of water and this did nothing to help with the problem. Dr advised laxitives which did nothing for relief. Discontinued use of the medication, due to the constipation, after two tablets tearing my bowels up.",1,1,1
"I'm 35 years old with familial hypercholesterolemia and am taking Welchol 3.75g powder, Crestor 40mg, and Niaspan 2,000mg daily, in addition to adherence to a rigorous diet. My cholesterol has been as high as 435 total with LDL well over 300 without any medications or diet control. With Crestor, Niaspan and the highly limited diet my total cholesterol reached as low as 220 total and with unfavorable ratios. Adding Welchol has reduced total cholesterol to 168, 100% of which was due to drop in LDL. I'm sure the Niaspan and diet are gradually taking hold as well as my body gets used to them, but this dramatic shift to the first favorable numbers and ratios I've experienced in my entire life certainly makes drinking this horrible powder more palatable.   It's worth noting that one must consume a very large quantity of water throughout the day to avoid constipation while taking Welchol. However, adhering to this level of hydration plus the diet and even the Welchol have made me as regular as clockwork. Drink lots of water!",2,4,5
I have done much better with my cholestrol and sugar levels than I did on statins which gave me a lot of muscle problems ,4,5,5

Welchol has not lowered my cholesterol very much and it has caused me to be nausea,fatigue,bloating an lots of gas,tingling in both hands,constipation. chest pains an lower back pain. Got off for a month an have seen a great improvement in all areas,started back for a week and guess what?   it all started up again. I have proved to myself that this drug is harmful to me and I  am quitting it today!!!!! ",1,1,1
I read a review on here saying the people who are complaining about muscle pain and fatigue are just fat and old. Well I am 34-5'8 and weight 145. Not fat or old and have had horrible stomach pain and muscle pain since starting this. Also nausea and fatigue. Will be talking to my doctor to let him know we need to try something else because this medication has been terrible.,3,1,2
can this medication hzrm your liver or pancrease,2,2,2
"After major reactions to Lipitor and other statins, my MD suggested Welchol.  I take 6 tabs a day and really don't have any stomach or bowel issues as indicated by some. I do have some tingling in the finger tips as reported by one.  Disappointing results after 9 months of only a 10% reduction in cholesterol.  Never, ever would I put another statin in my body though, I was nearly an invalid due to muscle loss.  Just last week I learned from a cardiologist that some patients taking statins have had muscle detach from ligaments with severe reactions, I definately was headed in that direction.  I believe it's a failure of the medical profession not to emphasize the risks with this so often described class of drugs called statins.  A friend of mine lost the use of his right arm.  After a few months off the drug he was able to regain full use again.  ",4,2,2
I have been on welchol for 1 year for bowel problems and it has been a miracle although it has lowered my LDL which has always been normal. Overall I couldn't live with out it .,5,5,5

Stomach pain and constipation.,3,1,1
"Been on this med for a little over 4 months. Started with the powder. Worst stuff I have ever taken! It never dissolved, now matter how I treated it, it burned my throat, made me throw up and gave me terrible heartburn. I asked for the pill form after 6 weeks of trying to tolerate the powder. My latest blood work shows that my cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL have all gone up! Plus, my A1C has increased by 0.5%! But my glucose measurements are in normal range.  I thought this drug was supposed to help all of this and it has proven to do the opposite. I feel tired all the time, have terrible constipation and despite taking it 8 hours after levothyroxine, my TSH is also increasing.  Has anyone else had their A1C increase rather than decrease, despite their glucose measurements being in the normal range?  Not sure whether I want to stay on this medicine, but I had terrible heartburn that nothing would ease for the two days I took Previstatin and Zetia did not do too much (but at least I did not have side effects).  Doctor has now tried to get me to take omega3 fish oil capsules to help with the cholesterol, but I have to keep explaining that I am deathly allergic to fish of any kind and will not willingly take anything that might have any fish protein in it. Something like that could kill me!!! My frustration level is rising exponentially. My new cardiologist is convinced I can add a different statin to my regimen, but I fear the same heartburn results from any of the statins. ",5,2,1
Allergic reaction - swelling & redness of skin around eyes & nose,5,1,1

"I only have taking this in the powder form twice.  Both times after taking it, I would start feeling sick in about an hour after and the feeling progressed as the day went on. For several hours afterwards I felt like doing nothing except laying down. It just is an overall not great feeling and it last for hours. I thought maybe it could have been something else the first time.  But when I took it again this time I put more food on my stomache thinking maybe you really need to coat your stomache and the same lousy lingering illness came back. My doctor prescribed it for my cholesterol and type 2 diabetes.  My diabetes numbers were down those two days. Not enough time for the cholestorol. ",2,2,1
"Increase in LDL to 201 from 158 with 6 tablet per day regimine; total Cholesterol 258.

Previous response to cholestramine powder with zetia resulted in high CPKs. Was on cholestramine for ten years with decreasing effectiveness over time.  Initially, started cholesterol lowering medications with Provocol (Statin) and quickly developed high CPKs and intense muscle pain in thighs ....could not walk in the final example. ",4,1,1
The medication and watching my diet have kept my cholesterol under control.,5,5,5
"I just started taking the pill form today.  I cannot take statins.  I tried Crestor, Zetia, Simvastin.  I have procrastinated taking the Welchol because of all these terrible comments.  I am literally scared to death. Working full-time and going to school full time I can't afford to be nauseated or in any pain. My HDL is good (63), my Tri's are good (118), but my LDL keeps creeping up for a total cholesterol level of 300 today at the docs.  She and I both believe it is genetic as I really watch what I eat and I am always on the move on the job (I'm a teacher so never sit down), but I do smoke.  The doctor says that quitting will cut my cholesterol LDL by 40 or 50 points.  Has anyone else quit smoking and saw such a dramatic drop?  I will let you know how I do on this Welchol  I have 18 days to sample it.  The first negative pain I get I'm stopping it.",4,1,1
"This drug was terrible, I had so many side effects.  Nausea, fatigue, insomnia and the most disturbing was short term memory issues.  My job was being impacted.  I stopped taking the drug and in 2 days I noticed a dramatic improvement in my thought process, sleep patterns and energy level.  I have now been Welchol free for several weeks and I have felt wonderful.   And to top it all off, my cholesterol went up 20 points while taking it.  ",2,1,1

"I cannot take statins due to severe GERD. The statins caused unbearable heartburn for 2 days that made me cry. Doctor prescribed Welchol Oral suspension about a month ago without asking whether I would prefer pills or the powder. the powder does NOT mix well with ANY liquid. It irritates my throat each time I take it and causes gas and some heartburn for several hours afterward for me. It also causes a dull headache, which I now attribute to the aspartame in the powder. Already had severe constipation from other meds I take and this made it even worse! Stool softener has done nothing to help. I would rather take a dozen huge pills a day than this powder mixed in liquid. My numbers have come down slightly, but my triglyceride has gone up. Despite at least 8 hours between my levothyroxine and the welchol, my TSH is increasing. I will be asking for the pill form tomorrow. Hopefully I will tolerate that because this powder stuff is disgusting. ",2,1,2
"Been on Welchol Oral for 3 weeks. I was given it without any consultation as to whether I would like it or the pills. I had bad times with statins (terrible heartburn and muscle aches. Tried Zeita without much change in numbers, but tolerated Zetia well. This is the worst medicine I have ever had to take. It does not mix well with any liquid, whether hot or cold, gives me a sore throat for hours after drinking the liquid and I get a headache every time I take it, which I now know is from the aspartame in it. I cannot stomach eating of drinking for at least an hour after taking it, despite being told to drink a big glass of water and immediately eat a full meal right after I take the med. Tried that early on and became sick to my stomach. For hours after taking it and even after eating, I feel queasy. I would much rather take 6 huge pills a day than this junk and plan to tell my doctor to either switch my prescription or take me off of it completely. I work in a lab, so I have tested my blood twice since starting it with no changes except my triglyceride has gone way up! It has also increased my TSH levels and yes, I take this med 8 or more hours AFTER taking my levothyroxine; way more than the recommended 4 hours between them (or the 2 hours the pharmacist told me. And I do not even want to talk about the constipation. Whoever thought that making something like this was a good idea was VERY wrong!I know I will be staying on this medication...at least not in this form. Whether the pills will work for me is another question. ",1,1,2
"I have felt so weak it was hard walking.  I am dizzy, suffer from constipation, and feel flushed.  My blood pressure has been going up and down. Could not even exercise.  I stopped using it about five days ago and am feeling a little better. Have an appointment with my doctor on Monday.",5,1,3

"I've been taking Welchol for suspension (powder) 3.75g once a day for 6 months now. It has lowered my cholesterol, eliminated my long standing bowel problems and dramatically lowered my A1C. If you use a fork to vigorously dissolve it, there is no clumping or difficulty drinking. This has been an unexpected miracle drug for me. I hit the donut hold and it is expensive but it has improved my quality of life with only occasional, mild, brief nausea. Statins are poison to me.",3,5,5

My doctor recently prescribed WelChol 625 mg.  He has me taking 6 tablets a day.  That seems like it's an extremely high dosage.  When I questioned the dosage amount he said that it was the correct dosage.  Question-does anyone else take that high of a dosage?,4,3,3
"Been on it for 6 months and it has help to lower my overall cholesterol. I had such pain while taking statins, this has been a relief. Little pain, compared to the statins.

Typically not a complainer but those post dont help anyone come to a realistic conclusion. So, my 2 cents coming from a person confirmed with 'statin' pain, is this worked for me, with no pain and lowered my chol. Hope it helps you.",4,4,5
"I have been on Welchol for 5 mos and have every intention of staying with this treatment.  My Cholesterol was LDL 210 and HDL was 69.  After 45 days of treatment my total cholestreol total is 95 for both LDL and HDL.  I have also lost 65 lbs with is med in conjunction with victoza as my endo advised me that this combination of drugs not only got my diabeties under control but also a great combination for weight loss.  I too suffer from fibro and rhemo artho and was on massived muscle, pain pills and steroids for over 5 years.  all meds are now discontinued.  and will continue to stay on this combo as this has been a life saver for me.",5,5,5
I have used for a while in conjunction with another cholesterol lowering drug. Also has benefits for keeping sugar levels good,4,3,3
"Begsn taking one Welchol 625 mg tablet each day for cholestrol one year ago.  Had been unable to take any of the statin drugs as they caused leg and arm pain to the point I had trouble walking up and down stairs or getting up from a chair.    My job at the time required me to walk 5 miles a day and with one tablet, my cholestrol began to come down.  The doctor said to start taking 2 tablets so it would drop faster.  After a week of taking 2 pills, I'm now having the pains I experienced with the statins.  I'm going back to one pill a day as I had no serious side effects but with 2, now I have pain and constipation despite the high fiber diet and water.  Reducing the dosage may take longer to lower cholestrol, but at least I can take the medicine.",3,2,3
"I, LIKE MANY, AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH CONSTIPATION.  CALLED DR.  NURSE SPOKE TO ME AND SAID TO STOP FOR 2 WEEKS AND TRY AGAIN. WHILE TAKING IT, I HAD A SLIGHTLY PAINFUL,  FULL, HARD FEELING IN MY BELLY WITH REFERRED PAINS IN MY SHOULDERS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES EVERY DAY. IT'D PASS, BUT I HAVE NO APPETITE AND CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM. I TAKE THE HERB CASCARA AND DRINK GREEN TEA TO KEEP THINGS MOVING.   I WANT THE MEDICINE TO WORK FOR ME.  I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER ""GO"" IN A COUPLE WEEKS.",5,1,1
"This medication caused me to have multiple bowel movements daily,which inflamed my hemmorhoids, and made my stomach distended. It also caused some muscle pain and weakness after taking it a while. It made me miserable. ",1,1,1
"Can't take stains and with Welchol I have lost strength in muscles, difficulty walking, balance and dizziness.  Also have severs shoulder joint pain and neuropothy in legs.  Reading the comments here plus other research I am stopping taking Welchol Chloresteral is 222 and ratios and good chl are excellent.  Welchole is just not woth the side effects.  Am now taking CoQ10, Fish Oil, and had already made a life style diet change to lower chlor, plus exercise  If that's not good enough it'll just have to do as I've had it with the meds.  The prescription shouldn't be worse than the ailment!!  Appreciate all of your comments folks.  Good to know that I'm not totally crazy after all and that others have experienced the similar effects.  My cardiologists is going to be pissed but at 67 I can deal with that and/or fire him.  My health has gone downhill since on this med and I'm getting it back..Good luck all",4,1,2
Been on Welchol about 1 yr.  Lots of leg weakness and lower back and abdominal pain.  Stopped it for about a month and the pain and weakness stopped.  I started on the pills (6/day) and about 6 months ago went to the powder.  Either way is bad.  I told the doctor that I had stopped because of the pain and weakness and he said the Welchol did not cause it but it is strange that after I stopped the med for a while the symptoms went away.  I have been back on it for about 2 weeks and the pain/weakness is back.  My doctor doesn't seem to want to discuss an alternative. ,1,1,2
"I was prescribed this medication 3 months ago and although it does have some side effects such as constipation and some stomach pain, the results I got back on my tests today were wonderful.  My overall cholesterol went from 236 to 180; My LDL went from 159 to 109!  Although it is sometimes a hassle to talk all the pills, in the end I will continue using it.  I have been unable to take statins so this is great for me.  I am also type II diabetic and take Metformin so I am hoping Welchol will help with that as well.",4,5,5
"I have been on this drug for about 3 weeks, and it seems to be a big help for my GERD and sleep at night. I came looking to see if there were any beneficial side effects noted, but I have not yet found any here. The GERD improvement may be coincidental with the start of this medication, but I'll keep looking. It seems counter intuitive that my improvement had nothing to do with this medication.",4,5,4
I have been on this meds since December last year. My recent blood test shows that my LDL is improved. It does not have any other side effects except it also lowered my HDL (not sure if it's really related to this meds). I also last 6 pounds and I am pretty happy about it and hoping it can help me to lose more weight. ,3,3,4
"I just started taking Welchol a few weeks ago, so far so good. No side effects. I have not rated its effectiveness yet as I will not have labs done until May. I am also ""labeled"" pre diabetic so the benifits of lowering blood sugar hopefully will help as well. I guess my only complaint would be taking 4 pills a day, as well as the pills are quite large.",4,5,1

I'm 6'1"" 200 lbs...and feel to 185lb in such a short span it lead to severe tiredness and nausea.  I'm angry the doctor put me on this drug....it literally had a toxic effect on me....I felt it was killing me.

Peace to all....c2",1,1,1
I had a severe reaction.  Itchins and painful leg cramps after taking 3.75 g of this drug.  I now have 26 packets that I cannot use.  I would like to suggest that a starter dose be given to patients to avoid the cost to seniors on a fixed income.,1,1,1
"I am absolutely UNable to take statins. Ive tried them all with terrible cramps, aches and pain, in my legs, and all through my body. Im also a diabetic type 2. My Dr. recently put me on Welchol and took me OFF Metformin, as I was having terrible and constant frequent bouts of very loose bowl movements. ( We found out it was the Metformin causing it ). I feel like a new person with a future now. Im taking 2 Welchol three times a day with meals. So far its agreeing with me fine with one brief time of constipation. It corrected itself. Its to early to tell if it will help my cholesterol, but Im betting its going to be alot better than it has been. It is also controlling my diabetes well. Now if I loose a few pounds, Good for me. !!!! Im a retired R.N. and after what Ive been through with some of these medications, Im willing to give Welchol a good chance.  ",4,4,4
"I started on welchol dec 20th 2010.  I was on it for 7 weeks and dropped 16 pounds, became severely fatigued and could hardly make it through my work day.  I told my doctor how I was feeling and he ignored my symptons.  I told him the only new pill I'm on is Welchol. ""could this be causing this?'  he said I must be depressed that weight loss and fatigue are 2 symptoms.  I stopped taking welchol after leaving his office extremely upset that he just ignored my symptoms.  I have been off welchol for 8 days now.  I'm energetic and haven't lost another pound!!!!  HUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3,1,3
"About 3 weeks ago my doctor insisted that I try Welchol 3775 Oral Suspension.  I tried to tell him that I can not take any kinds of meds because of the side effects.  He said the only side effect would be constipation.  I stated it two weeks ago and the first 3 days I was totally fine.  I thought gee, this actually might work.  WRONG! On the 4th day I started with severe diarrhea.  I call my doctor and he told me that yes, it can go either way..either it treats people with severe diarrhea or makes it worse.  I am off this and I still have diarrhea.  I also didn't feel right.  Now watching the news the other night, it was said that more doctors should stop writting scrips and tell the public if you honestly want to watch your levels, eat right, diet and exercise which we all know we should do.  I feel these drugs cause more harm than good.  I started to really watch what I am eating, started to excersise more and hopefully it might come down.  If not, then I have no idea what to do.  Totally disgusted.",5,1,1
I took one and only one tablet with my evening meal with a glass of water.  I got a headache that lasted into the next day.  I was sick to my stomach the second morning.  I had a major gallbladder attack at 1pm that lasted 2 hours. The pain felt like a sword stabbed through me and out my back. I called my physcian and he told me it was the welchol.  He told me if it didn't let up in the next hour or got too extreme for me to stand to go to the ER. I managed to stand the pain and it started to let up about an hour after I talked to the doctor.  I had an ultra sound the next day and I have NO gall stones. I was extremely constipated for 3 days from one tablet.  ,5,1,1

I have only been up for  little over a month. Started on my 2nd bottle of it.  Go back to my Dr. the first of December and will they will draw my blood to check how I am doing.

"I take welchol not for high cholesterol but because I had my gallbladder removed. I was experiencing terrible diarhea because my body could not absorb any fat that came into my body through food, so my doctor prescribed welchol. It helps absorb the fat in my system so I don't have uncontrollable diarhea any more. 3 of those big pills is rough at first but it saved my life now I can live normally again. I have had no side effects from welchol.",4,5,5

I took Welchol for over 6 months and could count on half a dozen ""accidents"" a week.  I am now treating my cholesterol with diet and exercize.  I am really unhappy about all of my doctors who do not think daily diarrhea is a problem. ""Just learn to live with it.""  I looked up colesvalem because it was mentioned on a discovery health tv show as a treatment for Habba Syndrome.  It may get rid of diarrhea for some people, but not for me.  Oh yeah, it did lower my cholesterol, because with all that diarrhea I was not getting any nutrition out of my food.  Starvation lowers choloesterol.",2,1,4
"It worked well the first 3 months I used it.  The main problem is that I take two other medications, and the Welchol has to be taken 4 hours before or after.  So, I forget to take it quite often.  ",2,3,2

"I just wanted to respond after reading almostadoc's comment.  The liver and kidneys REMOVE medications/toxins from your bloodstream. They don't add medications to your blood stream so this medication is absorbed through your gut into your bloodstream like other medications.  I haven't had my cholesterol checked since being on this, only been on it two months.  Do NOT take this medication with other medications as it can prevent the absorption of those other ones.  I also cannot take statins and I am beginning to have pain in my feet and my memory is also being affected.  There is no real proof that these medications increase your life span.  Also, cholesterol is needed for brain function.  I am going to stay on this until my cholesterol is checked but then I am going to quit taking it and see what happens using fish oil and other more natural supplements.  To the person who asked about taking this for chronic diarrhea.  It does work and is used for Irritable Bowel Syndrome at times. I am a consumer of the medication as well as a nurse (not almost a nurse but a nurse).  ",2,2,3

I have been had a horrible stomach pain along with nausea and diahrrea after my gall bladder removed.  Doctor prescribed this medication to me because he thinks I'm now has too much bile in my stomach.  The problem is still persist after taking it for a week.

"Been taking the powder form for 2 weeks - immediate indegestion followed by chronic constipation and severe intestinal cramping. Only way to dissolve powder is in a cup of water heated for 4 mins. Despite vigorous stirring, the liquid turns to a sludge in minutes.  I've not had my bloodwork since starting this medication, but I'm of the opinion the side-effects are not worth any A1C or LDL count lowering as a result.",1,1,2
"The first night after I took Welchol, I absolutely could not sleep.  I did not connect it to the Welchol, but when the insomnia continued night after night, I made the connection.  I was willing to continue taking the drug, however, because it immediately reduced my appetite and I was never hungry.  But after six days of almost no sleep, I experienced a visual migraine for the first time in my life.  It was a really scary experience, and I stopped taking the Welchol immediately.  That was months ago, and I have not had any reoccurrence of the visual migraine.  Although this drug supposedly is not absorbed by the body, the fact that there is no explanation for its effect on lowering blood sugar (one of its benefits) means that it has unknown physiological effects.  Apparently for me, the insomnia was such an effect, and six days of almost no sleep can result in migraines, visual or otherwise.  So be careful with this drug!",3,1,1

I'm not sure why it was prescribed for me but I have an appoitment tommorrow and it will be my first question. ",4,1,1

Having just been given the drug Welchol by my Dr. for usage I am wondering if you would recommend the dosage.....Dr. said 6 pills a day all at one time....(they are as big as horse pills) which I find utterly difficult to absorb.....and if I want to I could use the powder form but my past usages for any tupe of a powder form merely makes me gag!  I cannot do it..... Having taken 6 of the pills today I experienced hot flashes....and now I want to know if this is the usual....I am rather afraid of these dosages and would like an alternative of something normally smaller....Please review this request and get back to me.....Sally Brown [email protected],5,1,1

"Was experiencing heart palpations and although my blood pressure was slightly elevated, it was not my Dr's issue.  I had Baratric Stomach Bypass in 1986 (my Dr was the first to perform in US).  Although had dramatic success, the insanity of it allowed me to figure ways to overeat & for 23 yrs have yo-yo'd up/down in weight.  Was not high in cholesterol, but was borderline diabetic, & with severe heart palpations, he put me on Nexium & Welchol. 1 each in AM, 1 Welchol before a meal with high cholesterol.  Palpations are gone, I lost weight back to the lowest I was after stomach surgery.  I do experience itching on back and hands occasional leg/foot cramps & muscle aches. My blood work came back excellent on all counts last month.  It has been a blessing to me.",5,5,5
"I have been on WelChol for 3mos and I'm happy with the result. The only side effect for me is large stool and constipation. I can deal with that, rather than having a high cholest. and could be having a stroke or heart attack. No muscle pain whatsoever. I have gone down 77 points, but still above the 200 mark. Granted I am watching my diet very closely now, I cut out all red meats, and most of high-cholest. foods. I stay mostly on veggie diets, and work out 3 times a week. I believe within another 3mos, I will bring my cholest. down to a normal range.  My doc almost prescribed me statin meds which might have all sort of side effects and I am not too keen of doing that. So if WelChol doesn't give me constipation, I would rate it all 5 stars.",5,4,5
"Welchol Oral caused by sugar level to drop; remember I am taking Welchol for high cholesterol. It was diffcult to work out a schedule to take it.  You can not take it for four hours after taking other medications. I took three a day.  It was so bad that I would pass out or feel as if I were going to pass out.  My body ached.  It felt as if I would break if I tried to bend over. I discussed this with my Dr. Since, I have stopped taking Welchol, I feel so much better.  I have noted on my drug list I can not take Welchol.",1,1,1
"Warning! Be careful with this drug as I recommend not taking it. I've been on it for about 6 months and have stopped. I'll never take it again. Had severe muscle pain (especially arms) and in both knees. Haven't used it for several days now and side effects are 75% better. Moreover, it had only a minimal effect on lowering cholesteral.

After 4 months on it my lipids were LDL = 74 and total Cholesterol = 185. I like to research meds too so, I know welchol could cause constipation but if you take it along with a meal and an 8oz drink it is not a problem. Also, it does not pass through my liver or kidneys because it does not enter the bloodstream so it CANNOT MEDICALLY cause muscle pain or cramps. Some people I talk with are side effect profile junkies. If it says it on the internet, they have that reaction from it. I am into safe medications and this by far is one of the safest medications you can take. Women can even take it during pregnancy. When my wife was pregnant she could hardly take any over the counter meds much less prescription meds. Oh well, sorry I went through all this but if you cannot tell I am in complete support of this medication and I have done my medical research. I hate to see all these negative comments about something that can really make a difference in your life medically. People are always more likely to voice complaints then compliments or satisfaction.",4,4,5
I have been taking it for less than 1month for Crohns. It has totally changed my life. I went from chronic diarrea to basically none right away. After 20yrs of living my life around bathrooms I can finally just live it!,5,5,5
i have IBS and diarrea i am not sure of this medicine as i do not have diadetes or high cholestorol,1,1,1
"I've been on this drug for nearly a month, the side effects have been horrible at best. Bloating, large stools, discolored stools, muscle pain, muscle weakness and severe shortness of breath, just to name the most prevalent. My last cholesterol check put it at 227, which is much lower than it was when I had a heart attack in early August of 2009.   I cannot take statins, and from my personal research and 15 years experience working in cardio-pulmonary medicine I'm thoroughly convinced cholesterol has little or nothing to do with coronary artery disease. Consequently, when I next visit my cardiologist and he tells me my cholesterol is too high, I'll tell him I don't give a damn. If he want to argue the point, I'll fire him! I'm 69 years old, 6 feet tall, male, weigh 204 and still working 4 to 6 days a week. I didn't have any problems until I started taking cholesterol lowering drugs. And, I sincerely believe that taking these drugs will not make me live one day longer. It took 69 years of hard living to plug two small areas of my left anterior descending coronary artery by 85 percent. A pair of stents now hold those areas open. Does anyone believe for one minute that any of these drugs will make them live longer?  Sorry about the rant. Just tired of doctors who don't seem to have a lick of common sense and want to push pills.",1,1,1
Two months on WelChol and I started noticing hair loss.  Age 65.  Have not noticed others with hair losee while taking this drug.  I've stopped taking it to see what happens.  Very expensive and seems like 6 pills a day is excessive.,2,1,2
"Just started taking this for high Cholesterol (178) never in my life have I had high blood pressure, seen eye doctor and blood pressure up, is it WelChol? Seen eye doc for vision getting worst. Is it WelChol? 52 retired Marine, work out daily and watch my diet. Any one got same?",4,2,2
This is easy to take.  I take it twice a day at lunch and dinner.  Lowered my cholesterol in a major way.  No other side effects.  Great drug.  Been on it 6 months.  Tried everything else for cholesterol.  This is very effective so far.,5,5,5
"I am a 56 year old woman taking Welchol for high chloesterol/LDL.  After taking 2 pills a day, experienced low blood sugar symptoms that really scared me.  Stopped taking it for a couple of days because it scared me so bad.  Started taking 1 pill a day when my doctor's nurse assured me the low blood sugar symptoms wasn't from taking Welchol.  After only a couple of days of taking only 1 pill a day, experienced muscle and head pain, gas, feeling weak/sleepy, cough, blurry vision, and flu-like symptoms. Life's too short to be feeling bad from a medicine that's suppose to help me feel better.  It may help others for their health issues, but it isn't for me.",2,1,1
I have been having low back pain daily for several months now and am wondering if anyone else has noticed having the same.  Don't know if it is just a coincidence or is a possible side effect of this drug since it started around the time I started Welchol.  I have trouble getting six pills a day down let alone swallowing those big things so I have to cut them in two so now have twelve to take daily.   ,2,2,2
"I've been very pleased with this medication.  My cholesterol has gone done, my bowel movements, which use to be loose and hard to control, have improved, and I've lost 16 pounds.  I've been using it for about 4-5 months.  My doctor said it is full of fiber so taking it 30 minutes before a meal helps fill me up and helps control my portions.  Also, due to the fiber filled pills, my bowel movements are now firm and I don't have to rush to the bathroom like a madwoman.  It's a triple benefit! Five stars all they way!",5,5,5
"I started taking this medication 2 months ago. First few days had stomach pains, but that has subsided. The main thing I noticed was weight loss, 10 pounds within the first month. That was a plus for me. I take the medicine after lunch 3 pills and dinner 3 pills with an 8 ounce glass of water.",3,4,3
"I have high cholesterhol but also Gastroparesis where my food does not digest,it lays in my stomach causing me to be nauseated all the time.  My Gastro doctor was ready to send me to Pittsburgh Hospital that could not figure out what to do, I went to my reg. doctor for my cholesterhol check-up and he wanted me to go off the statins and take the Welchol because he believed between the stomach problems and cholesterhol I solve them both.  I have been on Welchol for one month.  I finally feel like I have my life back.  A llittle constipation but not much can handle it.  I only take 2 in the morning, before this I would go to work and be sick all day and come home and have to lay down and not move just to keep the nausea at a comfortable level.   So I thank my reg. doctor for recommending this and I have no real problem with any side effects.  ",5,5,5

I have had three heart attacks and I can't help but wonder what effect this has had on my heart!!!",5,1,2
I have taken this drug for a month.  I am having terrible side effects with itching from head to toe in a frenzy and a rash above my ear.  I've yet to find a drug that I can take that has no side effects. I've tried them all for high cholesterol and triglyserides.  I feel like this medication is dangerous for me.,3,1,2
Have colon damage from radiation to pelvis in '94 which has caused severe diarrhea and multiple hosp. stays. Unable to use cholestid due to severe muscle pain.  This has been a miracle drug. I take 1 with breakfast and 1 with supper. My only complaints are severe dry skin and hair and the tablets are not easy to swallow. I am taking each in the middle of a meal which helps move it along. ,4,5,5
"I got leg and muscle pains with other meds but NOT with this one. In fact, I noticed feeling better right away. Dr. told me food was not necessary when I took them, but taking them with food and enough liquid is key. (put one in a glass of water to see how it dispurses, and how long-lesson!) Now the PRICE is what keeps me from taking them steady.(unemployed)  Help!",5,4,5
I have been taking welchol for almost a month and haven't had too much trouble with it except for having excessive saliva at night to the point of nearly getting strangled and coughing so that I can't get to sleep. I haven't seen this particular side effect listed with the drug. This is getting to be very distressing.,2,2,2

"I could not take most cholesterol lowering drugs due to muscle pain. I started taking WelChol about 6 months ago because my Dr. told me that WelChol worked in the gut, and very rarely had muscle pain side effects. I started having muscle pain, but because I'm heavy I figured the pain in my legs, knees, etc. was from being overweight. I didn't put two and two together. Duh. Recently I decided to look on the net for the side effects of WelChol and saw that muscle pain is one of the side effects for a certain percentage of people. So, I stopped taking the WelChol and now after a week, the pain is nearly all gone!! It's like a miracle. Now I can take my dog on walks and get things done. I had started feeling like an old lady.  I am middle aged...but not old! It was depressing.  I don't think the medication is worth it.  If I can't exercise because of pain, how ridiculous is that?! ",2,1,3
extreme tiredness.,3,3,3
Started taking this medication on last week. Have taken for one week. The problem with this medication is constipation. I will continue to take it and use some stool softener to ease the problem..,4,2,3

Have experienced swelling in my feet. Has anyone else experienced this as a side effect of Welchol?,3,4,5
"Can't take statins because of muscle problems, and Dr. wanted me to try Welchol 6 weeks ago.  Took it for a month.  I had diarhea, aquired a bad sore behind upper front teeth, and had a severe outbreak of some sort of rash that started on front of legs below the knee and went all the way around the legs.  I feel the Welchol brought it all on, so I stopped it now for two weeks to see if they go away.  Sore is somewhat better and the rash is almost gone.  Bowels quite a bit better too.  I wish they would just quit messing with me!  Also would like to lower cholesterol some way.  I am not taking any more of those medicines.",1,1,1

I had my gallbladder removed in 1997 and have had terriable stomach problems.  I have been on this medicine for 2 years now and it has been a God send.  I am now able to eat out with friends and not have to hunt a restroom before we leave.  Which is very uncomfortable.  Now I can enjoy going out with no worries.  Much better than the drinks I had to try first. ,4,5,5

Also stomach pain and bloating . But the most frightening was when my right hand began shaking uncontroablly like parkinson's. I have stopped the drug and now the constipation,stomach pain  and shaking have disappeared. ",2,1,2

"I like others could not take statin drugs any more. I was on statins for over 10 years before leg cramps. Stopped taking anything other than supplements and eating proper foods but cholesterol went up over 200. Along with some high blood pressure I ended up having a TIA/stroke. Started taking Welchol about a year ago.Take 6 a day after working up to that fairly quickly. aside of the constipation that I take some natural colon cleans products like turkey rhubarb, drinke prine juice ect. My cholesterol is way down in the 150's tri's also. I am extermely happy with it.",5,3,5
Didn't work for me.,1,1,1

"Good grief.  I actually lived through the three days of taking ONE a day.  I am unable to take statins so doc tried this.  Had neurologic problems including leg weakness and cramping and neck and eye movement difficulty.  (I have invisible MS.  The Welchol highly intensified my neurologic problems.)  As one with extremely rare SVT runs, I experienced this, as well.  (I had also had soy sauce which probably intensified the runs.)  The on call nurse told me to go into ER, however, I had recalled that I had started the Welchol and stuck it out until it subsided this morning.  I cannot believe there is such a shortage of easy-to-tolerate, effective drugs out there for elevated cholesterol!  I am a 57 y/o female and petite at 130 and am a stroke/heart attack waiting to happen.  ",1,1,1
"Started Welchol in December of 08. Within 3 weeks my sole of my feet were killing me. It's a burning pain that won't go away. I have to wear Crocs all day. I have to wear slip on rubber soled shoes to walk. I no longer can wear sneakers. The medicine only brought my cholesterol( it was 434) down to 424. Hardly worth all the pains in my legs, back knees, the constipation and wakeful nights. Get real!! This medicine is no different than the statins. The drug companies are using us for experimentation. I stopped taking it to see if my symptoms will stop.",4,1,1
Flushed and itchy face,1,1,1
I can't take statins because of muscle cramping. Been on Welchol before and quit because of the intestinal discomfort.  Doctor wanted me back on it as LDL levels were too high.  Still having constipation and cramping and am not up to the full 6 pill a day dose.  I really hate this stuff and doubt if I will stay on it for very long. ,3,2,3

"After first day of taking 4 pills , two in AM then 2 at night w/food. Had severe diarrea, no appetite. Today is second day will skip dosage to recover then I will try 1 or 2 per day and see. Curious so many reviews reported constipation mine was just the opposite.",3,1,3
"I seldom had heartburn until I started taking Welchol 2 tabs a day and Rowasa 4 capsules a day (Omega 30.  I can't take statins.  Been the route wiht Questran which I am sure caused hair loss, Zocor, Crestor which caused muscle pain in shoulders and arms.  Started on Welchol 2 years ago and I am still not happy with the side effects.  I also have large stools and flatulence.  My Colonoscopy was normal except for diverticulosis.  I just don't feel comfortable taking this med so I am going to tell the doctor I can't handle it anymore.  I was happy to have daily bm's but never constant.  I can't say I have experienced any muscle pain except for leg cramps at night on occasion.  I am 75.  There has to be a supplement in a health store that would work. I just don't like the heartburn because I feel it could cause other esophageal problems.  My tests are still high and I walk for exercise.",2,1,2
My voice is breaking up after a few words. Has there been reports of Welchol causing irritation of the larynx?,5,3,3
"I cannot take statins, so the doctor put me on this med. I have been taking for 1 month and have started getting leg pains like with the statins. Just had labs done and will see tomorrow if it has helped there. Don't think I can keep taking since my legs are hurting worse every day.",2,2,2
"this is a miracle drug for IBS. I only take 1 pill a day and no more diarrhea, no more sick-nervous feeling in my stomach. I only wish I could have found this drug years ago!",5,4,4

"My Dr added Welchol to my Zetia to ""kick it up a notch"". First it was 4 pills daily and then 6.  My cholesterol dropped a few points but the triglycerides (sp) were up 20 points... and this is after I gave up all alcohol. I have stopped taking both meds because of the side effects.  The constipation, muscle weakness, weight gain, joint pain. I have had to take cordisone shots in my knee because of stiffness and pain. Seriously, having lower cholesterol may help me live longer, but with all those side effects, I'm not sure I want to! ",2,1,2
"I am a 57 year old female.  For the past few years I have been taking 3 pills at nite.  I have been suffering from intestinal spasms for the past 2 years and have had a battery of tests twice, with negative results.  In the past 6 months I have gone from 3 to 6 pills per day, and have now had stomach pains to go along with the spasms.  I just completed the second round of tests.  I have just found out the other day that Welchol should be taken 4 hours apart from any other medication and it really does work.  No more stomach pains, and we will see about the spasms.  ",3,2,2

Anyone else out there with the same side effect?",5,5,5

"Was given drug 1xday to control IBS symptoms..worked great...but having a very bad time with muscle weakness.  I'm going to cut back to every other day or when I know I'll be going out to dinner and see if that helps. Others are reporting muscle weakness, so I'm going to start there.",5,3,5
Given to control diarrhea,5,5,5
"I was prescribed this medication to control my IBS.  For that problem, I have had great results.  My FP wanted me to increase the dosage to get full advantage of the cholestorol reduction, but any increase resulted in constipation.  My greatest complaint is the muscle weakness.  Some days I can hardly walk, but I push myself.  It would be a hard decision to make, whether to have issues with IBS again, or to stop the muscle fatigue.  I would like them both to go away.

Slightly High Cholesterol and Triglycerides. Tried Tricor and was dizzy 4 times a day. Since Welchol no more dizzy spells but awaiting test results. Dr. told me to take 2 per day. I take 1 to see what happens. Will certainly increase dose to 2 if needed.,5,5,4
"I was on it for 6 monthsand now stopped on my own.  First it was pain in upper back, hard time swallowing and then threwing up after taking the 2 pills with my dinner meal.

"Over the years, I have been treated with Mevacor, Lipitor, Niaspan/Red Yeast Rice and Zetia.  All of these produced the same negative side effects -- progressively worsening muscle/nerve distress. My primary care physician finally prescribed Welchol, one (1) each 625mg tablet twice daily, in hopes that this non-statin pharmaceutical would not cause the muscle/nerve distress experienced previously. Wrong -- the exact same statin-based symptons reappeared, with only a marginal cholesterol improvement. On 09/22/08, I reluctantly agreed with my physician's recommendation to increase my daily Welchol dosage to 2500mg (4 tablets). I followed this regimin for three days and was forced to give it up. I have decided to discontinue the usage of all prescription medications, minerals and supplements while I detoxify my body. P.S. I have chronic age-related degenerative disk disease of the lumbar spine with the associated pain. The additional abdominal, leg and shoulder pain attributable to the cholesterol-lowering medications became overwhelming. The pain was worsening over time with no apparent end in sight.",5,2,3

Metformin 1000 2X's a day had basically stopped working for me and my PCP decided to put me on Xigduo 10/1000.

I started with Xigduo over 2 years ago. Initially it was a big hard on my stomach but after a few weeks my body adjusted. I have lost over 75lbs and no longer injecting insulin everyday. Also my AC1 has been consistent under 5.9. a win win!,4,5,5
"Xigduo was easy to take just one tablet/day. One ingredient makes you urinate a lot to expel the sugar  so it can be inconvenient in the middle of the night. Otherwise, it is very helpful in reducing blood sugar  with literally no side effects except for the frequent urination.",5,5,5
"Couldn't be happier with this drug. Lost 50 pounds and dropped my AIC a full point, with no change to diet.",5,5,5
"I took the Xigduo for two days and progressively got worse.  After the first day, I was fatigued and felt a little dizzy when I got up to go to the bathroom (which was quite often).  I did not sleep well the first night but thought it might have been for other reasons.  After taking it again I started noticing that I could hear my heart beat in my ears.  It wasn't racing, more like a labored beating.  I began to feel like my upper body was being squeezed and had spells where I felt like it was hard to get my breath.  I felt like my lower mid section (intestines and kidney area) was putting pressure on my pelvic area of the body. I honestly had thoughts of my body being on the verge of death.  This scared me and I decided not to take the medicine any longer. ",1,1,1
"I am newly diagnosed. I have found after a month my sugars are consistent. It does make me sweat like ""dripping"". I am also less tolerant to heat and humidity. I take my med before dinner it seems to work better for me. I lost 15 lbs the first 2 weeks! I am now losing about a lb. A week and are following an AD A diet. My insurance HMO does not cover this med but my MD has plenty of samples.I am an RN and very happy with this so far.",5,5,5
"I started Xigduo XR the day after Thanksgiving (11-28-14). I was not feeling well to begin with and had upper respiratory/cold. Started itching with a rash after two pills. Discontinued and called the doctor. Tried the medication again on 12-13-14 and with one pill had a rash again. Thought that the reaction the first time was the other medications I was on due to the cold, but the second time I was off the cold medicine/antibiotic. This is one drug that I cannot take.
